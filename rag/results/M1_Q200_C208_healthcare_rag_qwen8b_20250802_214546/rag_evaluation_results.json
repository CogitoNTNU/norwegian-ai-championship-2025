                    "troduction\n\nAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a group of conditions that include ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. It is a type of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is responsible for one-third of total deaths in people older than 35. Some forms of CHD can be asymptomatic, but ACS is always symptomatic.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nACS is a manifestation of CHD (coronary heart disease) and usually a result of plaque disruption in coronary arteries (atherosclerosis). The common risk factors for the disease are smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, male sex, physical inactivity, family obesity, and poor nutritional practices. Cocaine abuse can also lead to vasospasm.

The American Heart Association, along with the American College of Cardiology, are avid proponents of heart disease awareness. Millions of dollars go toward educating the public every year on this topic.[16] However, it is essential that all healthcare providers regularly educate our patients on possible heart disease presentations so our patients can seek rapid, appropriate help.\n\nAccording to the 2018 USRDS report, kidney disease is rising in the United States of America.[17] Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of electrolyte abnormalities and may lead to T-wave changes.",

ACS frequently serves as the initial presentation of CVD. Approximately 5.8 million new cases of ischemic heart disease were reported across the 57 member countries of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2019. The median age-standardized incidence rate was 293.3 per 100,000 people, with an interquartile range of 195.8 to 529.5. CVD continues to be the primary cause of death in ESC countries, contributing to nearly 2.2 million fatalities in women and over 1.9 million deaths in men, according to the latest data. Ischemic heart disease remains the leading cause of CVD mortality, accounting for 38% of deaths in women and 44% in men.[8]\n\nThe estimated annual incidence of myocardial infarction in the United States includes 550,000 new cases and 200,000 recurrent cases.",

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

Testicular torsion is the most significant cause of testicular loss.\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nAs the testicle twists around the spermatic cord, venous blood flow is cut off, leading to venous congestion and ischemia of the testicle. The testicle will become tender, swollen, and possibly erythematous. As the testicle further twists, the arterial blood supply is cut off, which leads to further testicular ischemia and, eventually, necrosis. [4]\n\nIn most individuals, the testicle rotates between 90-180 degrees and compromises blood flow. Complete torsion is rare and quickly decreases the viability of the testes.

It has been validated in several studies in ruling out torsion. The TWIST tool includes:\n\nHard testis - 2\n\nSwelling - 2\n\nNausea/vomiting - 1\n\nAbsent cremasteric reflex - 1\n\nHigh riding testis - 1\n\nThe higher the score, the greater the probability that the patient has torsion.

Only 20% of patients are premenarchal, and 50% of these will have a normal ovary. The majority of reproductive-age females with torsion had a benign ovarian mass.[3] Pregnancy is also an independent risk factor for torsion. In a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with torsion, 8 to 15% of them were pregnant.[1]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nTorsion occurs when the ovary twists over the supporting ligaments, the infundibulopelvic ligament, and the utero-ovarian ligament.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

This arterial network allows for the safe mobilization of the ureter during surgery when proper exposure from the surrounding structures is crucial. However, the ureter cannot be resected proximally and distally simultaneously, which will overly compromise its blood supply.\n\nThe ureter's venous and lymphatic drainage mirrors that of the arterial supply.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

For those not receiving thrombolytics, only levels of SBP higher than 220 mmHg or DBP higher than 120 mmHg should be lowered as hypertension in acute stroke is usually transient and may be protective. A reasonable goal is about a 15% decrease in mean arterial pressure.\n\nIn an acute hemorrhagic stroke, reduction of SBP to lower than 140 mmHg may improve functional outcomes.",

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

Cardiac toxicity, including prolongation of the QRS and QTc intervals leading to ventricular arrhythmias, is the main concern with the use of this drug combination.\n\n**Body Packers and Stuffers**\n\nTransporting illicit drugs in the body has become increasingly common over the past 2 decades.

When patients increase the dose or duration of opioid use, toxicity becomes a potential complication. Although the annual rates of transition are low, toxicity often occurs when individuals move from the nonmedical use of prescription opioids to heroin.\n\nOpioid overdose occurs when excessive unopposed stimulation of the opiate pathway leads to decreased respiratory effort and, potentially, death. The frequency of opioid overdoses is rapidly increasing. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with opioids being the most common culprit. According to the CDC, more than 1,000 emergency department visits reported daily are related to opioid misuse, and about 91 opioid overdose deaths are documented every day.",

However, healthcare workers need to know that in many cases, the results of a toxicology screen are not immediately available, and clinical acumen is required. Toxicological screens take place for various reasons, including a forensic investigation, rape, use of illicit drugs, and drug overdose. While consent is recommended before such testing, some patients may not be able to provide consent for whatever reason. In such scenarios, as long as the clinician is acting in good faith for the benefit of the patient or a legal warrant, then testing can be done without consent.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=406&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=406)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.",

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.

This interaction can result in centrilobular (zone 3) hepatic injury and hepatocellular death, along with the potential for nephrotoxicity.\n\nThe only approved antidote for acetaminophen overdose and toxicity is _N_ -acetylcysteine (NAC).[25] NAC acts as a precursor to glutathione synthesis, aiding in restoring intracellular glutathione stores to neutralize the NAPQI compound, directly inactivating NAPQI. NAC can be administered orally or via the IV route. The IV administration of NAC is typically preferred because vomiting is common with acetaminophen overdose.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al.

Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2]\n\n**Physical**\n\nThe physical exam should include:\n\n- Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms\n\n- General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress\n\n- Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles)\n\n- Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)\n\n- Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus\n\n- Heart exam\n\n- Lung exam\n\n- Abdominal exam\n\n- Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMany facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)\n\n- Chest x-ray\n\n- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase\n\n- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated\n\n- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. [3][4]\n\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. [5][6]\n\n**Pneumothorax (PTX)**\n\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. [7][8]\n\n**Pericardial tamponade**\n\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure. Needle pericardiotomy or pericardial window to relieve pressure inside the pericardial sack.[9]\n\n**Aortic dissection**\n\nOften immediate surgery is required; consult cardiothoracic surgery early. CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12]\n\n**Esophageal perforation**\n\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11]\n\n**Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\n\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Embolism\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n\n- Muscle or skeletal pain\n\n- Esophageal rupture\n\n- Pericarditis\n\n- Pneumonia shingles\n\n- Pneumothorax\n\n- Pulmonary embolism\n\n- Cervical radiculopathy\n\n- Esophageal spasm\n\n## Pearls and Other Issues\n\nAortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nChest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382)\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nJ\u00e4nig W.

A workup must focus on ruling out serious pathology before a physician considers more benign causes.\n\n## Etiology\n\nIt sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shoulders as well.[1] Somatic pain is more specific than visceral pain, and patients will usually be able to point to a specific spot. Somatic pain is also less likely to refer to other parts of the body. Common descriptors of somatic pain are sharp, stabbing, and poking.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nIn the emergency department, chest pain is the second most common complaint comprising approximately 5% of all emergency department visits. In evaluating for chest pain, the provider should always consider life-threatening causes of chest pain. These are listed below with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain based on a study by Fruerfaard et al. [2]\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 31%\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE), 2%\n\n- Pneumothorax (PTX), unreported\n\n- Pericardial tamponade, unreported (pericarditis 4%)\n\n- Aortic dissection, 1%\n\n- Esophageal perforation, unreported\n\nOther common causes of chest pain with approximate percent occurrence in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain include:\n\n- Gastrointestinal reflux disease, 30%\n\n- Musculoskeletal causes, 28%\n\n- Pneumonia/pleuritis, 2%\n\n- Herpes zoster 0.5%\n\n- Pericarditis, unreported\n\n## History and Physical\n\n**History**\n\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint.\n\n- Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest?\n\n- Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse?\n\n- Duration: How long did the pain last?\n\n- Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words.\n\n- Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried.\n\n- Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain.\n\n- Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up?\n\nAsk about other symptoms, such as:\n\n- Shortness of breath\n\n- Nausea and vomiting\n\n- Fever\n\n- Diaphoresis\n\n- Cough\n\n- Dyspepsia\n\n- Edema\n\n- Calf pain or swelling\n\n- Recent illness\n\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\n\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use.\n\nOnce you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2]\n\n## Etiology\n\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away.[3][4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nPlacental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders, specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and renal failure. These can result in Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.\n\nWith the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.[5][3]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies.[6][7]\n\nThe clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n\n**Class 1: Mild**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding.\n\n- Slight uterine tenderness\n\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n\n- No signs of fetal distress\n\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure.\n\n- Evidence of fetal distress\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia\n\n**Class 3: Severe**\n\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding\n\n- Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation\n\n- Maternal shock\n\n- Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy\n\n- Fetal death\n\nA classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation.\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOnce the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa.\n\n## History and Physical\n\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome.\n\nThe history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen.\n\nThe most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. If bleeding is present, the quantity and characteristic of the blood, as well as the presence of clots, is evaluated. Remember, the absence of vaginal bleeding does not eliminate the diagnosis of placental abruption.\n\nEvaluation of vital signs to detect tachycardia or hypotension, which may be indicators of a concealed hemorrhage, are taken. Blood specimens such as a complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, clotting profile, and type and RH may be collected. These laboratory values do not aid in diagnosing placental abruption but provide baseline data against which to evaluate the patient\u2019s condition over time.\n\nEvaluation of fetal well-being is also included in the examination. Begin with auscultation of fetal heart sounds and ask about fetal movement, specifically recent changes in activity patterns. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is initiated to identify prolonged bradycardia, decreased variability, and the presence of late decelerations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.[8][9][10]\n\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\n\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\n\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\n\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus.[11][12]\n\nWomen classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity.\n\nDelivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, the patient needs to be monitored for postpartum hemorrhage and alterations in the clotting profile. A neonatal team must be in the delivery room to receive and manage the infant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nBleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa. Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the patient's care. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.\n\n- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa\n\n- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa\n\n- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to that in placenta previa.\n\n- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.\n\n- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis depends on when the patient presents to the hospital. If the bleeding continues, both maternal and fetal lives are at stake. Partial placenta separation is associated with low mortality compared to full separation; however, in both cases, without an emergent cesarean section, fetal demise may occur. The condition accounts for 5% to 8% of maternal deaths today.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications that can manifest with placental abruption are as follows:\n\n- Severe hemorrhage\n\n- Fetal demise\n\n- Maternal death\n\n- Delivering premature infant\n\n- Coagulopathy\n\n- Transfusion-associated complications\n\n- Hysterectomy\n\n- Cesarean section means future deliveries are all via cesarean section\n\n- Recurrence has been reported in 4% to 12% of cases\n\n- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events have been reported in women with placental abruption\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered.\n\nWhile the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation.[13][14]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption. Besides the hemorrhage, the other morbidity is related to blood transfusions, the prematurity of the fetus, hysterectomy, and cesarean section (which makes the need for future cesarean sections more likely). Recurrence rates of 3% to 10% are reported.[2][15]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17041&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/placental-abruption/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17041)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17041/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17041)\n\n[![Placental Abruption](/books/NBK482335/bin/Placental__Abruption.gif)](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK482335/figure/article-17041.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPlacental Abruption.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPeptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies leading to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[1][2][3] Other factors such as smoking and alcohol may also contribute.\n\nOther risk factors include lower socioeconomic status (poor hygiene and eating habits), atrophic gastritis, anxiety and stress, steroids, vitamin deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, MEN syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. Factors specific to gastric ulcers include gastric stasis, ischemia of gastric mucosa, and duodeno-gastric reflux.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is declining and is currently estimated to be between 5-10%. It tends to be less prevalent in developed countries. Just as there has been a downward trend in the overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease, so too has there been a decline in the overall rate of complications.[1] Even though the overall incidence of complications is declining, complications including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction are responsible for nearly 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.[5] Upper GI bleeding is the most common complication of peptic ulcer disease. The next most common complication is perforation. The annual incidence of upper GI bleeding secondary to a peptic ulcer is estimated to be between 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals. In comparison, ulcer perforation is expected to be 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals. Advanced age is a risk factor as 60% of patients with PUD are older than 60. Infections with Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are each identified as risk factors for the development of bleeding ulcers and peptic ulcer perforation.[6]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe ulcerogenic process occurs as a result of damage to the protective mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. H.pylori infections and the use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin are known to damage the mucosal lining. The cost to the mucosal lining in the setting of an H.pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the host's inflammatory response. In the case of NSAID (and aspirin) use, mucosal damage is secondary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins which are important in maintaining mucosal integrity.[1] Once the mucosal layer is disrupted, the gastric epithelium is exposed to acid, and the ulcerative process ensues. If the process continues, the ulcer deepens reaching the serosal layer. A perforation occurs once the serosal layer is breached at which point the gastric contents are released into the abdominal cavity.[7]\n\nGastric ulcers are classified into four types based on location.[8]\n\n- **Type 1** : in the antrum, near the lesser curvature\n\n- **Type 2** : combined gastric and duodenal ulcer\n\n- **Type 3** : Prepyloric ulcer\n\n- **Type 4** : ulcer in the proximal stomach or cardia\n\nGastric ulcers are most commonly found in the lesser curvature (55%), followed by a combination of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly located in the first part of the duodenum.\n\nGastric ulcers have malignant potential compared to duodenal ulcers that do not have cancerous risk. A gastric ulcer greater than 3 cm is called a giant gastric ulcer which has a 6%-23% chance to turn into malignancy. In previous literature, the cancer rate in endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers ranges from 2.4%\u201321%.[9][10]\n\n## Histopathology\n\nMicroscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. Peptic ulcers have four prototypical zones:\n\n1. Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas\n\n1. Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins\n\n1. Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue\n\n1. Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans\n\n## History and Physical\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease may initially be asymptomatic, most patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will present with symptoms. Special populations such as the extremes of age (young or elderly), immunocompromised, and those with altered level of consciousness may prove to be more challenging in obtaining a reliable history. When an honest account is obtainable, a detailed history may identify other symptoms that may have been present before ulcer perforation. The most common symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease is dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain. This pain may be vague upper abdominal discomfort or it may be localized to either the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, or epigastrium. Gastric ulcers may be worsened by food whereas pain from a duodenal ulcer may be delayed 2-5 hours after eating. Patients who are experiencing bleeding from a peptic ulcer may complain of nausea, hematemesis, or melanotic stools. Some patients may report bright red blood per rectum or maroon-colored stool if the upper gi bleeding is brisk.\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer perforation typically will complain of sudden and severe epigastric pain. Pain while initially localized, quickly becomes more generalized in location. Patients may present with symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope secondary to hypotension from blood loss or SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)/sepsis. After several hours, abdominal pain may temporarily improve though it is still reproducible by movement. If there is a delay in seeking medical attention and the perforation is not walled off, patients are likely to experience increasing abdominal distension along with clinical manifestations of SIRS/sepsis.[5][11]\n\nA thorough physical examination should be done on all patients complaining of abdominal pain. Those with a perforated peptic ulcer are likely to have diffuse abdominal tenderness that progresses to guarding and rigidity. Rectal examination may demonstrate positive guaiac stools. Patients are likely to be tachycardic and may be hypotensive. They may be febrile and have mental status changes if there has been a delay in presentation.[5]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of a patient in whom perforated peptic ulcer is suspected should be done quickly as the morbidity and mortality increase significantly with time. Even if a perforated peptic ulcer is suspected due to history and physical examination, diagnostic studies should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible etiologies. Typical workup includes labs and imaging studies. Standard labs should include complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and lipase levels (to rule out pancreatitis). Blood type and screening should be done as well. A set of blood cultures and lactic acid should be done on patients meeting the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Lactic acid will help elucidate coexistent ischemia. A urinalysis can be done in patients with similar pain or those with urinary symptoms.\n\nImaging studies should be obtained once the patient is stabilized. While plain abdominal films or chest x-ray may demonstrate free air, a computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will have the highest yield diagnostically. Intravenous (IV) or oral contrast is not required to illustrate pneumoperitoneum, but IV contrast may be used in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain/peritonitis.\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nPerforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.[7] An initial emergent surgery consultation is required in all patients with peritonitis even before definitive diagnosis. Patients should be resuscitated with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Administration of early intravenous antibiotics should be considered, especially for patients presenting with SIRS criteria. Once the diagnosis of peptic ulcer perforation is made, a nasogastric tube should be placed, and IV proton pump inhibitor should be administered, IV antibiotics should be given, and a surgical evaluation must be done. Then the decision can be made regarding whether the patient will require surgery.\n\nSepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.[7] Given the high prevalence of sepsis and its associated mortality, antibiotics should be administered to all patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. Antibiotics should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole is a reasonable choice as is monotherapy with a combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e., ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam).[12]\n\nIntravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.[1][13]\n\nThe mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.[14] Surgery will typically consist of a peritoneal lavage of 5-10 liters of saline followed by an interrupted sutured closure of the perforated ulcer followed by an omental patch (Roseo-Graham patch). A drain is placed in the dependent areas and the abdomen is closed. The surgical drain is removed on postoperative days 3-5. This procedure can be done by an open approach or laparoscopically as there have been no significant differences in terms of mortality or clinically significant outcomes when comparing the two methods. A select number of patients may be chosen to forego surgery in favor of medical treatment alone. This option is a decision that would be made by the surgical consultant and would be limited to patients less than 70 years old with early presentation (less than 24 hours), mild/localized symptoms, and in stable condition. In such patients, perforated peptic ulcer is managed by iv fluids, antibiotics, Ryle's tube aspiration, constant monitoring of urine output, and electrolytes. This is referred to as the Hermen-Taylor regimen.[7][13] After 12 weeks follow-up gastroscopy must be done.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n\n- Aortic dissection\n\n- Appendicitis\n\n- Boerhaave syndrome\n\n- Cholecystitis\n\n- Cholelithiasis\n\n- Choledocholithiasis\n\n- Diverticulitis\n\n- Duodenitis\n\n- Esophagitis\n\n- Foreign body ingestion\n\n- Gastritis\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n- Hernia\n\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n\n- Neoplasm\n\n- Nephrolithiasis\n\n- Pyelonephritis\n\n- Small bowel obstruction\n\n- Ureterolithiasis\n\n- Volvulus\n\n## Surgical Oncology\n\nGastric ulcers are premalignant and hence biopsy of the ulcer or perforation margins are indicated in such patients. If found positive for neoplasia, thorough staging using endoscopy and imaging is used to stage and grade the disease, followed by resection or a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is recommended.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe mortality rate of perforated peptic ulcer is ten times higher than that seen with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. Though bleeding is a more common complication than perforation (6:1), the mortality rate is 5-fold higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6]\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include:\n\n- Hypovolemia\n\n- Shock\n\n- Sepsis\n\n- Gastrocolic fistula formation\n\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\n\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nManaging a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938)\n\n[![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nPneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLanas A, Chan FKL.

However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.\n\n- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.\n\n- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUpper airway obstruction refers to an anatomic narrowing or occlusion, resulting in a decreased ability to move air (ventilate). Upper airway obstruction may be acute or chronic. Upper airway obstruction may also be partial or complete, with complete obstruction indicating a total inability to get air in or out of the lungs. Often partial and complete acute causes of airway obstruction require emergency intervention, or they may be fatal. This is because acute obstruction causes a decreased ability to ventilate, which can be fatal in a matter of minutes. Chronic airway obstruction may produce a cardiopulmonary compromise that may eventually also lead to morbidity or death. The upper airway may be acutely or chronically obstructed by nasal and oral pharyngeal pathology. The anatomical area where the resistance to air is highest is the nasal valve, and even mild deviation in this area can lead to significant upper airway obstruction.[1][2][3]\n\n## Etiology\n\nAny pathology that compromises airflow from the nasopharynx and oropharynx to the lungs can cause upper airway obstruction. Often, etiologies that cause upper airway obstruction involve inflammation, infection, or trauma of the airway structures. An anatomic variant may also cause or contribute to obstruction. Causes of airway obstruction include deviated septum, foreign body ingestion, macroglossia, tracheal webs, tracheal atresia, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, rhinitis, polyps, enlarged tonsils, lipoma of the neck, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cancers, edema from epiglottitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, anaphylaxis, turbinate hypertrophy, and chemical or thermal burns. Obstructive sleep apnea is a medical condition that is a subset of sleep apnea and is considered a chronic cause of airway obstruction.[4]\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nMost children who die from airway obstruction injuries are usually younger than four years of age. In adults, airway obstruction is more common with inflammation, infection, and trauma. Airway obstruction is a common cause of emergency department visits.[4]\n\n## History and Physical\n\nIn cases of acute obstruction of the airway, a history of the events leading to the obstruction may be critical to deciding the intervention necessary to alleviate the potentially life-threatening symptoms. Often, secondary to the obstruction, the patient may be unable to give this history, and health care providers may have to rely on family or bystanders for pertinent history. Making a diagnosis of airway obstruction requires a thorough exam of the head and neck. Patients with acute obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion, trauma, or anaphylaxis, provide an acute challenge to the healthcare provider because these often require rapid diagnosis and intervention. These patients often present with acute distress, altered mentation, and other signs of inability to move air. Patients may also present in an obtunded state or cardiopulmonary arrest. The physical exam should be focused on finding correctable sources of obstruction, especially in patients in acute distress. Nasal passages should be inspected, as well as the oropharynx. The neck should be examined entirely for pathology that may be causing external compression on airway structures. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may present with obesity and a wide and short neck. Often the tongue may be large, and the mandible may be small. Adjuncts to the physical exam include nasal speculum with a light source, rigid or flexible endoscopy, and direct laryngoscopy.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn cases of acute upper airway obstruction, evaluation should be prompt, and the provider should be prepared to proceed to intervention with limited delay. All necessary airway equipment should be made available at the time of evaluation in case immediate intervention is required. The nasopharyngeal area may be evaluated with a flexible or rigid endoscope. Direct laryngoscopy is another tool that may also be helpful not only for diagnosis but also in case of intervention. Imaging techniques are available, but extreme caution should be utilized in patients with an acute obstruction or chronic obstruction with acute distress. Obtaining imaging should not delay the correction of obstruction in patients in acute distress. In these cases, imaging may be helpful in determining etiology after the obstruction has been alleviated. Imaging modalities that are used to assess airway obstruction include the lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. CT scans produce images that can assess both bony structures and soft tissues. The airway diameter can be evaluated, as well. The latest CT scans are fast and can create three-dimensional images. Again caution must be undertaken when deciding if the patient is stable for such diagnostic testing. MRI can also be quite helpful in determining the etiology of airway obstruction. MRI is of particular benefit when evaluating soft tissue masses and surrounding structures. Besides generating three-dimensional images, MRI does not produce radiation, and dye is not always used. The limitations of MRI are availability and cost.[5][6]\n\n## Treatment / Management\n\nThe immediate goal in the management of patients with airway obstruction is relieving the obstruction, so air exchange (oxygenation and ventilation) can proceed. In an acute obstruction of the airway, this may be critical because if left uncorrected, obstruction is often fatal in a matter of minutes. Correction of airway obstruction may be achieved by correcting the underlying pathology, but also may require intervention that alleviates the obstruction without correcting the underlying pathology, especially in urgent cases. When preparing to treat a patient with potential acute airway obstruction, all anticipated equipment and personnel should be available as soon as possible. This includes airway supplies for nasotracheal and endotracheal intubation, as well as, surgical airway equipment. Experts in airway management should be sought out as available. These may include anesthesia providers, emergency medicine providers, respiratory therapists, and critical care providers. Surgical consultation for possible surgical airway should be considered before the need for surgical airway arises. Additional equipment that might be of benefit in a difficult airway situation such as a bronchoscope should also be obtained as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to the patient and attempts to reposition the patient, such as a chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver, should be undertaken. Cervical spine precautions should be observed in patients believed to be involved in trauma leading to their airway compromise. Immediate and definitive relief of obstruction may include removal of foreign body, nasotracheal intubation, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Additional procedures such as jet insufflation may provide temporary relief. Efforts to treat the underlying cause of the obstruction should also be considered. In cases of infectious etiology, these should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated. In the case of obstructing masses, these may be worked up after the airway is secured, and proper surgical consultation should be obtained. In more chronic causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, diagnostic studies should be performed, and patients may require intervention while sleeping and possible surgery.[7][8]\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute upper airway obstruction:\n\n- Aspiration\n\n- Infection\n\n- Hemorrhage\n\n- Angioedema\n\n- Iatrogenic (e.g., post-surgical, instrumental)\n\n- Blunt trauma\n\n- Inhalation injury\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\nThe differential diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction:\n\n- Infection\n\n- Post-intubation\n\n- Amyloidosis\n\n- Sarcoidosis\n\n- Tumor\n\n- Collagen vascular disease\n\n- Mediastinal mass\n\n- Esophageal tumor\n\n- Cardiovascular anomaly\n\n- Neuromuscular disease\n\n- Idiopathic\n\n- Tonsillar enlargement in children\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis of airway obstruction depends on the etiology of the condition. Generally, the prognosis of inflammatory and infectious causes is more favorable than that of malignancy.\n\n## Complications\n\nThe complications of airway obstruction are:\n\n- Respiratory failure\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Cardiac arrest\n\n- Death\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nAirway obstruction can occur both in the hospital and at home. Thus, all healthcare workers must know how to manage this life-threatening emergency. Because death can occur within minutes, an interprofessional team approach is necessary to save the life of the patient. All healthcare workers who look after patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Most hospitals now have a team of professionals who are in charge of intubation outside the operating room. In most cases, it is the nurse who first identifies the patient with respiratory distress and alerts the rest of the team.\n\nThe nurse is usually the one person who knows where the equipment to manage this emergency is kept and should have it available. Once the team has arrived, the key is to establish an open airway quickly, and this may be done by removing the foreign body, performing inhalation induction, or an awake tracheostomy.\n\nBoth the anesthesiologist and surgeon should be notified when a patient has an airway obstruction. The nurse anesthetist should be dedicated to the monitoring of the patient while the clinicians are attempting to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required.\n\nPerforming an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation\n\nSome patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10]\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12]\n\n## Review Questions\n\n- [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310)\n\n- [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310)\n\n[![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly \"Figure\")\n\n#### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly)\n\nFirst aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.
