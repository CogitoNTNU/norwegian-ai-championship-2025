Present guidelines recommend that elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs should be performed at a size of 5.5 cm in men and 5.0 cm in women, or if there is rapid expansion exceeding 0.5 cm over six months; endovascular repair is recommended when anatomically suitable due to its lower perioperative morbidity.
