During adult diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the ratio between 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate can rise from its usual 1:1 to a peak of 10:1. Given that the nitroprusside test for ketones exclusively measures acetoacetate and acetone, it may result in false-negative findings in the initial stages of DKA.
