In cases of atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat roughly 300 times per minute in a consistent saw-toothed pattern; conversely, atrial flutter results in an unpredictable and irregular heartbeat in the lower chambers (ventricles), accompanied by a lack of flat segments on the ECG and no visible P waves.
