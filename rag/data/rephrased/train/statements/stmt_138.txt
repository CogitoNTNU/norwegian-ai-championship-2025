During an alcohol septal ablation procedure, successful septal reduction is established when there's more than a 50% decrease in the peak gradient of the left ventricular outflow tract, and achieving this involves completely blocking off the first septal perforator by injecting it with 1-2 cc of absolute alcohol while ensuring that the balloon remains inflated for precisely 10 minutes following the final alcohol injection.
