Current guidelines suggest that elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs should occur at a size of 5.5 cm for men and 5.0 cm for women, or if there is rapid enlargement exceeding 0.5 cm over six months; endovascular repair is preferred when anatomically appropriate due to its lower perioperative morbidity.
