When adults experience diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the normal 1:1 ratio of 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate can escalate to a maximum of 10:1. As the nitroprusside test for ketone detection is only capable of measuring acetoacetate and acetone, it may produce false-negative outcomes in early DKA cases.
