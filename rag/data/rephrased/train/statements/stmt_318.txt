Existing recommendations advise that elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair should be undertaken once they reach a size of 5.5 cm in males and 5.0 cm in females, or if there is rapid growth exceeding 0.5 cm within six months; endovascular repair is favored when anatomically feasible due to its reduced perioperative morbidity.
