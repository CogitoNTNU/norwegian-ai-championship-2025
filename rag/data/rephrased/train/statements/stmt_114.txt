Pure-tone audiometry findings in cases of acute acoustic trauma consistently reveal high-frequency hearing loss with a characteristic notch between 2 and 6 kHz, followed by recovery at 8 kHz. This pattern is distinct from presbycusis, which exhibits greater hearing loss at 8 kHz compared to 3, 4, or 6 kHz.
