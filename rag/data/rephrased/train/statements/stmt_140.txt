For an alcohol septal ablation procedure to result in a successful septal reduction, there must be over a 50% decline in the peak gradient of the left ventricular outflow tract; this requires fully occluding the first septal perforator and injecting it with 1-2 cc of absolute alcohol while keeping the balloon inflated for exactly 10 minutes after the last alcohol injection.
