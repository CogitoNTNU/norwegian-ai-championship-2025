The LDH-1 isozyme consists of four heart subunits (4H) and displays an increased inclination towards lactate, efficiently facilitating the transformation of lactate into pyruvate and NAD+ into NADH; in contrast, the LDHA subunit possesses a net charge of -6 and demonstrates a higher attraction to pyruvate.
