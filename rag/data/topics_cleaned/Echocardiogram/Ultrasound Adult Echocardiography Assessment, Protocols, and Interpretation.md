Echocardiography is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that examines the structure and function of the heart and great vessels. In 1950, the German scientist Wolfe Dieter Keidel utilized the transmitted ultrasonic wave technique to study the heart. However, he was not able to create information regarding cardiac function. In 1953, Dr. Inge, the father of echocardiography and inventor of M-Mode, and Dr. Helmut Hertz established a commercial ultrasound machine to study the heart. The development of echocardiography modalities such as M-Mode, A-mode, Doppler, transthoracic, transesophageal, contrast, stress echocardiography, and strain imaging took decades and helped achieve prompt diagnoses of various cardiac illnesses.
**Parasternal Long-axis View**
- **Structures**
- Chambers identified in this view the left atrium left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, and aorta
- Valves identified in this view: mitral valve and aortic valve
- This view helps identify regurgitant and stenotic jets of mitral and aortic valves. )
1. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular node re-entry tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia (sustained or non-sustained)
1. Evaluation of right ventricular function (fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, right index of myocardial performance, and pulmonary artery pressure in a patient with suspected pulmonary artery hypertension
1. Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance (>1 year) for diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension patients without a change in symptoms or physical examination
1. To guide management in patients diagnosed with pulmonary artery hypertension and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination
1. Patient in shock with an uncertain or suspected cardiac cause
1. For evaluation of a patient with a suspicion of myocardial infarction, either with chest pain or diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram indicating myocardial infarction
1. For diagnosis of valvular heart disease
1. To guide management in patients diagnosed with valvular heart disease and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination
1. Patients with suspicion of hypertensive heart disease, prosthetic valve dysfunction, infective endocarditis, heart failure, congenital heart disease, cardiac mass, pericardial disease, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, or cardiovascular source of embolus
**Indication for Transesophageal Echocardiography**
1. Transthoracic echo is nondiagnostic due to the patient's characteristics
1. To guide percutaneous noncoronary cardiac interventions such as closure device placement, radiofrequency ablation, and percutaneous valve procedures
1. To rule out cardiovascular sources such as embolus in patients with no other non-cardiac cause
1. To help decide cardioversion, anticoagulation, and ablation in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation
1. To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with moderate-high pretest probability
**Indication for Stress Echocardiography**
1. Patients with intermediate and high pre-test probability for coronary artery disease
1. Patients with a possible acute coronary syndrome (electrocardiogram: no ischemic changes or with left bundle branch block or electronically paced ventricular rhythm, low-risk thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score with either borderline or minimally elevated troponin, high-risk TIMI score with negative troponin)
- Patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia
- Patients with infrequent atrial premature contractions or ventricular premature contractions
- Patients with presyncope and no other evidence of cardiac disease
- Evaluation of left ventricle function for pre-operative screening in patients without symptoms or signs of cardiac disease
- Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance (\<1 year) for diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension patients without a change in symptoms or physical examination
- Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance in patients with a previous history of pulmonary embolism with normal right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure
**Absolute Contraindications Of Transesophageal Echocardiography**
- History of esophageal stricture, perforation, tumor, laceration, and diverticulum
- History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
- Severe atlantoaxial joint disorder
- Conditions that prevent neck flexion
**Inappropriate Transesophageal Echocardiography Indications**
- Routine use of transesophageal echocardiography in patients in whom decisions regarding diagnosis and management are already resolved by transthoracic echocardiography
- To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with low pretest probability
- To rule out cardiovascular sources such as embolus in patients with an obvious cardiac cause
- Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in whom the decision to anticoagulant already made
**Conditions In Which Stress Echocardiography Are Inappropriate**
- Patients with low pre-test probability for coronary artery disease
- Patients with definite acute coronary syndrome
**Equipment Requirement for Transthoracic Echocardiography**

- Echocardiography machine
- Transesophageal transducer
- Medication for sedation
- Transesophageal bite block
- Intravenous cannula for medications
- For the bubble study: agitated saline, 3-way stop cock, 2 10 ml syringes, and an extension tube connector
- Gel to lubricate transesophageal probe
- Topic anesthetics such as lidocaine to numb the pharynx
**Equipment Requirement for Stress Echocardiography**
- Echocardiography machine
- Exercise stress test machine
- Cardiac monitor to look for vitals
- Medications (such as dobutamine and atropine) to give stress in patients who can not perform an exercise stress test and medications (such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) to reverse the effect of dobutamine and atropine
- Cardiologist
- Echocardiogram technician
For transthoracic echocardiography, the patient should lie in the left lateral position.
The complications from transthoracic echocardiography and stress echocardiography are infrequent.

1. Arrhythmia
1. Toxic methemoglobinemia

1. Coronary spasm
1. Hypertension or hypotension secondary to medication
**Transthoracic echocardiography** : a non-invasive, low-cost, widely available, first-line diagnostic test to evaluate cardiac disease and function. It not only helps to diagnose cardiac disease but also provides useful information to guide therapy.
**Transesophageal echocardiography** : an invasive test in which transthoracic echo is inconclusive or needs further information on infectious endocarditis. The esophagus's proximity to the heart and absence of intervening structures such as the lung make the Transesophageal echo ideal for examining various important structures.
**Stress echocardiography** : including imaging in routine stress testing increases the sensitivity and specificity of the test in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography post-myocardial infarction helps in risk stratification, location, and extent of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography can also be used to risk-stratify patients before non-cardiac surgery, as resting echo does not provide essential prognostic information.
To perform echocardiography requires an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist and an echo technician. It is vital to take a proper history and perform a pre-procedure physical examination to determine the indication of the procedure. Communication between echo technicians and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in results.
