Often this impaired emptying is due to stones or biliary sludge. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute cholecystitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the risk factors for acute cholecystitis. - Describe the classic presentation for a patient with acute cholecystitis. - Explain the management of acute cholecystitis. - Explain how to improve patient outcomes by employing a well-integrated team approach to the management of patients with acute cholecystitis.

The pathophysiologic mechanism of acute cholecystitis is blockage of the cystic duct. Cholecystitis is a condition best treated with surgery; however, it can be treated conservatively if necessary. This condition can be associated with or without the presence of gallstones and can also be classified as acute or chronic. It is found both in men and women but may have a propensity for certain populations. It may also present with certain classic signs and symptoms. Acute cholecystitis may also be confused with other illnesses such as peptic ulcer disease, irritable bowel disease, and cardiac disease. Chronic and acute pancreatitis can also mimic gallbladder disease.[1][2][3] ## Etiology The etiology of acute cholecystitis is, by definition, cystic duct blockage, which causes inflammation. Normally, bile is made in the liver and travels down the bile duct, and is stored in the gallbladder. After eating certain foods, especially spicy or greasy foods, the gallbladder is stimulated to empty the bile of the gallbladder, through the cystic duct, down the bile duct into the duodenum. This process aids in food digestion. The gallbladder not only stores the bile, but it also can concentrate it. Concentrated bile is susceptible to precipitation forming stones when homeostasis is disrupted, which can occur due to bile stasis, supersaturation from the liver of
