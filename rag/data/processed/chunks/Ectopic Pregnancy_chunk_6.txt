be seen on transvaginal imaging at approximately 6 weeks of pregnancy.[13] Uterine fibroids or a high body mass index may hinder the accuracy of ultrasound imaging in detecting an early intrauterine pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in extreme cases, eg, with large obstructing uterine fibroids; however, its sensitivity and specificity require further investigation, and the potential risks associated with gadolinium contrast exposure should be carefully considered.[13] **Diagnostic Findings of Non-Fallopian Tube Pregnancies** Cervical pregnancies, once typically diagnosed in the second trimester or at the time of spontaneous abortion, can now be detected earlier through TVUS. Although no standardized treatment exists, conservative fertility-preserving management options do exist. Diagnosing ovarian pregnancies solely through TVUS imaging remains difficult due to the similarities between hemorrhagic cysts and ectopic pregnancies; therefore, histopathological confirmation based on Spiegelberg’s criteria is often required (Please refer to the **Histopathology** section for more information regarding Spiegelberg’s criteria).[11] Rare cases of abdominal pregnancies, which may involve implantation in the retroperitoneal space, liver, spleen, appendix, or even lung, are frequently identified only during surgical intervention. Clinical signs, eg, fetal malpresentation, oligohydramnios, and elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, can provide diagnostic clues.[2] Cesarean scar pregnancies present unique diagnostic challenges. TVUS, often supplemented with color Doppler imaging, is the preferred method. Key findings include a low-lying anterior gestational sac within the hysterotomy scar, a thin or absent myometrial layer between the sac and the bladder, and a prominent vascular pattern at the scar site. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be performed to help diagnose a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Early detection is crucial to prevent complications such as uterine rupture and severe hemorrhage.[5] Interstitial pregnancies present another diagnostic challenge. TVUS findings suggestive of interstitial implantation include the interstitial line sign, an eccentrically located gestational sac, and a surrounding myometrial mantle \<5 mm thick. Three-dimensional sonography improves detection accuracy, while MRI can be employed for inconclusive cases. Differentiating interstitial from cornual pregnancies is vital, as interstitial ectopic pregnancies have less capacity to expand and are associated with hemoperitoneum and life-threatening hemorrhage, while some cornual pregnancies may be able to progress without resulting in spontaneous abortion but have a risk of persistent vaginal bleeding, retained placenta at delivery, and uterine rupture.[2] ## Treatment / Management **Management of Ectopic Pregnancy** In general, the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy balances the management of the ectopic gestation with the aim of preserving a patient's reproductive capacity
