activation, potentially causing myocarditis, and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can further damage the right ventricular myocardium.[8] Respiratory failure in pulmonary embolism primarily arises from hemodynamic disturbances leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Additionally, there is the potential for right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale, which exacerbates hypoxemia and increases the risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke.[9] ## Indications Meticulous patient selection remains the cornerstone of endovascular strategies in pulmonary embolism management. Three critical considerations guide the decision to proceed with CDT: 1. Disease severity and acuity: 1. Massive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis is the primary choice, offering lower all-cause mortality.[10] In cases where systemic thrombolysis fails, endovascular approaches, including CDT, become potential options within a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) approach, considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and surgical embolectomy for life-saving situations.[11][12] 1. Submassive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis provides a mortality benefit but raises major bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage.[10][13]. American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association guidelines consider CDT for deterioration or when adverse prognosis indicators are present. The European Society of Cardiology advocates 2-step risk stratification with validated tools like the pulmonary embolism Severity Index followed by imaging and biomarker assessment.[3][14] If both clinical and objective assessments indicate high risk and impending cardiopulmonary deterioration is likely, CDT may be considered. This reflects the ongoing need for robust randomized trials. Existing data on ultrasound-assisted CDT shows promise; exceeding heparin alone improves right ventricular size within 24 hours without major bleeding or recurrent venous thromboembolism.[15] 1. Low-risk pulmonary embolism: Endovascular interventions are generally contraindicated due to low morbidity and mortality. The exception might be large saddle emboli without hemodynamic or right ventricular issues. Ongoing trials on optimal dosing and duration are underway.[16] 1. Major adverse bleeding risk: Balancing potential CDT benefits with individual bleeding risks is crucial. Comorbidities and bleeding history require careful evaluation. 1. Patient-specific considerations: Shared decision-making, incorporating patient values, preferences, and goals, is paramount. It ensures that treatment aligns with individual circumstances and desires. ## Contraindications Though thrombolysis is administered locally during CDT, there is a risk of systemic effects associated with thrombolysis therapy. Systemic thrombolytic therapy is implicated in many severe CDT complications, such as severe bleeding. Hence, practitioners must thoroughly review the patient's medical history before considering thrombolytic therapy (see **Table.** Contraindication for Thrombolytic Therapy).
