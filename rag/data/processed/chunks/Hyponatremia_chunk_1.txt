team ball sports, recreational hiking, and yoga.[2][1][3] The greatest risk factors for EAH are excessive hypotonic fluid consumption beyond the capacity for normal renal free water excretion, high ambient temperature, and longer exercise time, usually exceeding 2 hours. Several studies demonstrate a linear relationship between temperature and incidence of EAH.[5] Men and women are at equal risk for EAH when adjusted for body mass index and exercise duration.[4] Low oral intake, specifically of high sodium foods, may also contribute. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug use may exacerbate or propagate EAH by potentiating the water retention effects of ADH by the kidney.[2] EAH is commonly an incidental finding in asymptomatic athletes. Incidences of 5-51% are reported following endurance events where athletes are screened, or their serum is analyzed for another reason.[2][3] It is estimated that 0.1% to 1.0% of endurance athletes experience symptomatic EAH, with marathon runners, ultramarathon runners, Ironman athletes, long-distance backpackers, and military service members most commonly affected.[5][2][3] The incidence in military service members is 6.9 cases per 100,000 person-years.[6] ## Pathophysiology EAH stems from both increased consumption of hypotonic fluids and inappropriate water retention. Before and throughout strenuous physical activity, athletes often over hydrate with hypotonic fluids (water, sports drinks). When intake exceeds that of water lost via urine, sweat, and insensible respiratory and gastrointestinal losses (often greater than 1.5 liters), athletes may retain free water, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia.[2][4] The contribution of sodium loss from excessive sweat is controversial and not well characterized, as sweat loss varies greatly between individual athletes.[1][2] It is postulated that stimuli related to physical exertion may result in sympathetic activation of the hypothalamus, which stimulates ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary inappropriately during low osmolar states. These stimuli include pain, emotional stress, nausea, emesis, hypoglycemia, heat exposure, and medication use (particularly NSAIDs).[2][4] Elevated ADH leads to stimulation of renal V2 receptors, causing water reabsorption rather than excretion. The retained free water is returned to the extracellular fluid resulting in a net lowering of serum sodium concentration.[2] Subsequent hyponatremia results in an osmotic gradient that favors free water movement from the vascular space to the extravascular and intracellular spaces, leading to tissue edema (particularly brain and lung), which drives the most severe symptoms of EAH. ## History and Physical Prompt identification and differentiation from other common exertional injuries are essential to caring for an athlete with EAH. Healthcare providers should suspect EAH when athletes present
