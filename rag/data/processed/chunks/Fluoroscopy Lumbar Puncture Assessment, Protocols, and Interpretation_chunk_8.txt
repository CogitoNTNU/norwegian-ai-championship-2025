Additionally, LP is performed for therapeutic purposes to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. There is an increase in the need for FGLP due to the increasing number of patients having spine surgery, high BMIs, or due to multiple failed blind attempts, or fear of failed attempts. FGLP is associated with a reduced rate of failure of LP in patients who have high BMI, prior surgery, or significant degenerative disease.[10] FGLP has advantages of image guidance that can track the needle trajectory, reduce the number of attempts, reduce the chance of blood tap, and reduce the time required for the procedure.[4] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes FGLP is a significantly superior procedure to blind LP. It is associated with reduced postlumbar puncture headache (Level 1).[13] FGLP is a moderately skilled procedure and might injure patients significantly due to spinal cord injury if not performed correctly. Hence, it is essential to master the technique of the FGLP to obtain desired results safely. It is important to note that sedation doesn't always benefit the patient, as patients can not tell if they had root pain while steering the needle within the spinal canal. FGLP is a commonly performed procedure in radiology departments either for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We generally recommend that the clinical team try at least one attempt using the nonimage-guided bedside LP; however, this will negatively impact the radiology department.[2] [Level 3] The interprofessional clinical team requesting FGLP should understand this implication and comprehend that the clinicians might lose the skill of blind LP in the future. Clinicians should be aware of the contraindications and complications of the FGLP. It is important to note that FGLP is not immune to the complications of blind LP; however, they occur less frequently. Experienced nursing staff can assist the clinicians during the procedure and perform patient monitoring. Interprofessional coordination and communication will yield the best results from these diagnostic tests.
