by prostanoids and leukotrienes. This mediation occurs by the degradation of arachidonic acid and subsequent conversion into bioavailable eicosanoid compounds. Research of PLA has also focused on it playing a role in allergic and anaphylactic reactions through activation of mast cells and subsequent release of histamine. **Cytosolic PLA** The primary studied functions of cytosolic PLA depend on an increase in intracellular calcium that facilitates the translocation of the enzyme to intracellular phospholipid membranes around the nucleus. Binding of intracellular calcium to the enzyme allows this to occur by neutralizing anionic molecules in the enzyme and promoting hydrophobic interaction with membrane substrates. Once bound to the phospholipid membrane, many other enzymes help to regulate the activity of cytosolic PLA through phosphorylation. The important primary function of cytosolic PLA involves hydrolysis of arachidonic acid to promote the metabolism of substrates in either the cyclooxygenase (COX) or lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways. The resulting compounds are biologically active eicosanoids that play a vital role in intracellular immunity. Cytosolic PLA also plays a role in stimulating a potent immunologic enzyme known as NADPH oxidase that produces superoxide compounds to eliminate pathogens. Other notable functions of cytosolic PLA include cell cycle regulation of G1 phase progression. **Ca-Independent PLA** Researchers have studied the functions of Ca-independent PLA as playing an essential role in normal cell homeostasis. There have been implications regarding its role in the promotion of cell cycle progression and, paradoxically, apoptosis of cells depending on the target cell. Other studied functions of the enzyme include the proper formation of bones, glucose-dependent insulin secretion, maturation of sperm, proper function of skeletal and smooth muscle, and neuroaxonal regeneration in response to injury. **Lysosomal PLA** Lysosomal PLA plays a significant role in the degradation of phospholipids within lysosomes. Most notably, its function and high levels of expression in alveolar macrophages allow for surfactant phospholipid degradation. This process prevents the accumulation of phospholipids within cells. Failure of proper enzymatic function leads to phospholipidosis with notable phenotypic features in knockout mice, including splenomegaly and increased foam cell formation. Lysosomal PLA also plays an important immunological role through the processing of lipid antigens and subsequent use by CD1 proteins for presentation to leukocytes. This role has been examined regarding pulmonary infection with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Results indicate that lysosomal PLA plays an essential role in the formation of adaptive Th1 T-cell immunity to _M. tuberculosis_. **Adipose-Specific PLA** Adipose-specific PLA is a tumor suppressor
