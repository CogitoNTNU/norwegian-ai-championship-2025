β-2 receptors.[14][15] In addition to its effects on neurotransmitters, MDMA increases the levels of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), leading to fluid retention. This effect, coupled with excessive water intake, is implicated in the development of life-threatening hyponatremia and coma.[16] ## Toxicokinetics When ingested, MDMA is readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract with an onset between 20 minutes and 1 hour and peak concentrations occurring at 2 hours. MDMA is primarily metabolized hepatically through CYP2D6. The elimination half-life of MDMA is moderately slow at about 8 hours. MDMA takes about 40 hours (ie, 5 half-lives) to achieve over 95% drug clearance. Since some metabolites of MDMA are pharmacologically active, such as MDA, the duration of clinical effects may continue after clearance from the body.[6][17][18] ## History and Physical The presentation of acute MDMA toxicity is similar to amphetamines and includes tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. However, MDMA has less stimulant and more serotonergic effects compared to amphetamines and methamphetamines.[19] At low doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity, such as bruxism, restless legs, jaw clenching, hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness.[14] Significant life-threatening complications include serotonin syndrome, cardiac dysrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages.[8][20][21] Since MDMA undergoes metabolism via hepatic CYP2D6, severe hepatoxicity may occur, leading to fulminant liver failure.[22] Central nervous system (CNS) hyperactivity can lead to agitated delirium and seizures.[23][24] Because MDMA is a popular rave drug, the combination of intense physical activity with the sympathomimetic effects of the drug leads to an increase in body temperature that resembles heat stroke and could result in rhabdomyolysis.[25] Significant increases in fluid consumption by users coupled with the development of the syndrome of inappropriate diuretic syndrome (SIADH) may potentially contribute to the development of severe hyponatremia, leading to cerebral edema, seizures, and death.[26][27] ## Evaluation Diagnostic testing should be guided by the clinical presentation (history and physical exam). Initially, evaluation of the altered patient must include intravenous (IV) access, vital signs, rapid glucose check, and complete physical examination. Obtaining a core body temperature (rectal or bladder) is critical to diagnose life-threatening hyperthermia (>105 °F or >40.5 °C). Recommended lab tests are as follows: 1. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) to evaluate for: - Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia - Acute kidney injury - blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels - Rhabdomyolysis - creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels
