Medications** Antifibrotic medications, including pirfenidone and nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), are approved for use in IPF. Studies have shown that both drugs can slow disease progression and potentially reduce all-cause mortality and acute exacerbations.[54] Therefore, initiating therapy early is recommended. Initially, pirfenidone was thought to be effective in slowing the progression of IPF in patients with mild to moderate disease, but recent research suggests benefits even for those with more advanced stages (such as FVC \<50% predicted and/or DLCO \<35% predicted).[55][56] Both pirfenidone and nintedanib have been demonstrated to be equally effective in slowing the 24-month decrease in FVC and diffusion capacity.[43] The recommended daily dosage of pirfenidone is 267 mg (1 capsule) taken 3 times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 2403 mg divided into 3 doses. In addition, it is essential to monitor liver function tests regularly while on either drug, including liver and renal function tests. Typically, blood testing should be conducted before initiating therapy and regularly throughout treatment, with recommended intervals being monthly liver function tests for the first 6 months and then every 3 months.[57] Pirfenidone should be used cautiously in patients with impaired renal function, such as those with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min, and it should be avoided in patients on dialysis.[58] The recommended daily dosage of nintedanib is 150 mg twice daily. Nintedanib should be avoided in patients with moderate-to-severe liver impairment.[59] Similar to pirfenidone, liver function and enzymes should be monitored before initiating therapy and regularly throughout treatment, with monthly monitoring recommended for the first 3 to 6 months. Nintedanib has the potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly with medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.[59] The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with nintedanib include diarrhea and weight loss, while those for pirfenidone are rash, photosensitivity, and gastrointestinal discomfort.[43] Gastrointestinal adverse effects are the primary reason for discontinuing both medications.[60] Limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of medications such as sildenafil in reducing mortality and decreasing acute exacerbations.[61] **Lung transplant** Referral for a lung transplant is recommended early in the course of the disease, particularly for patients experiencing a progressive decline in lung function. Studies have demonstrated survival benefits for patients with IPF who undergo a lung transplant.[62] **Additional Treatments** Acute exacerbations can occur in IPF, leading to a rapid decline in lung function. When suspected, it is crucial to exclude factors like heart failure and consider and
