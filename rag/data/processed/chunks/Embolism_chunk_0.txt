PE typically originates as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. Together, PE and DVT form the spectrum of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Symptoms of PE vary and are often nonspecific, including dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and syncope. Severe cases may involve hemodynamic instability and signs of right ventricular strain. Diagnosis combines clinical probability scoring systems like the Wells and Geneva criteria with tests such as D-dimer levels, CT pulmonary angiography, and ultrasound. Hemodynamically unstable patients may require bedside imaging for rapid diagnosis. Management of PE includes supportive measures, anticoagulation as the mainstay of treatment, and reperfusion strategies for severe cases. Thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, and surgical embolectomy are options for hemodynamically unstable patients. Long-term anticoagulation is essential to prevent recurrence, with duration tailored to individual risk factors. Recognizing and promptly treating PE is critical to reducing its high mortality and morbidity rates. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in promptly recognizing the clinical features of PE, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional management approach to improve patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify the clinical features of acute pulmonary embolism. - Select the most appropriate diagnostic imaging modality for a patient with a suspected acute pulmonary embolism. - Differentiate between acute pulmonary embolism and other cardiopulmonary conditions. - Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

Most commonly, PE originates from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. PE usually occurs when a part of this thrombus breaks off and enters the pulmonary circulation. PE rarely occurs from embolizing other materials into the pulmonary circulation, eg, air, fat, or tumor cells.[1] Together, PE and DVT comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE), a significant cause
