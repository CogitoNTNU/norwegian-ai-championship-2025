team, with each member playing a critical role. Clinicians and advanced clinicians must recognize and promptly address the signs of eclampsia, particularly in emergency settings where rapid intervention is crucial, especially during active seizures. Nurses are responsible for closely monitoring patients and promptly relaying any changes in the patient’s condition to clinicians, ensuring that timely interventions (eg, administering anticonvulsant medication) are initiated. Communication between emergency clinicians and obstetricians is also essential, particularly when emergent delivery is necessary to manage the condition and safeguard maternal and fetal health. Pharmacists contribute by reviewing and verifying medication dosages, ensuring no dangerous drug interactions, and collaborating with clinicians to adjust treatments. Seamless communication across all healthcare professionals—including nurses, clinicians, pharmacists, and other support staff—is fundamental to ensuring patient safety and enhancing outcomes. In this patient-centered approach, all care team members must remain focused on the well-being of both the mother and child, providing coordinated, efficient care that leads to better overall team performance and patient outcomes in cases of eclampsia. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27632&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27632) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/eclampsia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27632) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27632/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27632) ## References 1.
