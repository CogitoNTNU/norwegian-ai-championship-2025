Cancer** Thromboembolism is a frequent complication in cancer patients due to the release of procoagulants from neoplastic cells. Several studies have demonstrated that LMWH is superior to VKAs in the treatment of VTE in cancer patients.[17] **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia** Although thrombocytopenia increases bleeding risk, it has been shown to predispose patients to venous thromboembolism. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is antibody-mediated with complications that include pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and ischemic limb necrosis. Therefore, estimation of the bleeding risk before initiation of anticoagulation is essential. The use of argatroban, lepirudin, or danaparoid is recommended over other non-heparin anticoagulants.[18] **Pregnancy** Anticoagulants are indicated in pregnancy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, valvular heart disease, and pregnancy-related complications in women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, antithrombin deficiency, or other thrombophilias who had a prior VTE.[19] Warfarin is more efficacious than unfractionated heparin for the prevention of thromboembolism in pregnant ladies with mechanical valves. But, warfarin therapy in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in fetal anomalies. ## Contraindications Anticoagulation should be avoided in patients with absolute contraindications, such as in the following conditions: - Active bleeding - Coagulopathy - Recent major surgeries - Acute intracranial hemorrhage - Major trauma Anticoagulation may be considered in those with relative contraindications such as the following conditions: - Gastrointestinal bleed - Low-risk surgeries - Aortic dissection or aneurysm Anticoagulation should be used cautiously in these patients:[20] - Geriatrics - Pregnant patients ## Equipment **Laboratory Monitoring and Testing for Anticoagulation** Measurement and monitoring of anticoagulation levels and concentrations may be indicated in certain situations like: 1. Bleeding 1. Thrombosis 1. Urgent or elective invasive procedures 1. Thrombolysis 1. Overdose 1. Therapeutic levels for multiple conditions 1. Preoperative testing 1. Liver disease Routine monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) levels is not generally indicated unless in certain conditions with high bleeding risk, such as neural procedures that require no anticoagulant effect. Assays for anti-10a or anti-2a activity are recommended methods in these conditions for quantitative information.[21] The initial testing in any individual with suspected bleeding history is listed below. Several point-of-care tests (POCT) for anticoagulation are used in operating rooms. POCT can measure bleedings assays like prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen assay, and whole blood platelet function test. - CBC with platelet count and morphology - Bleeding Time: An insensitive test that is not commonly in use.
