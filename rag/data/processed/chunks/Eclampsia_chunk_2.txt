27.5% in the US, with the variability in reported incidence likely arising from the underreporting of patients with milder conditions.[1] While preeclampsia is estimated to occur in 3% to 8% of pregnancies, the mortality rate is significantly higher in younger patients, ranging between 5% and 20%.[3] Results from a recent cross-sectional study of nearly 28 million live births between 2009 and 2017 showed that 0.3% were linked to eclampsia.[6] Another study's results, cited by the American Heart Association, reported an adjusted odds ratio for eclampsia in women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy of 65.9 (43.6â€“99.6).[7] Globally, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in gravidas and infants.[8] The prevalence of preeclampsia is approximately 4.6% worldwide, while eclampsia is estimated at 0.3%, according to the World Health Organization.[9] The incidence of eclampsia varies regionally, with low- and middle-resource countries reporting a higher incidence of 0.5%.[9] **Eclampsia Risk Factors** Eclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have many of the same risk factors: chronic hypertension, younger age, those with lower education levels, and first-time mothers.[10] According to the results from a recent eclampsia study, approximately one-third of eclampsia cases occurred in women younger than 20.[9] Other risk factors include: - Personal history of pregnancy hypertensive disorder - Family history of preeclampsia - Prepregnancy chronic hypertension - Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, renal disease, and autoimmune disorders - Maternal obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) - History of preterm birth less than 32 weeks of gestation [11] - Low socioeconomic status - Insufficient prenatal care [11] - Maternal age older than 35 - Multifetal gestation - Interval since previous birth of 10 or more years - African American ethnicity - In vitro fertilization [12][13] ## Pathophysiology Eclampsia and preeclampsia were once thought to be caused by "toxins" or "poisons" entering the gravida's bloodstream, leading to the term "toxemia of pregnancy."[14] Despite multiple studies that have posited several underlying mechanisms, the precise pathophysiology of eclampsia remains unclear.[11] Theories that have gained more support involve dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral blood flow autoregulation. The proposed BBB pathophysiologic mechanism suggests that eclampsia may result from disrupted cerebral blood flow autoregulation, similar to hypertensive encephalopathy. This disruption could cause BBB dysfunction, allowing fluids and proteins to enter brain tissue and potentially leading to seizures. The BBB, formed by endothelial cells in the capillaries, regulates the passage of molecules
