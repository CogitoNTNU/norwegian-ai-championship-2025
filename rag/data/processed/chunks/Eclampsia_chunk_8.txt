10 mg IV, with repeat doses every 20 minutes as needed to a maximum total of 20 mg.[11] Hydralazine works by dilating blood vessels, reducing vascular resistance, and relaxing the smooth muscles of precapillary arterioles, which helps lower blood pressure. Additionally, hydralazine is associated with improved placental circulation. Common adverse events include reflex tachycardia and increased cardiac output, while rarer adverse effects include dizziness, chest pain, fluid retention, and severe hypotension. Clinicians should be especially aware of potential hypotension when using hydralazine as patients with preeclampsia typically have decreased intravascular volume already, and hypotension may result in further uteroplacental insufficiency.[3] Therefore, hydralazine requires careful fluid balance and intravascular volume monitoring to avoid complications, including pulmonary edema.[3] - **Labetalol** : Labetalol is a beta blocker that dilates blood vessels and reduces vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure while maintaining normal peripheral and uteroplacental circulation. In many institutions, labetalol is preferred over other first-line antihypertensives. The recommended regimen for emergent blood pressure control is 10 to 20 mg IV initially, followed by 20 to 80 mg every 10 to 30 min up to a maximum dosage of 300 mg. Alternatively, an infusion of 1 to 2 mg/min IV may be administered. Labetalol reduces BP while maintaining peripheral circulation, including uteroplacental blood flow. Labetalol is effective with relatively mild adverse effects and is suitable for patients with heart failure or after a heart attack. However, it can cause bradycardia in both mother and fetus and should not be used with calcium channel blockers or in patients with certain conditions, including asthma or heart block.[2][11] - **Nifedipine** : Oral nifedipine may also be used for severe hypertension with a recommended dosage of 10 to 20 mg, repeated in 20 minutes if needed. A subsequent 10 to 20 mg dose may be administered every 2 to 6 hours up to a maximum daily dose of 180 mg. The protective renal effect and rapid onset are benefits of nifedipine.[20] Adverse effects include reflex tachycardia and headache.[2][11] - **Delivery Considerations** - **Delivery timing:** Eclampsia is an indication for delivery; cesarean delivery is not necessarily required. The mode of delivery should be based on various clinical features, including gestational age, fetal presentation, and cervical favorability. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Bishop Score](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18340)," for more information on cervical favorability. Due to the increased risk for labor induction failure, in pregnancies under 30 weeks gestation with an unfavorable cervix,
