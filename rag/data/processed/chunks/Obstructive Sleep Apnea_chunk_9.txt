Patients undergoing tracheostomy face numerous challenges, including home care, durable medical equipment needs, and family or partner education on proper tracheostomy management. Additionally, many patients with severe OSA requiring a tracheostomy often have comorbidities that further complicate treatment. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses for OSA include: - Asthma - Central sleep apnea - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Depression - Gastroesophageal reflux - Hypothyroidism - Narcolepsy - Periodic limb movement disorder ## Prognosis The short-term prognosis of OSA with treatment is generally favorable, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain. The primary challenge is poor adherence to CPAP therapy, with nearly 50% of patients discontinuing its use within the first month despite education.[80] Many individuals with OSA have comorbidities or are at an increased risk for adverse cardiac events and stroke. Consequently, individuals who do not adhere to CPAP are at a higher risk for cardiac and cerebral events, as well as increased annual healthcare-related costs.[81][82] Furthermore, OSA is also associated with pulmonary hypertension, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and daytime sedation, and these individuals have a high risk of motor vehicle accidents. The overall life expectancy of individuals with OSA is lower than that of the general population. OSA is known to impact cardiac function, especially in individuals with obesity.[83][84] Recent studies have shown that CPAP treatment improves left and right ventricular mechanics in patients with OSA.[85] ## Complications Complications from OSA can include: - Hypertension - Myocardial infarction - Atrial fibrillation - Congestive heart failure - Cerebrovascular accident - Depression - Sleeplessness-related accidents ## Deterrence and Patient Education Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with OSA. They should be advised to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and certain antidepressants, as these substances can worsen their condition. Patients should also be educated on the importance of proper sleep hygiene, ensuring sufficient sleep each night, and the risks of driving while drowsy. Adherence to CPAP use should be strongly encouraged, along with proper cleaning and maintenance of the machine to ensure optimal function. ## Pearls and Other Issues An association exists between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and OSA, although a definitive causal relationship has not been established. Up to 47% of patients with PTSD have difficulty maintaining sleep and are known to have a low arousal threshold.[86][87] Patients with both PTSD and OSA experience more severe symptoms of both disorders compared to those with only one condition.[88] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing OSA
