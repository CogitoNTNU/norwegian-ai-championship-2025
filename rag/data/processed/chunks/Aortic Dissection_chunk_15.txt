surgical or endovascular repair, patients require ongoing management to prevent recurrence and monitor for late complications: - Blood pressure control - Lifelong antihypertensive therapy is indicated to maintain a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Beta-blockers remain the first-line agents, and other antihypertensives, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, may be added based on patient tolerance and comorbidities. - Imaging surveillance - Regular imaging follow-up with CT, MRI, or echocardiography is critical to monitor for aneurysm formation, residual dissection, or complications like endoleaks. Initial follow-up is typically performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge, with annual imaging afterward. - Lifestyle modifications - Patients should be advised to avoid strenuous physical activity and heavy lifting to prevent increased aortic wall stress. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, weight management, and adherence to antihypertensive therapy, are crucial for long-term outcomes. - Management of complications - Late complications such as aneurysm development, recurrent dissection, or graft complications may necessitate reintervention. Decisions should be guided by imaging findings and clinical symptoms. ## Deterrence and Patient Education **Risk Factor Modification** Patients should be educated about the various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors contributing to AAD's development. This includes: - Hypertension management - Hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor for AAD. Strict blood pressure control is crucial, typically with a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg. Patients should understand the importance of adhering to antihypertensive medications, dietary modifications (eg, reduced sodium intake), regular exercise, and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. - Avoidance of stimulants - Cocaine and other stimulant drugs increase blood pressure and the risk of aortic dissection. Patient education should emphasize avoiding these substances and seeking help for substance use disorders. - Atherosclerosis management - Patients should be counseled on the importance of cholesterol management, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight. This involves regular lipid monitoring, dietary counseling, and smoking cessation support, as smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and increases the risk of dissection. - Screening for connective tissue disorders - Individuals with a family history of connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) or genetic predispositions should undergo regular cardiovascular screening. Identifying these conditions early allows for tailored monitoring and preventive strategies, such as early elective surgical intervention in cases of progressive aortic dilation. **Patient Awareness of Symptoms** Early recognition of AAD symptoms is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. Patients should
