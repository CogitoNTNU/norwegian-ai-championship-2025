squeeze. An indirect way to assess left ventricle function is via the E-point septal separation (EPSS), the smallest distance between the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and the interventricular septum during early diastole. The EPSS should be less than 7 mm, and a distance of 7 mm or greater indicates depressed left ventricular function. Diastolic dysfunction may falsely lower this distance, and mitral valve dysfunction may falsely increase this distance.[16] **Parasternal Short Axis** The phased array probe is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the parasternal long axis position so that the indicator is pointing towards the right hip. Otherwise, the probe's position is unchanged (still approximately the 4 intercostal space, just lateral to the sternum, with the probe's handle at a perpendicular angle to the chest). The footprint of the probe is aligned with the short axis of the patient’s heart in this view, where most of the screen displays the circular left ventricle, and anteriorly (top left of the screen) is the right ventricle, which should appear as a crescent shape. This view is ideal for assessing the left ventricle function. Still, it can also confirm the presence of pericardial effusion or signs of right heart strain, such as paradoxical septal motion and right ventricle enlargement. The overall function of the left ventricle is best assessed concentrically at the level of the papillary muscles. In this view, the operator can also look for wall motion abnormalities and correlate them with the echocardiogram. The left ventricle walls in a parasternal short axis are septal, anterior, lateral, posterior, and inferior, in clockwise order. **Apical 4-Chamber** The phased array probe is positioned at the apex of the heart, usually at approximately 5 O’clock on a male patient’s left nipple or laterally beneath the left breast at the apex of the heart on a female. Palpating the pulse of maximal impulse (PMI) and placing the probe there usually result in a perfect apical four-chamber view. Similar to the subxiphoid view, the footprint of the probe should be directed up towards the patient’s heart (handle of the probe parallel with the patient’s skin), but in this view, the footprint is facing the right shoulder, and the indicator is pointing towards the right superior iliac crest. In this view, the ventricles are closest to the probe at the top of the screen, the atria are furthest away from the probe at the bottom of
