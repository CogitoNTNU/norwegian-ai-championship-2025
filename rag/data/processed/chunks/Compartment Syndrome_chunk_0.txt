Persistently elevated intra-abdominal pressures (IAP) can cause long-term organ dysfunction and can be potentially fatal if not promptly recognized and treated. Many cases of elevated IAP go unrecognized because a physical exam is not sensitive in detecting this condition; therefore, it is essential to understand the risk factors and associated treatments of ACS. This review activity focuses on the pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of this condition, emphasizing the critical role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating ACS. **Objectives:** - Evaluate patients with significant fluid shifts, especially those with associated clinical instability, for abdominal compartment syndrome by routinely measuring intra-abdominal pressure and utilizing established criteria from the World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) guidelines. - Assess and evaluate the impact of elevated intra-abdominal pressure on surrounding organ systems, recognizing the potential for multi-organ dysfunction, and incorporate this holistic perspective into abdominal compartment syndrome management decisions. - Select appropriate interventions, whether medical or surgical, based on the patient's clinical presentation and IAP measurements, aiming for timely and effective abdominal compartment syndrome management. - Communicate effectively with interdisciplinary healthcare teams to ensure coordinated care and timely interventions for patients at risk or diagnosed with abdominal compartment syndrome.

These compartments are restricted by muscles and fascia, limiting the compartment's ability to expand as pressure progressively increases. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is especially well-studied due to its prevalence in critically ill patients and the potential for multisystem organ failure.[1][2][3] The World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) was created in 2004. This society standardized the definitions and guidelines for evaluating and treating ACS, as this disease process is often underdiagnosed in the medical field.[4][5] The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the steady-state
