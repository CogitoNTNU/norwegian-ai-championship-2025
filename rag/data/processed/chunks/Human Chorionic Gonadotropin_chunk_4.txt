than 55. In all nonpregnant patients, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, or other malignancies should be considered as potential sources of positive hCG results.[27] hCG levels can also help determine prognosis in these cases, with higher levels associated with a poor prognosis in testicular cancers.[28] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety Quality control and laboratory safety are integral to the accuracy and reliability of hCG testing. The routine use of control materials is crucial for monitoring assay performance, identifying analytical errors, and ensuring the consistency of results. Strict adherence to biosafety protocols, proper specimen handling, and regular maintenance of instrumentation are critical for minimizing contamination risks and maintaining a safe working environment. Furthermore, compliance with established laboratory standards and regulatory guidelines supports diagnostic accuracy and improves clinical outcomes. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective patient-centered care involving hCG testing and interpretation requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach grounded in strong clinical skills, strategic planning, ethical integrity, and seamless communication. Clinicians and advanced practitioners must possess the diagnostic acumen to interpret hCG levels within the appropriate clinical context, whether to confirm pregnancy, monitor gestational complications, or identify malignancies. Nurses play a vital role in specimen collection, patient education, and emotional support, ensuring patients understand the purpose and implications of hCG testing. Pharmacists contribute by evaluating the potential effects of medications on hCG levels and supporting informed therapeutic decisions. Understanding the utility and variability of different hCG assays is clinically relevant to a wide range of medical professionals. False-positive and false-negative testing have a large impact on patient care. All members of the healthcare team should be aware of common limitations in testing, such as urine assay false positives with hematuria, false negatives with dilute urine, and more obscure but still very relevant causes of inaccurate testing. Interpreting results that may be false should be undertaken with care to help prevent unnecessary testing and treatment.[29] Effective interprofessional communication is crucial for making timely clinical decisions, enabling all team members to collaborate in sharing relevant findings and coordinating follow-up care. Coordinated care ensures that abnormal results are promptly addressed, referrals are efficiently managed, and patients receive accurate information and support throughout their diagnostic journey. By aligning their roles and responsibilities, healthcare professionals can enhance patient safety, improve clinical outcomes, elevate team performance, and foster a high-performing, patient-centered care environment. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23019&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23019)
