size of a burn by using the patient's palm size to indicate 1% of TBSA. When calculating TBSA for fluid resuscitation or clinical diagnosis criteria, first-degree burns are not included, only second- and third-degree burns. Despite these tools, enormous amounts of variability in body surface area due to gender, age, and body mass index can make it challenging to provide a standardized method for estimating TBSA. Those with a larger body mass index often have an overestimated calculation of their burn TBSA. Advances in technology may allow for 3D body scanning to determine the TBSA of burns more accurately. Accurate estimation of TBSA is important for transfer to appropriate burn centers and to help dictate fluid resuscitation goals. The anesthesiologist needs to communicate openly with other healthcare professionals when accepting the care of a severely burned patient in the operating room to understand better the patient's fluid goals in the perioperative period. With the prevalence of miscalculations and the ill consequences of fluid creep, the astute anesthesiologist should be able to estimate the TBSA of a burn upon initial assessment to administer fluids accurately.[13][14] **Neuromuscular Blockade** A major concern with burn patients is the upregulation of acetylcholine receptors after a burn resulting in life-threatening hyperkalemia after using succinylcholine. In healthy patients, succinylcholine use is associated with only 0.5 mEq/L, but in the burn patient, this response is exaggerated. The increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia is likely associated with changes in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Recent evidence suggests that burn patients have upregulated alpha7 and gamma subunit genes producing more acetylcholine receptors spread throughout the body and slightly altered receptors. These altered receptors likely have abnormal electrophysiological interactions with succinylcholine producing more significant hyperkalemia. This upregulation of acetylcholine receptors does not happen fast enough for significant hyperkalemia to develop until approximately 24 to 48 hours after the initial burn injury. Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade happens much faster than the sensitivity to succinylcholine (within the 24-48 hour window). Thus, the presenting burn patient may require higher than usual doses of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade than expected. An increased dose can partially overcome resistance to the neuromuscular blockade produced by rocuronium. Rocuronium can provide reasonably good intubating conditions with a 1.2 mg/kg dose after a significant burn injury.[15][16][17] ## Complications **Infection** Severe burns can weaken the immune system due to increased cytokine inflammatory markers, leading to a greater risk of infection.
