Arterial aneurysms are defined as a permanent localized dilatation of the vessel, enlarging by at least 150% compared to a relatively normal diameter of the adjacent artery. The abdominal aortic aneurysm is characterized by abnormal focal dilation of the abdominal aorta that may be detected incidentally or at the time of rupture. Vigilant monitoring or treatment is required depending on the size of the aneurysm and symptomatic presentation. Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm are diverse and include atherosclerosis (most common), smoking, advanced age, male sex, being part of the White population, family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and prior history of aortic dissection. The course provides healthcare professionals with comprehensive insights into the evaluation and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms, emphasizing the importance of timely detection and intervention. Participants learn evidence-based practices for screening, assessing, and monitoring patients at high risk for AAA. The course highlights the critical role of an interprofessional team in ensuring early recognition and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Collaboration among clinicians, such as physicians, nurses, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals, enhances the ability to detect and treat AAA effectively, reducing the likelihood of rupture and increasing the chances of favorable outcomes for patients. **Objectives:** - Differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms to guide appropriate management strategies. - Apply guidelines for the management and surveillance of unruptured and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. - Implement evidence-based screening protocols for abdominal aortic aneurysm in clinical practice. - Collaborate and communicate with all members of the interprofessional team to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
