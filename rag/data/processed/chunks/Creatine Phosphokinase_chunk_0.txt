The phosphocreatine created from this reaction is used to supply tissues and cells that require substantial amounts of ATP, like the brain, skeletal muscles, and the heart.[2] CK is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Many conditions can cause derangement in CK levels, including rhabdomyolysis, heart disease, kidney disease, or medications.[3] As such, it is a diagnostic indicator for specifically rhabdomyolysis and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), among other medical disorders. ## Pathophysiology Creatine kinase (CK) is a compact enzyme of around 82 kDa found in both the cytosol and mitochondria of tissues with high energy demands.[4] In the cytosol, CK comprises 2 polypeptide subunits of around 42 kDa, and 2 subunits are found: M (muscle type) and B (brain type).[5] The genes for these subunits are located on different chromosomes: B on 14q32 and M on 19q13. These subunits allow the formation of 3 tissue-specific isoenzymes: CPK-MB (cardiac muscle), CPK-MM (skeletal muscle), and CPK-BB (brain). Typically, the ratio of subunits varies with muscle type: skeletal muscle (98% MM to 2% MB), cardiac muscle (70% to 80% MM and 20% to 30% MB), while the brain predominantly has the isoenzyme BB.[6] In mitochondria, 2 specific forms of CK exist: Mt-CK, a non-sarcomeric type called ubiquitous Mt-CK expressed in various tissues such as the brain, smooth muscle, and sperm, and a sarcomeric Mt-CK expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The mitochondrial CK isoform is an octamer consisting of 4 dimers each.[7] While mitochondrial CK is directly involved in forming PCr from mitochondrial ATP, cytosolic CK regenerates ATP from ADP using PCr. This happens at intracellular sites where ATP is used in the cell, with CK acting as an in situ ATP regenerator. Mt-CK and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit.[8] PCr generated by Mt-CK
