There is a growing body of evidence that TNM rating may better define SCLC, but there is no consensus on this approach yet. - SCLC is classified as LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC small cell based on the Veterans Affairs Lung study group (VALSG) classification. - LS-SCLC is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax and local lymph nodes, both mediastinal and hilar and supraclavicular nodes can be included in a single tolerable radiotherapy port (corresponding to TNM stages I through IIIB). - ES-SCLC has tumors beyond the boundaries of limited disease, including distant metastases, malignant pericardial or
