and is mainly caused by viral infections, although noninfectious etiologies may also contribute. Clinical presentation of acute myocarditis varies widely and may include febrile illness, mild chest pain, arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or sudden death. The clinical diagnosis of the condition can be challenging due to the nonspecific nature of its symptoms, and treatment is generally supportive.[2][3][4] The clinical course and prognosis of acute myocarditis are variable; while some patients recover fully within a few weeks, others experience an acute phase that progresses to chronic complications, such as dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosing acute myocarditis remains challenging due to its variable clinical presentation and significant overlap with other cardiovascular conditions. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly in younger patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of myocarditis but without conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). A recent history of febrile illness, viral prodrome, or signs indicative of connective tissue disease can further raise suspicion for myocarditis. Myocardial involvement may be focal or diffuse, contributing to the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations. According to the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP), acute myocarditis is defined as a clinical episode that occurs within one month of symptom onset.[5] ## Etiology Acute myocarditis can be broadly categorized into infectious and noninfectious causes. Viral infections are the most common identified etiology when a specific cause is determined.[6][7] However, in approximately 50% of cases, no definitive cause is identified, and the condition is classified as idiopathic. **Infectious Causes of Acute Myocarditis** - Viruses: Coxsackie and echoviruses are the most common cardiotropic viruses causing myocarditis. Other viral pathogens include HIV, adenovirus, hepatitis B and C, parvovirus B19, poliovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus.[8] - Bacteria: Common bacterial causes include _Legionella_ , _Staphylococcus_ species, _Salmonella_ , _Shigella_ , _Streptococcus_ species, _Clostridium_ , and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. - Parasites: Notable parasitic causes include _Trichinella spiralis_ (trichinosis) and _Schistosoma_ species (schistosomiasis). - Protozoa: The important protozoan pathogens include _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (the causative agent of Chagas disease) and _Toxoplasma gondii._ - Spirochetes: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , the causative agent of Lyme disease, can also lead to myocarditis. **Noninfectious Causes of Acute Myocarditis** Noninfectious causes of acute myocarditis encompass a broad spectrum of conditions and exposures. These include eosinophilic myocarditis and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Cardiotoxic drugs are also well-recognized contributors. Other noninfectious etiologies include systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease,
