Author Information and Affiliations #### Authors Abdulghani Sankari1; Kyle Chapman2; Saad Ullah. #### Affiliations 1 Wayne State University 2 West Virginia University Last Update: April 23, 2024. ## Continuing Education Activity Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disorder characterized by scarring of the lungs from an unknown cause. The condition has a poor long-term prognosis. Classic features of IPF include the gradual onset of shortness of breath, progressive dyspnea, and a dry, nonproductive cough. Pulmonary function tests usually reveal restrictive lung function impairment, decreased functional vital capacity, and diminished carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. Early diagnosis is pivotal for effective management, given the disease's tendency to progress rapidly in advanced stages. Diagnosis can often be established without biopsy through a comprehensive assessment of clinical history, imaging results, and exclusion of alternative conditions. However, a lung biopsy may be required in cases where diagnostic uncertainty persists. Imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography scans, frequently display a distinctive pattern of fibrosis, typically observed at the periphery of both lungs and more prominently concentrated at the bases, aiding in the diagnosis of IPF. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, a lung biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment strategies include supportive measures, oxygen supplementation as required, antifibrotic medications, and, in severe cases, lung transplantation, which stands as the sole curative option. This activity comprehensively reviews the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of IPF in adults, highlighting the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in its evaluation, diagnosis, and management. **Objectives:** - Identify early signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in patients presenting with gradual onset of dyspnea and nonproductive cough. - Implement evidence-based diagnostic algorithms to facilitate timely diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. - Apply appropriate treatment modalities based on individual patient needs and disease stage, including antifibrotic medications and supportive measures. - Collaborate with multidisciplinary healthcare teams to provide comprehensive care, optimize long-term management, and improve the quality of life for patients living with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
