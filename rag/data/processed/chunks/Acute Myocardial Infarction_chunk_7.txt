lightheadedness. Go to the emergency department as soon as possible. - Contact emergency services if nitroglycerin does not provide relief. - Adhere to a low-salt diet to help manage high blood pressure and reduce the heart's workload. - Enroll in cardiac rehabilitation designed to support individuals recovering from cardiac conditions, including AMI. - Cease smoking, as it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. - Remain compliant with medication administration. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes An interprofessional team specializing in heart disease manages AMI. In addition to the cardiologist, the team usually consists of a cardiac surgeon, an interventional cardiologist, an intensivist, a cardiac rehabilitation specialist, critical care or cardiology nurses, and physical therapists. Because AMI is potentially life-threatening, it is crucial to prioritize patient education regarding recognizing symptoms and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention. The pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and primary care providers should educate patients regarding nitroglycerin administration, emphasizing when to seek immediate medical attention if the medication does not provide relief. Time to reperfusion is limited, and early initiation of treatment can significantly improve outcomes. The care team's initial assessment needs to be timely and cardiology consulted immediately. The cardiologist evaluates the patient's condition, considering the duration of symptoms and contraindications, to determine the appropriate treatment approach. This may involve thrombolysis or PCI to restore blood flow to the blocked coronary artery. Patients with AMI require close monitoring and specialized care in the ICU. ICU nurses are crucial in monitoring vital signs, administering medications, assessing for complications, and promptly communicating abnormal clinical signs or laboratory parameters to the interprofessional team. Avoiding premature discharge is crucial because complications of an MI can manifest up to a week after the initial event. The interprofessional team should collaborate to ensure patients are stabilized, monitored appropriately, and educated on signs and symptoms that may indicate worsening or recurrent MI. Nurses play a vital role in educating patients about reducing risk factors for coronary artery disease. This education includes lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control. The involvement of a social worker or case manager is beneficial in facilitating home care arrangements, coordinating cardiac rehabilitation programs, and addressing the need for any support services patients may require at home. Pharmacists play a crucial role in addressing medication-related aspects of patient care. They provide education on appropriate medication dosing, potential adverse effects,
