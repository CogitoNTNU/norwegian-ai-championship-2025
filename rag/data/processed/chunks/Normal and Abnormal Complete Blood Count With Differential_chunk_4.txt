The normal reference interval in adults is usually 20% to 40% of the absolute WBC or 1000 to 4000 cells/µL. Lymphocytosis, which refers to an increase in the lymphocyte count, may be due to viral infection, pertussis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, hyposplenism, or lymphoproliferative disease. Lymphocytopenia, which refers to a decrease in the lymphocyte count, may be due to viral infection, bacterial infection, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease), malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, primary immunodeficiency diseases or medications.[16][17] **Monocyte count** The monocyte count is the number of monocytes per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 2% to 8% or 200 to 1000 cells/µL. Monocytosis, an increase in the monocyte count, can be caused by viral or parasitic infection, brucellosis, tuberculosis, listeriosis, endocarditis, granulomatous disease, autoimmune disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia, cigarette smoking, or medications. Monocytopenia, a decrease in the monocyte count, is observed in infection, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), aplastic anemia, lymphoproliferative disease (particularly hairy cell leukemia), or induced by medications. **Eosinophil count** The eosinophil count is the number of eosinophils per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 0% to 4% or 0 to 500 cells/µL. Eosinophilia, an increase in the eosinophil count, may be due to malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, parasitic infection (such as _Toxocara_ sp, Ascaris, _Strongyloides stercoralis_ , Schistosomiasis, Trichinella, Filariasis, Cysticercosis or Echinococcus), hypersensitivity reactions, connective tissue disease (such as polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis), atopic disease, skin disorders (such as psoriasis or scabies), idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, Loeffler syndrome, pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia, vasculitides (especially eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or induced by medications. Eosinopenia, a decrease in the eosinophil count, is seen in conditions such as acute stress, inflammation, or drug-induced (most notably glucocorticoids). **Basophil count** The basophil count is the number of basophils present per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 0.5% to 1% or 0 to 200 cells/µL. Basophillia, an increase in the basophil count, may be due to malignancy, myeloproliferative
