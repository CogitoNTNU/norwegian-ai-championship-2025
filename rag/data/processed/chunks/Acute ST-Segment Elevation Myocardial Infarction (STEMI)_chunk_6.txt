fibrinolytic therapy should be initiated within 30 minutes of the patient's arrival at the hospital.[29] Patients should be promptly transferred to a PCI center after starting lytic therapy. If fibrinolysis fails or signs of reocclusion or reinfarction, such as recurring ST-segment elevation, emerge, immediate angiography and rescue PCI is necessary.[30] Further administration of fibrinolytic is not recommended in such cases. Even when fibrinolysis appears successful, as indicated by significant resolution of ST-segment elevation (ie, >50% at 60â€“90 minutes), typical reperfusion arrhythmias, and relief of chest pain, early angiography within 2 to 24 hours is still advised.[31] Conditions that can mimic ACS, such as acute aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism, must be ruled out. Manual thrombus aspiration before PCI in patients with STEMI is a quick and cost-effective technique to reduce microvascular obstruction following PCI.[32] While the TAPAS study (Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction) initially suggested that thrombus aspiration before PCI could offer clinical benefits compared to PCI alone, subsequent research and meta-analyses did not significantly improve clinical outcomes.[33] Additionally, concerns about patient safety have emerged, with evidence demonstrating a higher risk of stroke in those undergoing thrombus aspiration compared to PCI alone, both at 1 month and 1 year postprocedure.[34][35] Reflecting these findings, the 2023 ESC guidelines for managing ACS advise against routine thrombus aspiration (Class III, Level of Evidence A). However, the guidelines suggest that thrombus aspiration may be considered in certain STEMI cases, particularly those with a high thrombotic burden following PCI. **Pharmacological Therapy** Nitroglycerin administration can reduce anginal pain. However, this drug should be avoided in patients who have used phosphodiesterase-inhibiting medication within the last 24 hours and in cases of right ventricular infarction. Morphine can be given for further pain relief to patients who continue to report discomfort after nitroglycerin administration. However, reasonable use is not recommended, as it may adversely affect outcomes.[36] All patients with an acute myocardial infarction should be started on a beta blocker, high-intensity statin, aspirin, and a P2Y12 inhibitor as soon as possible, with certain exceptions. Aspirin therapy for ACS begins with a loading dose administered as early as possible, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 to 100 mg once daily.[37] Based on the results from the PLATO (PLATlet inhibition and patient Outcomes) and TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasurgrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38) studies, dual
