of naloxone. A rare but potential side effect of naloxone is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is thought to result from a sudden catecholamine surge, typically following the administration of high doses of naloxone. Treatment involves positive pressure ventilation, starting with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and escalating to endotracheal intubation if necessary.[37] **Inpatient Care** Most patients who overdose on opiates and experience a reversal with naloxone are admitted for observation for at least 12 to 24 hours. Naloxone's duration of action is approximately 1 hour, and long-acting opiates may continue to cause sedation and respiratory depression. These patients are best monitored on a specialized floor. The majority of patients on heroin overdose are admitted due to the risk of acute lung injury, which often presents early. Individuals who are asymptomatic after a heroin overdose may not require 24-hour monitoring but still need 6 to 12 hours of observation before discharge, provided their vital signs remain stable. Admission is also recommended for patients requiring multiple doses or prolonged intravenous infusions of naloxone to maintain respiratory function. Admission is the safest course of action if the patientâ€™s clinical stability is in question. **Outpatient Care** Given the association of opiate use with sudden respiratory difficulty, many healthcare professionals now advocate for take-home naloxone. Having naloxone at home is particularly beneficial for individuals at high risk of narcotic overdose. **Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act** The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act updates federal guidelines to expand access to evidence-based treatments for the opioid epidemic. This act enables all healthcare providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, similar to how they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act aims to reduce the stigma surrounding OUD treatment and promote its integration into general healthcare settings. The MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program as of December 2022. DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority are now permitted to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD within their practice, provided it aligns with applicable state laws. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) encourages providers to take advantage of this change. Practitioners previously registered under the DATA-Waiver program automatically receive updated DEA registration certificates reflecting this change, with no action required on their part. Practitioners are no longer limited in the number of patients with OUD they may treat with buprenorphine. Additionally, separately tracking patients treated with buprenorphine or the number of prescriptions written is
