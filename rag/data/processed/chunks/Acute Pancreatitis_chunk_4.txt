but pancreatitis is still suspected, performing computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast is recommended to establish or rule out the diagnosis. CT is also performed in cases where the patient has failed to improve or worsen despite adequate fluid resuscitation over 48 hours to determine the presence of necrosis (see **Image.** Peripancreatic Necrotic Fluid Shown on CT). The table below summarizes the detailed evaluation of a patient with suspected acute pancreatitis.

As MRCP is non-invasive, there is no perioperative risk, and it does not require contrast but lacks sensitivity for detecting biliary stones less than 3 mm and chronic pancreatitis. For this reason, preference is given to EUS. If MRCP and EUS are unavailable, computed tomography with pancreatic protocol is selected. Diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not routinely done and is reserved for endotherapy for patients with abnormal findings on MRCP/ EUS.[13][14][15] ## Treatment / Management Early aggressive fluid resuscitation is the foundation of management for acute pancreatitis. The choice of fluid is lactated ringers solution given with an initial bolus of 15 to 20 mL/kg and followed by administering at a rate of 3 mL/kg per hour (approximately 250 to 500 mL per hour) in the first 24 hours if there are no other contraindications for fluid. The fluid resuscitation monitoring is done with a combination of labs, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, and urine output every 4 to 6 hours in the first 24 hours of resuscitation to adjust the fluid rate. No response to initial resuscitation indicates a high likelihood of ensuing MODS and is grounds for upgrading the level of care.[16][17][18] A recent RCT concluded that aggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis resulted in a higher incidence of fluid overload without any clinical improvement in the outcomes.[19][20] Another critical issue in managing acute pancreatitis is nutrition. The commonly employed practice is to keep nothing by mouth until abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and ileus improve. Many studies support early feeding in mild pancreatitis and consider it safe as it does not exacerbate symptoms.
