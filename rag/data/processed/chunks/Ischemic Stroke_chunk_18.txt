patients treated with TPA is good, but the outcomes are guarded for those who do not receive thrombolytic medication.[72] Effective communication among all team members is paramount for the rapid diagnosis, decision-making, and implementation of treatment plans. This collaboration facilitates a comprehensive approach to care, from acute management to rehabilitation and secondary prevention. All care decisions should be based on ethical considerations, including informed consent and respect for patient autonomy. The team prioritizes shared decision-making, respecting patient preferences while ensuring beneficence and non-maleficence. An interprofessional healthcare team approach is essential for a timely and effective response, minimizing complications, and prioritizing patient safety and quality of care in managing ischemic stroke. Education and ongoing professional development are essential. They ensure the healthcare team remains knowledgeable about the latest evidence-based practices in stroke care, from acute management to prevention of recurrence. Through dedicated collaboration, the healthcare team will provide patient-centered care from emergency care to rehabilitation, ultimately enhancing outcomes and quality of life for affected patients. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23776&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23776) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/stroke/ischemic-stroke-stroke/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23776) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23776/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23776) [![Axial Section on Noncontrast CT Head Shows Left PCA Ischemic Stroke and No Hemorrhage](/books/NBK499997/bin/3__-__question__image.gif)](/books/NBK499997/figure/article-23776.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK499997/figure/article-23776.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Axial Section on Noncontrast CT Head Shows Left PCA Ischemic Stroke and No Hemorrhage.
