other commonly used and studies rules include CRASH and IMPACT. The CRASH prognosis calculator predicts death at 14 days and death and severe disability at 6 months in adult patients with GCS 14 or less. It does not help determine whether or not a CT is necessary.[39] The IMPACT prognosis calculator predicts a 6-month outcome in adult patients with moderate to severe traumatic intracranial injury. It does not help determine whether or not a CT is necessary.[40] ## Treatment / Management The prime objective in the management of head trauma involves preventing secondary brain insults. The algorithm in the management involves: - Securing airway and maintaining ventilation - Maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure - Preventing hypoxia, hypotension, hypercapnia, or hypocapnia - Evaluating and managing raised ICP - Obtain urgent neurosurgical consultation for traumatic intracranial lesions - Identifying and treating other life-threatening injuries or conditions [41][42][43] **Airway, Breathing, and Circulation** Identify any condition that might compromise the airway, such as a pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pulmonary contusion causing hypoxemia. For sedation, consider using short-acting agents that have a minimal effect on blood pressure or ICP (etomidate or propofol for induction and vecuronium or rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade). Consider endotracheal intubation in the following situations: - Inadequate ventilation or gas exchange, such as hypercarbia, hypoxia, or apnea - Severe head injury - Inability to protect the airway - Severely agitated patient The cervical spine should be maintained in line during intubation. Nasotracheal intubation should be avoided in facial trauma or basilar skull fracture patients. The targets should maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%, PaO2 greater than 60 mm Hg, and PCO2 at 35 to 45 mm Hg. Avoid hypotension. Normal blood pressure may not be adequate to maintain adequate flow and CPP if ICP is elevated. The target is maintaining systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg and MAP greater than 80 mm Hg. Isolated head trauma usually does not cause hypotension. If the patient is in hypovolemic shock, look for another cause. **Mild Head Trauma** Epidemiological data suggests that the majority of head trauma is mild. In this event, many of these patients can be discharged following a routine neurological examination as there is minimal risk of developing intracranial pathology. The utilization of the externally validated head injury trauma rules like the New Orleans Criteria and Canadian CT Head Injury rules can assist in this triage process on who will likely
