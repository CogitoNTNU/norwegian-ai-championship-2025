normal pregnancies. Typically, serum and urine concentrations of hCG rise exponentially during the first trimester of pregnancy, doubling approximately every 24 hours for the first 8 weeks. The peak typically occurs around 10 weeks of gestation, after which levels decrease until approximately week 16, where they remain relatively constant until term.[4] Patients whose hCG levels plateau before 8 weeks of gestation or fail to double commonly have a nonviable pregnancy, whether intrauterine or extrauterine. Extrauterine (ectopic) pregnancies typically exhibit a low rate of rise without the expected doubling. However, given the wide range of normal hCG levels and the variability in its rate of rise, serum hCG testing is often combined with ultrasound evaluation to improve sensitivity and specificity.[21] A threshold of 5000 IU/L has been associated with the need for surgical intervention (>5000 IU/L) versus successful medical intervention (\<5000 IU/L).[22][23] In addition, there has been recent discussion that elevated beta-hCG levels in the second trimester may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and should prompt further investigation.[24] The return of hCG to zero following delivery or termination of pregnancy typically takes between 7 and 60 days.[25] Monitoring the decline in hCG levels is crucial in terminating molar pregnancies and also following the termination of normal or ectopic pregnancies to assure that the therapy has been successful. Notably, many different combinations of antibodies are used in commercial assays. This variety yields heterogeneous results, with a 50-fold difference in immunoassay results.[4] This potential disparity is clinically relevant, particularly when comparing results from different laboratories in different facilities or hospitals when examining low values following pregnancy termination or trophoblastic disease. **Gestational Trophoblastic Disease** Detection of hCG is also helpful in evaluating trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform moles, postmolar tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. All these entities produce hCG, varying levels of which are reported on commercial assays. For example, a total hCG level >100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole, although many normal pregnancies may reach this level at their peak around weeks 8 to 11 of gestation.[26] Precise hCG measurements are crucial for assessing the tumor mass, determining the success of malignancy treatment, and detecting disease recurrence or persistence.[7] **Nonpregnant Patients** hCG in the serum increases with age in nonpregnant women. A cutoff value of 14 mIU/mL has been suggested for use in interpreting results in women older
