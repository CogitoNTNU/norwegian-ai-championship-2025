convulsions while ensuring a safe and optimally timed delivery and closely monitored postpartum care.[3][10] The management of eclampsia should include the following components: - **Initial supportive measures** - **Call for assistance** : Immediate help should be summoned as other trained clinicians are essential to stabilize the patient, evaluate underlying maternal-fetal conditions, and prepare for delivery simultaneously.[10] - **Maternal positioning** : Patients should be placed in the lateral decubitus position to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of aspiration.[2] - **Preventing injury** : Clinicians should ensure the patient's safety by elevating and padding the bed rails. However, restraining the patient during seizures is not advised.[11] - **Airway and oxygenation** : Maintaining a patent airway and preventing aspiration by suctioning secretions are critical. During the seizure, supplemental oxygen administered at 8 to 10 L/min via a face mask is recommended to ensure optimal maternal-fetal oxygenation. Oxygen saturation should continue to be monitored following the seizure to assess for the development of complications, including aspiration and pulmonary edema, which may result in maternal hypoxia and, therefore, necessitate treatment.[2][11] - **Vital signs and laboratory studies** : During and after the seizure, the healthcare team should monitor oxygen saturation, vital signs, urine output, and fluid status closely for at least 72 hours. Following the seizure, laboratory assessments should be performed, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine levels.[2][11] - **Seizure management** - **Magnesium sulfate** : Magnesium sulfate is preferred over other antiseizure treatments for eclamptic seizure prevention. While most seizures are self-limiting, magnesium sulfate is administered primarily to prevent further seizure activity, not to halt the current seizure.[2] The recommended standard loading dose is 6 g intravenous (IV) over 15 to 20 min, followed by a 2 g/hour maintenance dose. In patients without IV access, a loading dose of magnesium sulfate 10 g intramuscularly, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g intramuscularly every 4 hours, may be used as an alternative regimen.[11][2] - In patients with contraindications to magnesium sulfate (eg, myasthenia gravis, hypocalcemia, renal failure, cardiac ischemia, heart block, or myocarditis), alternative antiseizure therapies (eg, phenytoin and diazepam) may be considered.[2] Levetiracetam may be preferable in patients with myasthenia gravis, a condition that may be exacerbated by phenytoin.[18] - **Recurrent seizures** : If convulsions recur, clinicians may consider administering an additional 2 to 4 g of magnesium sulfate over 5 min.[2] If seizures persist after 20 minues, or more than
