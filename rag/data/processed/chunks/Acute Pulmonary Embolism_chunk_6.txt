decreases steadily with age to approximately 10% in patients older than 80. Using age-adjusted cut-offs for patients older than 50 may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in older adults. In one study, using the age-adjusted cut-off instead of the standard D-dimer cut-off of 500 ng/mL or more increased the number of patients in whom the possibility of PE could be ruled out from 6.4% to 30%, without additional false-negative findings.[36] The formula is age (years) x 10 ng/mL for patients older than 50. For example, patient age 75 = age-adjusted d-dimer of 750 ng/mL. **Electrocardiography** Electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities in patients with suspected PE are nonspecific.[37] The most common ECG findings in PE are tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment, T-wave changes, S1Q3T3 pattern, right ventricular strain, and new incomplete right bundle branch block, which are uncommon (see **Image**.\*\*\*\* Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism). **Chest radiograph** In PE, a chest radiograph (CXR) is usually normal or might show nonspecific abnormalities such as atelectasis or effusion. It helps to rule out alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. CXR image may be the first clue toward diagnosing pulmonary infarction (see **Image.** Wedge-Shaped Pulmonary Infarction). A "Hampton hump" (wedge-shaped consolidation at the lung periphery), Westermark sign (radiographic oligemia or increased lucency), and Fleischer sign (prominent pulmonary artery) are specific findings but lack sensitivity to be diagnostically sufficient. A sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82%, respectively, with Hampton hump, have been quoted in the literature (see **Image.** Hampton Hump).[38] Other features, such as atelectasis or focal consolidation, may be present but are neither sensitive nor specific.[39] The Westermark sign is the sharp cut-off of pulmonary vessels with distal hypoperfusion in a segmental distribution within the lung; these findings are rare but specific to acute PE.[39] Westermark sign may be seen in up to 2% of the cases, resulting from a combination of dilation of the pulmonary artery proximal to the thrombus and the collapse of the distal vasculature. **Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** Multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the diagnostic modality of choice for patients with suspected PE. CTPA allows appropriate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level.[40] The PIOPED (Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis) II study showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for CTPA in PE diagnosis.[41] Moreover, CTPA is the most commonly used imaging technique to diagnose pulmonary infarction in combination with appropriate
