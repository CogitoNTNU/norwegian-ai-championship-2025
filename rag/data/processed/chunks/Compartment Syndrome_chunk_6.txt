and more extended hospital stays are also common in these patients. ## Complications ACS complications include the following: - Renal failure - Bowel ischemia - Respiratory distress or failure - Increased cranial pressure - Cardiac failure - Potential death ## Deterrence and Patient Education The keys to preventing ACS development are, first and foremost, to measure IAP in any patient with risk factors, especially ICU patients. Other practices to minimize IAH are judicious use of IV fluids and blood products; avoiding a significantly positive fluid balance; using low tidal volumes in mechanical ventilation; using intestinal prokinetic medications to avoid ileus or constipation; and minimizing enteral feedings. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of ACS require an interprofessional team approach. The condition can present subtly, and the diagnosis can easily be missed. ACS is very common in medical and surgical ICUs, with many studies showing an IAH prevalence of 30% to 40%. One survey of specialists found that non-surgical specialists were comparatively less familiar with recognizing, diagnosing, and managing ACS than surgical specialists.[21][30] Ideally, monitoring all critically ill patients for ACS should be established as a routine practice among institutions; however, monitoring may be limited due to a lack of understanding or limited resources.[14] Overall, the outcomes for some patients with ACS can be poor due to effects on multiple organ systems and underlying comorbidities. However, those diagnosed and treated promptly with the involvement of the appropriate specialties have improved outcomes, and early treatment of ACS minimizes end-organ damage.[17] Thus, it is essential to involve general surgeons in caring for patients at high risk of developing or currently having an acute abdomen. Surgeons can assist with the workup management and monitor the patient in case the patient requires surgery. Patients with ACS should be closely monitored in the ICU with intensivists familiar with the disease process. Pharmacists play a crucial role in enhancing pain management and sedation by identifying suitable medications for patients. Nurses must monitor vital signs, abdominal girth, wound care, and urine output. Critical team members include nutritionists, physical and occupational therapists, and respiratory therapists. Patients who develop ACS and need surgical intervention have a prolonged recovery and require long-term care. This further emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient treatment in ACS. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19771&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19771) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/procedures/abdominal-compartment-syndrome/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19771) - [Comment
