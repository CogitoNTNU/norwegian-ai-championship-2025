neurologic deficits, non-reactive pupils, bradycardia), interventions to maintain cerebral perfusion include: - Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees - Inducing mild hyperventilation in the intubated patient - Osmotic diuretics such as 25% mannitol or 3% saline **Chemoprophylaxis** Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for close contacts of a patient diagnosed with _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ type B meningitis. Close contacts include housemates, significant others, those who have shared utensils, and health care providers in proximity to secretions (providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubating without a facemask). Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for _N. meningitidis_ includes rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, and for _H. influenzae_ type B: rifampin. ## Differential Diagnosis - Stroke - Subdural hematoma - Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Metastatic brain disease - Brain abscess (might coexist with meningitis) ## Prognosis Outcomes depend on patient characteristics such as age and immune status, but also vary depending on the etiologic organism. In the United States, for overall bacterial meningitis, the annual case fatality rate in 2010 was 14.3%. Pathogen-specific mortality:[6] - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 17.9% - _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 10.1% - Group B _Streptococcus_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 11.1% - _H._ i _nfluenzae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 7% - _Listeria monocytogenes_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 18.1% ## Complications A metaanalysis published in 2010 from a cohort of pediatric patients reported that the median risk of sequelae post-discharge was 19.9%. In this study, the most common organism isolated was _H. influenzae_ , followed by _S. pneumoniae_. The most common sequelae were hearing loss (6%), followed by behavioral (2.6%) and cognitive difficulties (2.2%), motor deficit (2.3%), seizure disorder (1.6%) and visual impairment (0.9%). [17] Other complications include: - Increased intracranial pressure from cerebral edema caused by increased intracellular fluid in the brain. Several factors are involved in the development of cerebral edema: increased in blood-brain barrier permeability, cytotoxicity from cytokines, immune cells, and bacteria. - Hydrocephalus - Cerebrovascular complications - Focal neurologic deficits ## Consultations - Infectious diseases specialist in case of unidentified or rare pathogen - Neurology to aid in seizure management - Neurosurgery when there is suspicion of progression to brain abscess - Rheumatology and heme/oncology in case of non-infectious cause ## Pearls and Other Issues Differentiating between bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis may be difficult. CSF analysis may not be conclusive, and cultures do not immediately yield an answer. Multiplex and specific PCR panels are available and provide information
