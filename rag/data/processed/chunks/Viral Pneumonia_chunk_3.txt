dyscrasias. \_**Human herpesvirus 6 and 7** \_ - DNA \_**Herpes simplex virus** \_ - DNA - HSV I and II are both associated with viral pneumonia in immune-compromised patients, including those with HIV, solid organ transplantation, and hematopoietic transplantation. \_**Minimi virus** _ \_**Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** \_ - DNA - CMV is a significant cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count less than 100 cells per millimeter squared. - CMV is also frequently implicated in pneumonia in recipients of solid organ transplant and hematopoietic transplant. \_**Measles** \_ - RNA - A childhood exanthemataâ€™s illness that, although less common in the industrialized world secondary to vaccination, remains a major contributor to worldwide childhood mortality secondary to viral pneumonia as a sequela. \*\*_Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Coronavirus)_ \*\* - RNA - A subset of the coronavirus associated with severe pneumonia. This was first observed in the Middle East and had an initial mortality rate of 30%. \_**Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Metapneumovirus)** \_ - RNA - A subset of Coronavirus causing life-threatening pneumonia ## Epidemiology A number of epidemiological cues can aid in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, including the following: **Age** - Viral pneumonia is most common in the very young and in the elderly. There is a steep decline in the incidence of viral pneumonia from adolescence through the fifth or sixth decade of life. Then an upsurge as age-related immunosuppression and age-related pathologies result in immunosuppression increase.[7][8][9] **Pregnancy** - Viral pneumonia continues to be quite concerning in pregnancy. Of particular concern is influenza-related pneumonia secondary to the ubiquitous nature of influenza from late fall to late spring; the last two major flu epidemics, 1918 and 1957, produced respective mortality rates of 50% and 10%. This increased mortality is a major factor in the CDC recommendation that all otherwise healthy women receive an inactivated influenza virus vaccine during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An additional, though less common, cause of viral pneumonia in pregnant women is varicella. Limited data reflects a very substantial mortality rate, and current recommendations are for treatment with varicella-zoster immune globulin within 96 hours of exposure to varicella in a non-immune gravid female. **Immune competence** - Decreased immune competence can be a result of the following: - Chemotherapy (and/or) radiation therapy for neoplasm - Treatment of chronic inflammatory illness with immunosuppressive therapy - Organ transplantation requiring immunosuppressive medications - Acquired immune incompetence secondary to
