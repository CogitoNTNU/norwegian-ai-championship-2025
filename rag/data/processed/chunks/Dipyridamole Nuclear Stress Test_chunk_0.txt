It is also used in the evaluation of coronary artery disease during a pharmacologic stress test. This activity illustrates the indications, action, and contraindications for dipyridamole as a valuable agent in preventing thromboembolic events in those with mechanical valves and the importance of use for pharmacologic stress testing. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to members of the interprofessional team. **Objectives:** - Identify the mechanism of action for the administration of dipyridamole. - Describe the possible adverse effects of dipyridamole. - Review the appropriate monitoring for patients using dipyridamole. - Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication, especially in the administration of pharmacologic stress testing to improve outcomes and reduce adverse events.

It is also a vasodilator that is FDA-approved for use as an adjunctive agent in thromboembolism prophylaxis in those undergoing cardiac valve replacement and thallium-nuclear stress testing. It is also used off-label to prevent stroke; however, it is not FDA approved for this indication. In addition to its use as a sole agent, the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole also has clinical use. This formulation obtained FDA approval for stroke prevention and as an alternative therapy for those with intolerable headaches. Off-labels for the combination medication include those with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and maintaining hemodialysis graft patency.[1][2][3] **Stroke Prevention** The indication for stroke prevention came from the data obtained from the European Stroke Prevention Study 2 Trial (ESPS-2).[4] This randomized control trial evaluated the stroke risk reduction amongst patients with recent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or ischemic strokes. The patients meeting inclusion criteria were categorized into four distinct treatment groups that included placebo treatment, aspirin 25mg twice daily, 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole twice daily, and a combination of dipyridamole with aspirin 25mg twice daily. The study concluded that the group that received the combination
