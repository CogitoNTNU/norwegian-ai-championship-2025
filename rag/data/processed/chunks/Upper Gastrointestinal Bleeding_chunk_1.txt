ulceration; can be at any location along the GI tract[1] - Gastric antral valvular ectasia (GAVE; also known as watermelon stomach) - Mallory-Weiss tears - Cameron lesions (bleeding ulcers occurring at the site of a hiatal hernia[2] - Aortoenteric fistulas - Foreign body ingestion - Post-surgical bleeds (post-anastomotic bleeding, post-polypectomy bleeding, post-sphincterotomy bleeding) - Upper GI tumors - Hemobilia (bleeding from the biliary tract) - Hemosuccus pancreaticus (bleeding from the pancreatic duct) **Lower GI Bleeding** - Diverticulosis (colonic wall protrusion at the site of penetrating vessels; over time mucosa overlying the vessel can be injured and rupture leading to bleeding) [diverticulosis] - Angiodysplasia - Infectious colitis - Ischemic colitis - Inflammatory bowel disease - Colon cancer - Hemorrhoids - Anal fissures - Rectal varices - Dieulafoy lesion (more rarely found outside of the stomach, but can be found throughout GI tract) - Radiation-induced damage following treatment of abdominal or pelvic cancers - Post-surgical (post-polypectomy bleeding, post-biopsy bleeding) ## Epidemiology Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is more common than lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).[3][4][5][6] The incidence of UGIB is approximately 67/100,000 population while that of LGIB is approximately 36/100,000 population. LGIB is more common in men than women because vascular diseases and diverticulosis are more common in men.[7] The incidence increases with age. The overall incidence is decreasing nationwide. ## History and Physical **History** Question patient for potential clues regarding: - Previous episodes of GI bleeding - Past medical history relevant to potential bleeding sources (e.g., varices, portal hypertension, alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse, ulcers, H.pylori, diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease) - Comorbid conditions that could affect management - Contributory or confounding medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, bismuth, iron) - Symptoms associated with bleeding (e.g., painless vs. painful, trouble swallowing, unintentional weight loss, preceding emesis or retching, change in bowel habits) **Physical** - Look for signs of hemodynamic instability: - Resting tachycardia — associated with the loss of less than 15% total blood volume - Orthostatic hypotension — carries an association with the loss of approximately 15% total blood volume - Supine hypotension — associated with the loss of approximately 40% total blood volume - Abdominal pain may raise suspicion for perforation or ischemia. - A rectal exam is important for the evaluation of: - Anal fissures - Hemorrhoids - Anorectal mass - Stool exam ## Evaluation The following laboratory tests are advised to assist in finding the cause of GI bleeding.
