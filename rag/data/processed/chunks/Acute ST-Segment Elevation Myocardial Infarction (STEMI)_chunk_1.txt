requires confirming the presence of ischemic myocardial injury with abnormal cardiac biomarker levels.[2] STEMI is a clinical syndrome involving myocardial ischemia, electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and chest pain (see **Image.** Electrocardiogram Tracing for a Case of Proximal Left Anterior Descending Occlusion). If electrocardiography indicates STEMI, prompt reperfusion through primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 120 minutes can lower mortality from 9% to 7% (see **Image**. ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction on Electrocardiogram).[3] In cases where PCI within this timeframe is not feasible, full-dose fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase should be administered to patients younger than 75 and without contraindications to medical intervention. Individuals 75 and older should receive half the normal dose of fibrinolytic therapy. Alternatively, full-dose streptokinase may be considered when cost is a concern. Following fibrinolytic treatment, patients should be transferred to a facility capable of performing PCI within the next 24 hours. ## Etiology Myocardial infarction, in general, can be classified into types 1 to 5 based on etiology and pathogenesis.[4] Recent advances in cardiovascular imaging, revised ECG criteria, and high-sensitivity cardiovascular biomarker assays have enhanced the ability to classify the different causes of myocardial infarction more precisely. The underlying pathophysiology of type 1 myocardial infarction differs from that of types 2 through 5. Type 1 myocardial infarction is primarily associated with intracoronary atherothrombosis, whereas the other types may result from various mechanisms, some of which may involve an atherosclerotic component. Type 2 myocardial infarction is characterized by an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis. Types 1 and 2 occur spontaneously, while types 4 and 5 are linked to medical procedures. Type 3 is only identified postmortem. Most types 1 and 2 myocardial infarction cases present as NSTEMI, but some manifest as STEMI (see **Image**. Acute Myocardial Infarction Types).[5] A STEMI occurs from the occlusion of 1 or more coronary arteries supplying the heart with blood. The cause of this abrupt disruption of blood flow is usually plaque rupture, erosion, fissuring, or dissection of coronary arteries with obstructive thrombus. The major STEMI risk factors are dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and a family history of coronary artery disease.[6][7] ## Epidemiology Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with low- and middle-resource countries experiencing a disproportionate share of this burden. ACS frequently serves as the initial presentation of CVD. Approximately 5.8 million new cases of ischemic heart disease
