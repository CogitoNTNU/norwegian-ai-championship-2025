still be beneficial for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to improve nutrient absorption and digestion **Endoscopic management:** A celiac plexus block, involving the injection of a local anesthetic (typically bupivacaine), sometimes combined with a corticosteroid (typically triamcinolone), can be performed endoscopically using EUS or with CT guidance by a radiologist.[32] Pain relief from this procedure typically lasts 3 to 6 months and can be repeated as needed. Obstructing pancreatic stones can be extracted using a basket, whereas balloons are rarely effective except in children, who may have softer stones. If traditional extraction methods fail, ESWL, pancreatoscopy-assisted laser, or electrohydraulic lithotripsy may be considered, particularly when a guidewire cannot be advanced past the stone(s). For main pancreatic duct dilation, ERCP can help decompress ductal obstruction through pancreatic sphincterotomy, stone extraction, stricture dilatation, or stent placement, depending on diagnostic pancreatographic findings. However, when chronic pancreatitis is advanced enough to cause steatorrhea, ductal decompression via dilatation, stenting, or stone extraction offers limited benefit. During ERCP, ductal cytologic brushing can also be performed to evaluate for malignancy. Pancreatic duct leaks may be treated with the temporary placement of a plastic stent to facilitate healing. Endoscopic drainage into the gastrointestinal tract, typically the stomach, can be performed using 1 or more lumen-apposing metal stents for peri-gastric pancreatic fluid collections such as pseudocysts or necrosis.[33] **Surgical management:** Surgical decompression is preferred over ERCP when the main pancreatic duct is narrowed. Several surgical procedures are available based on the disease's location and severity: - Puestow procedure (most commonly performed): Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy combined with a Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy to improve drainage. - Beger procedure: Duodenal-preserving pancreatic head resection with a Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy, used for pancreatic head-dominant chronic pancreatitis. - Frey procedure: A modification of the Puestow procedure that involves lateral pancreaticojejunostomy draining the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Unlike the Beger procedure, it preserves the pancreatic neck while removing part of the overlying pancreatic head. - Distal pancreatectomy: Typically performed laparoscopically for tail-predominant disease. However, complications such as pancreatic fistulae and endocrine failure are relatively common.[34] - Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant: Reserved for patients with refractory pain who have failed all other treatments. Although once used selectively, its application has been increasing in recent years.[35] Additional surgical indications for chronic pancreatitis include: - Pancreatic abscess, fistula, or pseudocyst when endoscopic management fails - Pancreatic ascites - Stenosis of the duodenum leading to gastric outlet obstruction - Gastric variceal
