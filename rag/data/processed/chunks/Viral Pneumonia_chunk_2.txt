this is a bit of an artificial division, a more meaningful approach to etiology is to define by clinical syndromes produced and demographics affected.[4][5][6] **Etiologies of Viral Influenza** \_**Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)** \_ - RNA virus - RSV is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in small children and infants. \_**Rhinovirus** \_ - RNA - Rhinovirus is the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infection across all age groups, although it is not as commonly represented as a cause of viral pneumonia. \_**Influenza A, B and C viruses** \_ - RNA - Influenza A is the greatest cause of mortality and morbidity among the viral types of pneumonia. - There are multiple subtypes of Influenza A. Two particularly concerning subtypes to be aware of are the avian flu (H5N1)and swine flu (H1N1). \_**Human metapneumovirus** \_ - RNA - Human Metapneumovirus is a novel viral pathogen that is increasingly recognized as a cause of viral pneumonia and is implicated as the cause of the SARS outbreak. **Parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3, and 4** - RNA - Parainfluenza virus has multiple serotypes and is most commonly associated with pneumonia-like illness in young children seasonally. Spring and fall predominate. \_**Human bocavirus** _ \_**Coronavirus** \_ - RNA - Coronal viruses are already viruses that cause pneumonia, typically in immune incompetent people. - However, one subtype of coronavirus is the virus causing Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, and another has been implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome. \_**Adenovirus** \_ - DNA - Adenovirus most commonly causes pneumonia in people with solid organ transplantation or hematological transplantation \_**Enteroviruses** \_ - RNA - Enteroviruses, although common causes of polio, gastrointestinal, and upper respiratory tract syndromes, are less common causes of viral pneumonia. \_**Varicella-zoster virus** \_ - DNA - Varicella-zoster virus is associated with both chickenpox and shingles and may cause severe types of pneumonia, particularly in non-immune pregnant women, non-gravid-adults with chickenpox. It is a fairly common cause of pneumonia in people with HIV post-shingles outbreak \_**Hantavirus** \_ - RNA - Hantavirus is a zoonotic viral pathogen that emerged in the American Southwest and is associated with rodent feces exposure. - Hantavirus pneumonia is associated with frequent rapid respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. \_**Parechoviruses** _ **_Epstein-Barr_ _virus (EBV)_** - DNA - Epstein-Barr virus, although commonly implicated in mono-like syndromes, can be rarely associated with viral pneumonia. The majority of which occur in people with hematological
