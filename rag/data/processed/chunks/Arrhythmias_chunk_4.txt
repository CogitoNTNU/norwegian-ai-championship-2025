Arrhythmia originating from or near the AV node. Mechanism: Rhythm arising from the AV node. Risk Factors: Post cardiac surgery, myocardial ischemia (or during reperfusion), or digoxin toxicity. Signs & Symptoms: Usually well-tolerated and asymptomatic. EKG Findings: Inverted P Wave in the lead 2 with short PR or No P waves with a narrow complex. Management: Treat the underlying cause. \*\*\*\* IV.**Ventricular Tachycardia:** Origin is below the AV node. It is the major cause of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States. a) Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia:[8]\*\*\*\* When the rapid ventricular rhythm terminates on its own within 30 seconds. Mechanism: Channelopathies secondary to structural abnormality, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic imbalance, and the effect of pro-arrhythmic drugs. Risk Factors: Structural or ischemic heart disease. Signs & Symptoms: Asymptomatic or palpitations. EKG Findings: Monomorphic wide complex with more than three beats in a row but lasts less than three seconds. Management: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and/or medical therapy. b) Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia Mechanism: Presence of damaged fibers in ischemic heart disease leading to re-entry of current. Some patients do not have structural heart disease. Approximately 10% of the cases are idiopathic. Risk Factors: Structural heart disease and post-myocardial infarction. Signs & Symptoms: Palpitation, hypotension, or syncope. EKG Findings: Monomorphic wide complex tachycardia. Management: Intravenous lidocaine, amiodarone, or procainamide. Catheter ablation is an option too. c) Ventricular Fibrillation Mechanism: Presence of damaged fibers in ischemic heart disease leading to re-entry of current leading to disorganized high-frequency excitation. Patients with Cardiomyopathies can have Ventricular fibrillation due to an increase in end-diastolic pressure, wall tension, or the presence of abnormal channels in ventricular fibers. Risk Factors: Structural heart disease and post-myocardial infarction. Signs & Symptoms: Syncope and death if not treated immediately. EKG Findings: Polymorphic fibrillatory waves. Management: Unsynchronized cardioversion followed by amiodarone. d) Torsades De Pointes: Mechanism: It is usually precipitated by premature ventricular contraction leading to the “R on T phenomenon.” Risk Factors: Congenital long QTc with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Signs & Symptoms: Syncope and death if not treated immediately. EKG Findings: Polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia with a heart rate > 300 bpm. Management: Intravenous magnesium or Isoproterenol, which increases heart rate and decreases QT-duration. Avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Chronic therapy with beta-blockers in patients with long QT syndrome. **Bradyarrhythmias:** [9] [10] Bradyarrhythmia is defined as a heart rate below 60 beats per minute (bpm) and comprises several rhythm disorders, including atrioventricular (A-V) blocks and sinus node
