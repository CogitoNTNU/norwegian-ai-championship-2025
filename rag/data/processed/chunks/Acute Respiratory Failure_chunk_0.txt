The differential diagnosis is broad, including infections, inflammatory processes, vascular occlusion, aortic dissection, bowel obstruction, undiagnosed tumors, or a ruptured viscous. Patients often present with sudden abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, or distension. A thorough history and physical examination, including vital signs and an abdominal assessment, are essential. Signs of peritonitis, shock, or obstruction necessitate urgent evaluation. Clinicians should tailor further diagnostic testing based on clinical presentation while providing appropriate analgesia. This activity for healthcare professionals enhances the learner's understanding of evaluating and managing patients presenting with an acute abdomen. They will learn to differentiate between benign and life-threatening conditions, refine their clinical decision-making skills, and implement evidence-based strategies for imaging utilization. The activity will emphasize the importance of thorough history-taking and physical examination, appropriate use of ultrasound and computed tomography scans, and recognizing critical findings that necessitate urgent intervention. Participants will gain a deeper insight into the condition's clinical manifestations, diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic interventions. Clinicians can optimize patient care, mitigate unnecessary testing, ensure timely and appropriate specialty referrals, improve patient safety, and enhance healthcare outcomes by properly evaluating patients with an acute abdomen. Greater proficiency increases the learner's ability to collaborate within an interprofessional team caring for patients with acute abdominal pain. **Objectives:** - Identify key signs and symptoms indicative of an acute abdomen to facilitate early diagnosis. - Differentiate between various causes of acute abdomen, such as surgical and nonsurgical conditions. - Implement evidence-based treatment protocols tailored to the underlying cause of acute abdomen. - Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to ensure comprehensive patient care and follow-up care plans to monitor recovery and prevent complications.

Although the underlying cause is often benign, serious underlying pathology may also be present, and clinicians must be able to recognize
