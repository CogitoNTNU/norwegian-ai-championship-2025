performance. Identifying patients at high risk for aspiration and implementing strict aspiration precautions is crucial, as inhalation of oropharyngeal contents is a significant risk factor for developing lung abscesses. Physicians and advanced practitioners play a pivotal role in diagnosing and treating aspiration pneumonia promptly to prevent progression to lung abscesses. Nurses are vital in recognizing and communicating the need for increased monitoring of patients with restricted mobility, including those with cerebral vascular accidents, severe Parkinson's disease, severe Alzheimer's disease, or postoperative status, who are at higher risk for aspiration. Pharmacists contribute by ensuring appropriate antibiotic regimens are administered, considering potential drug interactions and contraindications, especially in complex cases involving broad-spectrum antibiotics or patients with a history of healthcare exposure requiring MRSA coverage. Physical therapists and respiratory therapists provide essential chest physiotherapy and physical therapy to prevent bedbound status and respiratory muscle fatigue, thereby reducing the risk of aspiration. Interprofessional communication and care coordination are essential for the timely recognition and management of lung abscesses. This involves regular team meetings, shared electronic health records for real-time information exchange, and collaborative decision-making to adjust treatment plans based on patient responses. Diagnostic tools such as chest radiographs, CT scans, sputum examination, and bronchoscopy require input from radiologists and pulmonologists to guide accurate diagnosis and treatment. In complex cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, requiring coordination with thoracic surgeons. Vigilant monitoring and early intervention can prevent complications such as pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema in immunocompromised patients. By integrating the expertise and skills of various healthcare professionals, the team can ensure comprehensive care, improve clinical outcomes, and maintain patient safety throughout the treatment of lung abscesses. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=24485&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=24485) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/infectious-disease/lung-abscess/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=24485) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/24485/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=24485) [![Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess](/books/NBK555920/bin/Lung_abscess_-_CT_scan_x7471756882x.gif)](/books/NBK555920/figure/article-24485.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK555920/figure/article-24485.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess.
