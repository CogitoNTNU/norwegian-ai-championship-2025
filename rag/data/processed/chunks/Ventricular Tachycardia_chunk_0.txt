This condition is characterized by atrial and/or ventricular rates exceeding 100 beats per minute (bpm) in adults and over 200 bpm in children.[1] The most common SVT subtypes in adults include atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Other common subtypes, which will be the focus of this activity, include atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial tachycardia. In contrast, junctional tachycardia is encountered less frequently. SVTs have a moderate prevalence, occurring at a rate of 2.25 cases per 1000 adults, and with an estimated incidence of 0.1% to 0.4% in the pediatric population.[2][3] Since the introduction of catheter ablation, the tools and technologies for this procedure have continued to advance and expand. Despite these innovations, successful management fundamentally depends on achieving an accurate diagnosis. This activity focuses on the methods used to differentiate SVT in the electrophysiology laboratories. ## Anatomy and Physiology The normal cardiac conduction system initiates with an electrical impulse generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node. This impulse then travels through the His-Purkinje system, which functions as an electrical highway, facilitating the depolarization of the heart. SVT can occur from various conduction abnormalities, such as dual pathways within the atrioventricular (AV) node, as seen in AVNRT, or from the presence of accessory pathways. Accessory pathways are bundles of muscle with electrical properties that connect the atria and ventricles. They may be located near the His-Purkinje system or more remotely, forming macroreentrant circuits.[4] Specifically, accessory AV pathways traverse through the fibrofatty tissue of the AV groove (sulcus tissue) and the fibrous annulus (hinge lines) of the heart valves.[5] These pathways are believed to result from incomplete fusion between the sulcus and cushion tissues during embryonic development.[6] ## Indications The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines categorize recommendations into 3 main categories, as outlined below: - Class I - Strongly recommended based on solid evidence - Class II - This class is divided into 2 subcategories: - IIa - Benefits outweigh
