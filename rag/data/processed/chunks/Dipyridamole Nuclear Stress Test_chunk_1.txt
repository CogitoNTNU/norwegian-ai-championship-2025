of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole showed a reduced risk of stroke compared to the placebo group. Further, the combination treatment arm revealed the most significant stroke risk reduction with an odds ratio of 0.59 compared to aspirin (OR=0.79) and extended-release dipyridamole (OR=0.81). Further, a 2005 meta-analysis performed by Leonardi-Bee et al. compiled data from pertaining randomized control trials that found that dipyridamole use alone reduced the risk of future stroke events compared to control arms.[5] The exact impact of this study is under dispute as 59% of the data collected from this metanalysis was derived from the ESPS-2 trial, and without it, did not obtain statistical significance. Further, a 2009 study in the New England Journal of Medicine compared the combination of extended-release dipyridamole with aspirin (ASA-ERDP) against clopidogrel for the risk of recurrent stroke.[6] This double-blinded study compared recurrent stroke risk in those taking 25 mg aspirin-200 mg dipyridamole twice daily versus 75 mg clopidogrel daily. The study's conclusion revealed similar results for the primary outcome of stroke recurrence, 8.8% of the clopidogrel group versus 9.0% in the ASA-ERDP group; this elucidated that neither treatment group was superior for reduction of stroke recurrence in comparison to each other. **Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Cardiac Valve Replacement, Adjunct with Warfarin** A 1994 metanalysis by Pouleur et al. demonstrated the value of dipyridamole in mechanical cardiac valve replacement by reducing the frequency and risk of embolization.[7] This study included randomized control trials totaling 1141 patients. The data revealed a significant risk reduction for both fatal and non-fatal thromboembolic events when anticoagulation was combined with dipyridamole compared to anticoagulation alone. The decrease in total events, both fatal and non-fatal, demonstrated a 56% reduction, while fatal events showed a reduction of 64%. Overall, this study revealed the significant impact that dipyridamole plays in reducing thromboembolic disease after mechanical cardiac valve replacement.[7] Additionally, a randomized control trial performed previously in 1983 compared using warfarin with either aspirin, dipyridamole, or alone to evaluate the risk of adverse bleeding events in those who underwent mechanical valve replacement. The study concluded that the use of dipyridamole in place of aspirin resulted in a 10% reduction of risk for adverse bleeding events when combined with warfarin.[8] **Role in Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (off label-use)** Myocardial perfusion imaging is a form of assessing blood flow to the heart and evaluating coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole was the first agent employed for pharmacologic
