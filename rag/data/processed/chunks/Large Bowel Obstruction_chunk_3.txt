until arterial inflow is compromised. This process progresses from reversible to irreversible ischemia and necrosis, ultimately leading to perforation. The cecum has the largest diameter and thinnest wall and is thus at greatest risk of perforation. When the colon is obstructed and distended, its motility is disrupted, leading to bacterial overgrowth. Mucosal edema and ischemia lead to the breakdown of the mucosal barrier, resulting in bacterial translocation of the gut flora and fecalization of the small bowel, increasing the risk of bacteremia and sepsis.[1][12] Pseudo-obstruction is attributed to excessive sympathetic stimulation within the colon due to a disruption of parasympathetic activity, further exacerbated by the direct stimulation of mechanoreceptors, resulting in decreased motility. Factors contributing to the incidence of volvulus include poor or absent peritoneal fixation of the colon, a longer or redundant colon segment, and thinning of the colonic mesentery in the setting of dysmotility secondary to causes such as chronic constipation or use of laxatives.[1][12][14][20] ## History and Physical The clinical features of large bowel obstruction depend on the etiology and the anatomical site of the obstruction. In general, patients may present with pain, abdominal distention, minimal or absent flatus or bowel movements, and nausea and vomiting. Patients with an incompetent ileocecal valve decompress their large bowel into the small bowel, eventually leading to vomiting. However, patients with a competent ileocecal valve have ongoing distension of the obstructed colon and often develop progressive right iliac fossa pain, signifying impending cecal perforation. A rectal examination may reveal a vault empty of stool, a mass, or blood.[21] **Clinical Features of Colorectal Malignancyâ€“Associated Obstruction** Obstruction caused by underlying colorectal malignancy commonly occurs in the descending or sigmoid colon and rectum, where the diameter of the colon is smaller and the stool is more solid. Individuals may experience changes in bowel habits leading up to an obstruction, possibly an alternating pattern between diarrhea and constipation, as only liquefied content may pass through the narrowed lumen. Symptoms may be present for weeks or months before an acute presentation and may include rectal bleeding and weight loss, but an obstruction may also present abruptly. Patients may or may not have a family history of colorectal cancer.[21][22] **Clinical Features of Volvulus-Associated Obstruction** Sigmoid volvulus is common in individuals with limited mobility and a history of constipation, such as those who are bedbound and more sedentary residents of congregate care facilities. A volvulus typically presents more
