typically occurs through host-environmental interactions, particularly with stagnant freshwater and artificial water systems.[31] Contaminated drinking water, humidifiers, nebulizers, ventilation, and cooling systems have all been linked with cases of legionellosis.[32][33][34] The incubation period can range anywhere from 2 to 10 days.[35] Males are more affected than females, and older age groups, immunosuppression, and cigarette smoking all appear to be independently associated with legionellosis. _L. pneumophila_ has been recorded in 1% to 3% of all community-acquired pneumonia cases and contributes up to 26% of all atypical pneumonia, but it may also be asymptomatic in some cases.[36] In a larger population survey, _L. longbeachae_ was found in only 5% of 556 community-acquired pneumonia cases in Thailand.[37] Prevalence tends to be higher in younger age groups, and mortality is lower than for _L. pneumophila_ cases.[38] _L. longbeachae_ is typically associated with natural soil mixtures within hot and humid potting environments. Inoculation is thought to occur through inhaled exposure to contaminated potting mix and poor hygiene while gardening or landscaping.[39] Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Mycoplasma Pneumonia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27362)", "[Chlamydia Pneumonia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19432)," and "[Legionnaires Disease](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24176)" for further information. ## Pathophysiology Atypical bacteria that cause pneumonia are often obligate intracellular organisms, making them difficult to culture and identify on Gram stain.[1] _M. pneumoniae_ ,_C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species are typically gram-negative bacteria, but each has unique virulence factors and characteristics that allow them to survive in hostile environments, including against host defenses. These bacteria are acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets, and, except _Legionella_ species, are transmitted from human to human.[34][33][34] When the inoculating bacteria overwhelm the host defenses, it causes a proliferation of the infectious agent. The pathogen replication triggers the host immune response, leading to inflammation, alveolar irritation, and impairment.[40] These immune responses result in the following signs and symptomsâ€”cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia.[41]\*\*\*\* Atypical bacterial pneumonia infections result in less lobar consolidation and are more likely to be associated with interstitial and bronchopneumonia radiological changes on imaging.[42] Therefore, many patients have subacute presentations and do not appear toxic in these cases; hence, the common term _walking pneumonia_ is typically associated with _M. pneumoniae._ However, this can be a misnomer, as _M. pneumoniae_ can still progress to shock and mechanical ventilation.[43] Due to their intracellular nature, these infections are often challenging to treat because antibiotics must be able to penetrate intracellularly to reach their intended target. ## History and Physical Patients often
