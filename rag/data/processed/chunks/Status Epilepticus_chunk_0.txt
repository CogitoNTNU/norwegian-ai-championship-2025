The condition typically affects children between the ages of 2 and 12, with a peak incidence between 3 and 5 years. ESES is associated with various etiologies, which may or may not involve structural brain abnormalities. Clinically, affected children often present with infrequent seizures, either focal or generalized, and experience stagnation or regression in their developmental progress. The current treatment approach includes the use of traditional antiepileptic drugs, such as benzodiazepines and corticosteroids, as well as other therapies like epilepsy surgery, intravenous immunoglobulin, and the ketogenic diet. Participants in this activity gain a comprehensive understanding of the evaluation and management of ESES. They learn about the critical importance of early diagnosis and intervention to prevent long-term cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for affected children. The activity emphasizes the value of an interprofessional team approach in managing ESES, where collaboration among neurologists, pediatricians, neuropsychologists, and other healthcare professionals enhances patient outcomes. By integrating knowledge from various specialties, the healthcare team can develop individualized treatment plans that address both the seizure control and cognitive development of the patient, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify the early signs and symptoms of electrical status epilepticus in sleep in patients to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. - Assess the effectiveness of treatment plans for patients with electrical status epilepticus in sleep, and adjust them as necessary to optimize patient outcomes. - Implement evidence-based treatment strategies, including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, for managing electrical status epilepticus in sleep. - Collaborate with an interprofessional team to create and execute individualized treatment plans for children with electrical status epilepticus in sleep.
