Numerous studies have shown that early institution of inhaled corticosteroids can reduce exacerbations and decrease the frequency of associated hospital admissions. This activity outlines the diagnosis, management and treatment of environmental and allergic asthma and describes how to prevent exacerbations of it. It highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in helping educate patients about compliance with treatment and prevention of exacerbations by identifying the triggers. **Objectives:** - Summarize the pathophysiology behind allergic and environmentally induced asthma. - Explain the common physical exam findings associated with asthma. - Outline the goals for management of environmental and allergic asthma. - Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care and help prevent asthma exacerbations.

Many cells including mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and epithelial cells contribute to the inflammation that occurs. The inflammation can lead to the symptoms of asthma that arise; such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. Asthma is an obstructive airway disorder, limiting expiratory airflow. It is both acute and reversible and is characterized by obstruction of airflow due to inflammation, bronchospasm and increased airway secretions. Asthma is a disease that impacts all races, ages, sexes, and ethnic groups. It is estimated that 7% of Americans have asthma. Asthma and atopy have dramatically increased in westernized countries. Despite the high prevalence of disease there have been improved outcomes and fewer hospitalizations for asthma attacks. Asthma is characterized by episodic wheezing, hyperresponsiveness of airways to various stimuli and obstruction of airways. These symptoms may occur a few times a day or a few times a week, depending on the person. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel guidelines for the management of asthma recommend that patients who require daily asthma medications have allergy testing for perennial indoor and outdoor allergens. ## Etiology The etiology of asthma can be multifactorial. It is thought to be a
