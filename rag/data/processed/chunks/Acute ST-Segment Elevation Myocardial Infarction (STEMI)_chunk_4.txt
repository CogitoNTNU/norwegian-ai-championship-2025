and greater than 0.15 mV for women.[19] Promptly identifying occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) in patients with acute chest pain is crucial to enable rapid revascularization. In left bundle branch block (LBBB) cases, interpreting the ECG can be particularly challenging due to ST-segment changes associated with this pattern. The Sgarbossa criteria were developed to enhance the detection of acute myocardial infarction in patients with LBBB, relying on the concordance between the QRS complex and the ST segment.[20] Typically, in an ECG with LBBB without OMI, the "principle of appropriate discordance" applies. The ST segment is oriented opposite to the QRS complex, which means that in leads where the QRS is predominantly positive, the ST segment is negative. Conversely, the ST segment is elevated in leads with a predominantly negative QRS complex. In OMI cases, the ST segment may show "concordant" changes with the QRS or exhibit "excessive" discordant elevation. The Sgarbossa criteria include this excessively discordant ST elevation (greater than 0.5 mV) as a 3rd criterion, along with concordant ST-segment changes. While these criteria are highly specific, their sensitivity for detecting OMI is limited.[21] Patients with a preexisting LBBB can be further evaluated using the Sgarbossa criteria: - ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is concordant with or in the same direction as the QRS complex - ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in lead V1, V2, or V3 - ST-segment elevation of 5 mm or more (that is discordant with or in the opposite direction of the QRS complex)[22] The ACC, AHA, and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) have issued class I recommendations based on recent evidence.[23] For patients experiencing STEMI with ischemic symptoms lasting less than 12 hours, PCI is recommended to enhance survival outcomes. In cases of STEMI where reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy is unsuccessful, performing rescue PCI on the infarct-related artery is advised to improve clinical outcomes. Primary PCI is recommended for patients with STEMI who present with cardiogenic shock or acute severe heart failure, regardless of the time elapsed since the onset of the myocardial infarction.[23] **Cardiac Biomarkers** Once STEMI and very high-risk NSTE-ACS are ruled out, biomarkers become essential for confirming the diagnosis, assessing risk, and managing suspected cases of ACS. Measuring a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, such as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), is recommended for all patients with suspected ACS. If the clinical presentation aligns with myocardial ischemia, an
