with or without organic failure for less than 48 hours. - In severe acute pancreatitis, there is persistent organ failure for more than 48 hours with the involvement of 1 or more than 1 organ. The pancreas is a digestive gland organ found in front of vertebrae L1 and L2 bodies on the posterior abdominal wall. The pancreas lies transversely between the duodenum on the right and the spleen on the left. It is divided into 4 parts: the head, neck, body, and tail. The head of the pancreas lies on the inferior vena cava and the right renal vein and is surrounded by the loop of the duodenum. The tail of the pancreas extends up to the splenic hilum. The primary function of the pancreas can be divided into exocrine and endocrine secretions. The exocrine secretion (pancreatic juice from the acinar cells) enters the duodenum through the main and accessory pancreatic ducts, and endocrine secretions (glucagon and insulin from the pancreatic islets of Langerhans) enter the blood.[6] ## Etiology The most common causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia (see **Image.** Acute Pancreatitis, Gallstones). The occurrence rate of each acute pancreatitis etiology varies across geographic regions and socioeconomic strata. Common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are listed below.[4][7][8] - Gallstones - Alcohol use - Hypertriglyceridemia - Drug-induced pancreatitis - Idiopathic - Post-procedural, eg, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or abdominal surgery - Ampullary stenosis, which is formerly known as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type I - Autoimmune pancreatitis, type I (systemic IgG4 disease-related), and type II - Viral infections like Coxsackie, Cytomegalovirus, Echovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis A/B/C, HIV, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella - Bacterial infections like _Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella, Leptospirosis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycoplasma_ - Smoking - Trauma - Congenital anomalies, eg, annular pancreas - Genetic disorders like hereditary pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency - Hypercalcemia - Parasitic infections _(Ascaris lumbricoides, Cryptosporidium, Clonorchis Sinensis, Microsporidia_) - Renal disease (Hemodialysis) - Toxins (Scorpion bites, organophosphate poisoning) - Vasculitis (Polyarteritis nodosa, Systemic lupus erythematosus) The causes of acute pancreatitis can be summarized into the following categories in the table below.

Whether this trend is related to an actual increase in incidence or increased detection, the rise is partly
