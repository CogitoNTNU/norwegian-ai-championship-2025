On physical examination, the patient may appear uncomfortable or anxious due to pain, with signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and tachycardia, especially in the case of persistent vomiting. Abdominal inspection may reveal visible peristalsis and distension, particularly in thin patients. Palpation often demonstrates tenderness, especially over the obstruction site, and may reveal palpable dilated bowel loops in more severe cases. Percussion typically reveals a tympanic abdomen due to gas-filled loops, though dullness can occur in cases of fluid accumulation or bowel perforation. Early in the obstruction, bowel sounds may be hyperactive or high-pitched as the body attempts to overcome the blockage. However, in more severe cases, bowel sounds may become absent, mainly if strangulation or ischemia is present.[23] A rectal examination may be helpful to check for fecal impaction, which could contribute to the obstruction. In some cases, the absence of stool could suggest a more proximal obstruction. Finally, if peritonitis or bowel perforation is suspected, the patient may develop signs of peritonitis, such as rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding, indicating a surgical emergency. This history and physical exam are critical in establishing the diagnosis, determining whether the obstruction is partial or complete, and guiding further imaging studies and treatment decisions. ## Evaluation The evaluation of SBO involves a combination of laboratory tests, radiographic imaging, and occasionally more specialized studies. These tests are crucial for confirming the diagnosis, determining the severity and cause of the obstruction, and guiding appropriate management. **Laboratory Tests** Laboratory testing in SBO primarily assesses the patient's overall health, identifies complications, and helps to monitor for signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or infection: - Complete blood count (CBC) - A CBC may show leukocytosis, indicating infection or inflammation, which can be seen in strangulated obstruction or peritonitis cases. Anemia may be present in cases of chronic obstruction due to subclinical blood loss or nutritional deficiencies. - Electrolytes and renal function - A basic or comprehensive metabolic panel can assess hydration status, electrolyte imbalances (such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis), and kidney function. Vomiting, fluid sequestration in the intestines, and third-spacing of fluids can lead to dehydration, which, if severe, may result in prerenal acute kidney injury. - Arterial blood gas (ABG) - An ABG panel - may reveal metabolic alkalosis in prolonged vomiting or bowel ischemia, while lactic acidosis may indicate bowel ischemia or infarction. - Lactate levels - Elevated lactate levels can
