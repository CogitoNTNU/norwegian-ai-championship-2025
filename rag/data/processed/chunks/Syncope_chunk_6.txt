strategies; however, this is only a limited summary as the topic is vast. **Arrhythmias** **Sinus Node Dysfunction** Sinus node abnormalities will typically lead to bradyarrhythmias. When sinus bradycardia is noted, the first intervention should assess iatrogenic causes, such as medications with bradycardia as an intended or unintended effect. If such medications are in use and unnecessary to the patient, they should be terminated. Otherwise, pacemakers should be the next step sought out in management. Implantable dual-chamber pacemakers are recommended to prevent future syncopal events. Implantation of a pacemaker should theoretically circumvent this outcome.[18] However, there has not been a proven improvement in overall survival from this intervention, and 20% of these patients who receive pacemakers experience recurrent syncopal events.[19] **Atrioventricular Conduction System Dysfunction** In cases of Mobitz type 2 second-degree or third-degree AV block, pacemaker implantation helps prevent recurrence of syncope.[18] Biventricular pacing modes are recommended in patients with coexisting heart failure, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, or prolonged QRS segments noted on the electrocardiogram.[17] **Fascicular Blocks** Implantable permanent pacemakers are recommended for patients with concerning histories and syncope in the setting of bifascicular or trifascicular bundle branch blocks.[18] **Tachyarrhythmias** Management of tachycardic syncope sources is more complex, as many cases of tachycardic arrhythmias that precipitate syncope are self-limited. Supraventricular tachycardia can occur in patients with alternative atrioventricular nodal reentrant pathways. In such circumstances, catheter ablation of the alternative pathway is the best treatment modality. Medications are often utilized as a bridge to this definitive management if catheter ablation is not immediately possible. Management of atrial fibrillation should be first attempted conservatively with a medication-based rate or rhythm control and then with ablation if such conservative therapy fails. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia-induced syncope can be managed with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. If this is insufficient, antiarrhythmic agents can be employed. Amiodarone is the first-line antiarrhythmic followed by class 1A and 1B antiarrhythmics. If syncopal events are frequent and unresponsive to medications, radiofrequency catheter ablation of the foci from which the tachycardia originates can be performed. In cases of ventricular tachycardia-induced syncope in the setting of underlying structural cardiac disease, patients may benefit from an implanted cardiac defibrillator.[10] Although the placement of a cardiac defibrillator in such patients has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death, these devices do not decrease patients' risk of recurrent syncopal events or the resultant associated physical injuries and expenses.[17] Acquired QT Interval
