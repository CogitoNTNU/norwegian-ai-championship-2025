and culture. \_**Microscopic Analysis** \_ The microscopic analysis includes the analysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a gram stain. Microscopy can be helpful in determining a possible pathogen and antibiotic selection until the results of the culture are available. The presence of abundant neutrophils and the bacterial morphology may suggest a likely pathogen. \_**Quantitative Cultures** \_ Diagnostic thresholds include: - Endotracheal aspirates 1,000,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL - Bronchoscopic- or mini-BAL 10,000 CFU/mL - PSB 1000 CFU/mL[6][7] \_**New Molecular Diagnostic Tests** \_ New molecular diagnostic tests like multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, which detects an array of respiratory bacterial pathogens and many antibiotic resistance genes, offer the advantage of rapid identification of pathogens and resistance patterns for rapid choosing the antibiotic regimens.[8] ## Treatment / Management Initial empiric therapy for HAP and VAP should include agents active against _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , and other gram-negative bacilli. The choice of antibiotics for empiric therapy should be based on the common pathogens and susceptibility patterns within the healthcare facilities and also based on the patient's risk factors for multidrug resistance.[9][2] - For patients with HAP who have a risk factor for MRSA infection, specifically those with prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where greater than 20% of _S. aureus_ isolates are methicillin-resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, prescribe an antibiotic active against MRSA like vancomycin or linezolid is recommended (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include the need for ventilator support due to HAP and septic shock. - For patients with HAP with no risk factors for MRSA infection and not at high risk of mortality, prescribe an antibiotic with activity against MSSA like piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem. - For patients with HAP who have factors for _Pseudomonas_ or other gram-negative infection or high risk for mortality, prescribe antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against _P. aeruginosa_ (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Other patients with HAP may be prescribed a single antibiotic active against _P. aeruginosa,_ like piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, and aztreonam.[2] **Continuation Therapy** All patients with HAP or VAP should be reevaluated for clinical response and microbiologic results after initial empiric antimicrobial therapy. - For patients in whom the causative organism has been identified, the empiric regimen should be narrowed according to
