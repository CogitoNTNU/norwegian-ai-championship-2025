impacts the bronchial tree, leading to irritation, inflammation, and increased mucus production. Viral infections, such as the common cold or influenza viruses, adenovirus, and rhinovirus, are frequent instigators, although exposure to irritants or other respiratory pathogens can also be putative triggers.[4] These viruses are transmitted through respiratory droplets and induce inflammation and irritation within the bronchial tree, ultimately leading to the characteristic symptoms of acute bronchitis, which encompass coughing, sputum production, and respiratory discomfort. Bacterial pathogens play a role in approximately 10% or less of acute bronchitis instances. Among these bacterial pathogens, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ , and _Bordetella pertussis_ are the most commonly identified offenders.[5] In contrast, the majority, approximately 90% to 95%, of cases in healthy adults are attributed to viral infections. Additional factors, including allergens, irritants, and occasionally bacterial pathogens, can also incite acute bronchitis.[6] A higher prevalence of influenza viruses A and B are seen in the winter months, escalating transmission and infection rates. These viruses exhibit ease in spreading within crowded indoor settings like schools, workplaces, and public gatherings, where close interpersonal contact facilitates their transmission through respiratory droplets. Influenza viruses' efficiency in infecting and replicating within the respiratory tract allows for rapid viral multiplication, culminating in significant damage to the bronchiolar epithelial cells. This damage, coupled with the body's immune response, contributes to the distinctive symptoms of acute bronchitis.[7][8] While viral infections are more prevalent during the winter season, acute bronchitis can arise at any time of the year, often linked to strains of adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus.[9][10] Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of viral infections causing acute bronchitis throughout the year is essential for healthcare providers and public health officials in implementing effective prevention and control strategies, especially in the context of evolving respiratory viruses and changing environmental factors. Examples of this are as follows: - Influenza, RSV, and human coronaviruses typically exhibit peak incidence during winter. As stated previously, this seasonal pattern arises as people tend to spend more time indoors and engage in close interpersonal contact, creating an environment conducive to the rapid transmission of these viruses. - Rhinoviruses typically experience peaks in incidence during the spring and fall seasons, coinciding with shifts in weather patterns. Seasonal allergies may also contribute to these peaks by potentially facilitating the transmission of the virus during these times. - Enteroviruses, a group encompassing several viruses responsible for respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, peak in summer.
