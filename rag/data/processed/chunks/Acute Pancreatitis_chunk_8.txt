validated prospectively, and it is simple and easy to calculate from initial presentation data. Compared with other scoring systems like Ranson criteria and APACHE II score, the BISAP score outperforms in specificity but has a suboptimal sensitivity for mortality and SAP.[34] BISAP score - 0-2 points indicates lower mortality of less than 2%, and 3-5 points indicate higher mortality more significant than 15%.

It can aid in predicting mortality and detecting any necrosis on CT imaging as a predictor of high mortality.[35] Total points are out of ten, which helps determine the grade of pancreatitis and aid in treatment; 0 to 2 is mild, 4 to 6 is moderate, and 8 to 10 is severe.

Systemic inflammation can lead to multiorgan
