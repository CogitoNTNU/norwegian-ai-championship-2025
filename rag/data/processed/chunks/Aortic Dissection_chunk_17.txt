can improve coping mechanisms and adherence to management strategies. **Emergency Plans** Patients at high risk for AAD should have a clear emergency action plan. This includes: - Knowing the location of the nearest hospital with advanced imaging capabilities - Understanding when and how to call emergency services (eg, for sudden severe pain or neurological symptoms) - Having a summary of their medical history, including prior imaging results and medications, readily available for healthcare providers in case of an emergency ## Pearls and Other Issues Despite optimal circumstances, diagnosing every case of AAD in the emergency department remains a significant challenge. One contributing factor is the variability in symptom severity, as some patients may present with relatively mild symptoms that do not immediately raise suspicion for AAD. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings may also mimic other conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis. Another factor complicating diagnosis is the absence of expected physical exam findings, such as a pulse deficit or a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, which are not always present even in confirmed cases of AAD. Every patient presenting with chest pain must be approached with the consideration that they could potentially have an AAD to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses. Establishing a detailed risk factor profile, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and being vigilant about atypical or subtle presentations are critical components of effective evaluation and diagnosis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of aortic dissection requires a coordinated, patient-centered approach involving a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including advanced clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied healthcare professionals. Each team member enhances patient outcomes and ensures safety. Clinicians, such as cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, lead diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. At the same time, advanced clinicians and nurses provide continuous bedside monitoring, patient education, and early recognition of complications. Pharmacists contribute by optimizing pharmacologic therapies, ensuring medication safety, and counseling patients on medication adherence and blood pressure management, which is critical for long-term prognosis. Open communication between team members is vital to improving outcomes.[22][28][29] Regular team meetings and a shared care plan help align treatment goals and strategies, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing patient safety. This approach ensures that all providers are aware of the patientâ€™s status, recent interventions, and any changes in management plans. Care coordination extends beyond the acute phase, with outpatient follow-up and rehabilitation planning guided by the
