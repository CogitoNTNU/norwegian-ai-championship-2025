Sudden bankruptcy - Divorce - Loss of employment Physical triggers: - Stroke - Sepsis - Vaginal delivery - Chemotherapy ## Epidemiology Based on a systemic review of studies, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy accounts for approximately 2% of the ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) population, with about 90% of the cases found in post-menopausal women. The mortality rate in hospitals is 1.1% among these patients, and approximately 3.5% of these patients showed recurrence of this phenomenon.[3] Mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare form that accounts for about 14.6% of patients with this syndrome. These patients have mid-ventricular ballooning and apical/basal hyperdynamic segments.[4] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiology behind this disorder is not truly well understood; however, there are specific mechanisms that are involved in this disorder. Proposed mechanisms are a combination of spasm of the coronary arteries, microvascular dysfunction, and catecholamine surge. The role of catecholamines during the surge is the cause of microvascular dysfunction resulting in catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity.[5] ## Histopathology Limited data does suggest histopathologic signs of catecholamine toxicity which include but are not limited to:[6][7][8][9] - Interstitial fibrosis with evidence of cellular infiltration - Interstitial fibrosis without evidence of cellular infiltration - Mononuclear infiltrates and contraction band necrosis - No histopathologic evidence of myocarditis ## History and Physical A typical presentation of mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is similar to the other known variants of this syndrome, which mimic acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, ECG changes, and elevation of cardiac enzymes) and is triggered by stress. It is vital to obtain an accurate history of these patients as they might be able to communicate recent stressors. These include the death of a loved one, suffering from a natural disaster, the news of a new medical diagnosis, divorce, gambling losses, or financial bankruptcy. In the International Takotsubo Registry, approximately 28% of the patient who presented with this type of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the other kinds of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy had reported triggers of emotional nature. About 36% had a physical trigger such as infection or respiratory failure, approximately 8% had both physical and emotional triggers, and 28.5% did not have any emotional or physical triggers identified.[4] ## Evaluation Evaluation of this type of stress cardiomyopathy involves an electrocardiogram to evaluated for ST-segment elevation commonly found in the anterior precordial leads. Data from the International Takotsubo Registry Study shows ST-segment elevation in approximately 44% of the patients with any type of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.[4][10] Other less common electrocardiogram
