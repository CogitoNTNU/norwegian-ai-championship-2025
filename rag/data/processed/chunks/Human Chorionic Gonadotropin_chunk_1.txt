home-based capillary hCG testing, although research on this is still ongoing.[3] ## Diagnostic Tests Serum hCG tests are immunometric assays that use 2 antibodies—a fixed antibody and a radiolabeled antibody, which adhere to different sites on the hCG molecule. These antibodies form a sandwich complex that immobilizes the molecule, allowing for its detection.[4] Assays involve washing away the excess serum components and measuring the amount of remaining labeled hCG to give a quantitative result. More than 100 different assays are commercially available, which results in significant variability in reported values. Urine assays are similar, although many detect total hCG levels >20 mIU/mL.[5] Many over-the-counter urine pregnancy tests do not detect hyperglycosylated hCG, which accounts for most of the hCG in early pregnancy, resulting in a wide range of sensitivities of these tests. Serum testing is much more sensitive and specific than urine testing. However, urine testing offers greater convenience, affordability, patient comfort, a rapid turnaround time (typically 5 to 10 minutes), and can be performed without a prescription. As mentioned earlier, capillary testing has recently shown good agreement and strong correlation with venous samples.[3] ## Testing Procedures hCG testing is a crucial diagnostic tool used in both obstetric and oncologic settings. A clear understanding of testing procedures helps ensure accuracy in detecting pregnancy and identifying potential underlying conditions. **Urine Testing** - Urine is placed in or on a designated receptacle, such as those used in most commercially available and medical point-of-care tests. - If hCG is present, an indicator—typically a colored line or symbol—appears alongside a control line, indicating a positive result. - If the test is negative, only the control line or symbol is visible. **Serum Testing** - Serum hCG testing is performed in a laboratory equipped with the proper machinery and uses a peripheral blood sample. - If a hook effect or gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, the laboratory should perform a dilution before testing. ## Interfering Factors There are multiple reasons why an hCG test—whether serum or urine—may yield a false result. Although rare, false-positive hCG tests can result in unnecessary medical care and irreversible surgical procedures.[6] False-negative results may be equally concerning and result in a delay in care or diagnostic evaluation. Potential causes of false results are outlined below. **False-Positive Serum hCG Results** - Rates of approximately 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 cases - Ectopic production of hCG can occur in conditions such
