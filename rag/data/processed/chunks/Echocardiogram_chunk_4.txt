procedures, which include transeptal puncture.[12] As ICE obtains images from within the heart, higher resolution images are obtained to help guide catheter-directed procedures. Due to advances in TEE, there has been limited use for ICE; however, as there has been an increase in transvenous catheter procedures, ICE is being considered further.[12] Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be performed during cardiac catheterization to directly visualize atherosclerosis within the vessel walls; this is utilized when the extent and severity of stenosis are indeterminant during PCI.[13] Clinical trials have found improved luminal gains, decreased re-stenosis, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), and the need for revascularization when compared to angiography alone. To overcome the limitations of both angiography and IVUS, the use of both during the same intervention can provide more accurate reconstructions of plaques size and volume.[14] Strain rate (STR) Echocardiography, also known as deformation echocardiography, is indicated when there is high suspicion for wall motion abnormalities. However, TTE is initially used to evaluate wall abnormalities; it is based on visual estimates, which may be subjective because it is operator dependant.[15] If TTE imaging is not clear or evident enough, ST and STR echocardiography may be utilized as an adjunct for a more accurate and objective evaluation of wall motion abnormalities. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is used when a clearer image of cardiac structures, and how to relate to each other is required. This is used most often used with presurgical planning for interventional procedures, as it can prove improved views of valvular structures.[16] 3D echocardiography has also found to add prognostic value to wall motion abnormalities in those with ischemia and assessing viability in patients with myocardial infarction.[17] Contrast echocardiography has been studied extensively in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and has been found to be of independent prognostic and diagnostic benefit.[18] The injection of agitated saline uses air microbubbles as contrast, which are used to detect right-to-left shunts in patients who are found to have a CVA or for evaluation of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Further clinical indications include the assessment of wall motion abnormalities at rest, apical left ventricular thrombus, rupture, and aneurysm, apical hypertrophy, cardiac masses, and during perfusion imaging.[18] ## Contraindications Standard echocardiography does not have absolute contraindications, other than a patient's refusal. It is important to know that patient body habitus may limit the image clarity and amount of useful data that can be obtained. There are, however, contraindications to
