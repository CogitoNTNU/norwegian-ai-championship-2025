Early diagnosis has a central role in allowing a timely reperfusion strategy. The de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is a finding that, in a proper setting, is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. This electrocardiogram finding consists of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall, peaked positive T waves. The pattern is considered to be equivalent to an ST elevation as a clinical indication of myocardial infarction. Therefore, clinical recognition of this finding and the additional evaluation it should precipitate is critical to improving patient outcomes. Emergent consultation with a cardiologist should be undertaken when the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is observed to allow for timely cardiac catheterization and primary percutaneous coronary intervention, if appropriate, to ensure appropriate reperfusion as per ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients who present with the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Apply the pathophysiology of the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern. - Identify the typical presentation and the adequate evaluation of patients with the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern. - Compare the differential diagnosis associated with the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern. - Collaborate amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern in an appropriate clinical context.
