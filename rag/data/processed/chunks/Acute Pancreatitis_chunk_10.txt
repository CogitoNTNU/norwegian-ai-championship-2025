keep meticulous records of every interaction or intervention with the patient so that everyone involved in care can access the same accurate, updated patient data. This interprofessional approach yields the best possible patient results. **Outcomes** Acute pancreatitis is a severe disorder that still carries a mortality of 5 to 15%, depending on the cause, patient age, and comorbidity. Patients with gallstone pancreatitis generally have higher mortality than those with alcoholic pancreatitis. In addition, the presence of type 2 diabetes significantly increases the risk of complications and death. In patients with multiorgan involvement, the mortality can be as high as 20%. Most deaths are due to multiorgan failure and hypotensive shock. Various classifications have been developed to assess the prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis, but most are cumbersome for practical use.[39][40][41] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26578&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26578) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/acute-pancreatitis-pancreatitis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26578) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26578/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26578) [![Signs and Symptoms of Acute Pancreatitis](/books/NBK482468/bin/medical1-01.gif)](/books/NBK482468/figure/article-26578.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK482468/figure/article-26578.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Signs and Symptoms of Acute Pancreatitis.
