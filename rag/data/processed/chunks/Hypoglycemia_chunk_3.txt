disorder in the first place that has a poor outcome, and many patients would continue to harm themselves till they get a permanent medical injury. Patients with factitious hypoglycemia may get complications of acute hypoglycemia if they suffer delays in access to healthcare and blood sugar is not corrected immediately; these include cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, strokes, coma, and eventually death.[18] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients usually tend to underestimate the consequences of low blood sugar. Many individuals may self-inject insulin or take other blood sugar lowering drugs to produce hypoglycemia symptoms and get individual attention and sympathy. If you feel that a close friend or family member is at risk of such behavior, especially if they have access to insulin or other diabetes medications, it is highly relevant to educate them and help them address their concerns with their primary care provider before they develop significant complications of hypoglycemia. ## Pearls and Other Issues Autoimmune insulin hypoglycemia is a rare disease in which patients would still be continuously present with hypoglycemia and elevated endogenous plasma insulin. It can be differentiated from insulinoma and factitious hypoglycemia by detecting insulin autoantibodies in the blood.[10] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Communication between healthcare providers can help in early detection of factitious hypoglycemia in patients who present with recurrent unexplained hypoglycemic episodes, as early recognition is associated with a better prognosis and can save a lot of time and effort. In diabetic patients who are already on insulin, diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia can be challenging. In this situation, Patients can be admitted under observation for a few days in a monitored setting, with insulin administration and glucose checks performed by the nursing staff and frequent reporting to the interprofessional team. The team must work collaboratively to educate the patient and family to create the best environment to achieve optimal results. Factitious hypoglycemia requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, mental health professionals, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
