It is usually the result of the progression of acute cholecystitis in a background of bile stasis and cystic duct obstruction. This is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and urgent aspiration/removal of the gallbladder to reduce the risk of septic shock. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of gallbladder empyemas and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients. **Objectives:** - Review the risk factors for developing gallbladder empyema. - Describe the typical imaging findings associated with gallbladder empyema. - Outline the management considerations for patients with gallbladder empyema. - Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gallbladder empyema.

Empyema of the gallbladder is usually the result of a progression of acute cholecystitis in a background of bile stasis and cystic duct obstruction. This is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and urgent aspiration/removal of the gallbladder to reduce the risk of septic shock.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Frequently empyema of the gallbladder is associated with calculus cholecystitis, where there is an obstructed cystic duct and stasis of bile. The stagnant bile in the gallbladder has superinfection with microorganisms that lead to suppuration in an acutely inflamed gallbladder. Hence the gallbladder lumen becomes filled with exudative material and very often frank pus. Rarely empyema of the gallbladder may present in association with common bile duct stones or carcinoma of the gallbladder. Empyema can also occur in calculus cholecystitis.[4][5] Organisms frequently isolated include Clostridia, Bacteroides, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli. ## Epidemiology Empyema of the gallbladder is estimated to occur in 5 to 15% of cases diagnosed to have acute cholecystitis. It is noted to be the more morbid condition when occurring in the older age group. There is a higher preponderance of males who develop this disease. Patients with
