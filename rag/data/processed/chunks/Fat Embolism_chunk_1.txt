research on this condition is in orthopedic patients. Even though the clinical criteria proposed by Gurd et al and Wilson can help or aid in the diagnosis, FES still poses a major diagnostic challenge to most clinicians.[1][2] ## Etiology **Traumatic Causes** Traumatic causes of FES are more common than nontraumatic causes. Trauma as a cause of FES can occur from the fracture of the long bones, such as the femur and tibia, and also the pelvis. Operations such as pelvis or knee arthroplasty and intramedullary nailing and reaming can cause FES. The technique of inserting the intramedullary nails that can increase the likelihood of development of FES includes increased velocity in reaming, overzealousness in the nailing of the medullary cavity, and the widened gap between the nail and the cortex of the bone Other rare traumatic conditions that can cause FES include the following: - Massive soft tissue damage - Crush injury - Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation - Severe burn involving more than 50% of body surface area - Bone marrow transplantation - Liposuction - Median sternotomy **Nontraumatic Causes** Cases of nontraumatic FES are very rare and include the following: - Fatty Liver - Acute or chronic pancreatitis - Therapy with corticosteroid - Infusion of fat emulsion - Lymphography - Hemoglobinopathies - Sickle cell disease - Thalassemia Several risk factors are associated with the development of FES. The following conditions increase the risk of developing FES: - Young age - Closed fractures - Multiple fractures - Prolonged conservative management of long bone fracture ## Epidemiology Variable data on the incidence of fat embolism and FES have been reported. Clinical diagnosis of small fat embolism or mild cases of FES may be missed and go unnoticed. In 1 study, about 67% of orthopedic trauma patients have fat globules in their blood. If the blood sample was taken from a site close to the area of the fracture, the incidence is closer to 95%. Fat embolism and FES can also occur intraoperatively while repairing a long bone fracture. A transesophageal echocardiogram detected fat embolism in nearly 41% of patients. Fat embolism has a higher incidence than FES. In the landmark study carried out by Gurd, using the established clinical criteria, an incidence of 19% of FES was reported in a group of trauma patients. Since early open reduction and internal fixation have become the standard of care for repairing fractures of long bones,
