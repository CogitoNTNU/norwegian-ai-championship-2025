A thorough preoperative assessment, including pulmonary function evaluation and medication optimization, is crucial for assessing asthma control and minimizing surgical risks. Anesthetic management should prioritize agents with bronchodilatory properties or those that attenuate the bronchospastic response, such as sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, and ketamine, while avoiding agents that may increase airway resistance, such as desflurane. Experts recommend using intravenous induction, premedicating with bronchodilators, minimizing airway manipulation, and opting for less invasive airway devices when possible. A comprehensive, individualized anesthesia plan based on evidence-based guidelines helps ensure safer surgical outcomes in patients with asthma. Postoperatively, close monitoring for respiratory distress, maintaining adequate oxygenation, and continuing preoperative asthma medications, including inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, are critical to ensuring optimal recovery. This activity for healthcare professionals enhances the learner's ability to assess and optimize asthma control in patients undergoing surgery, ultimately improving patient safety and perioperative outcomes. Participants better understand risk assessment and evidence-based anesthesia strategies to minimize complications. Participants become more proficient in selecting bronchodilator-friendly anesthetic agents, minimizing excess stimulation of the airways, and implementing intraoperative monitoring techniques. This activity emphasizes patient-centered care by underscoring the importance of preoperative optimization through medication management, comprehensive individualized anesthesia planning, and coordinated perioperative monitoring to prevent respiratory distress. By mastering the complexities of anesthesia care in patients with asthma, healthcare professionals enhance patient safety, reduce pulmonary complications, and improve overall team performance in delivering individualized, effective anesthesia management. **Objectives:** - Screen patients preoperatively for asthma severity, medication use, and recent exacerbations to optimize perioperative management. - Identify key risk factors and triggers that increase perioperative respiratory complications in patients with asthma. - Assess the impact of anesthetic agents on airway reactivity and select the most appropriate agents for patients with asthma. - Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to optimize perioperative asthma care.
