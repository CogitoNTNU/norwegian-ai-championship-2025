Pneumomediastinum develops when air extravasates from within the airways, lungs, or esophagus and migrates into the mediastinal space. Extravasated air may then dissect contiguously into the neighboring cervical subcutaneous tissues, epidural space, pericardium, and/or the peritoneal cavity. As a clinical entity, pneumomediastinum is rare and typically self-limited. Once diagnosed and serious concomitant pathology excluded, management is largely focused on symptomatic treatment. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of pneumomediastinum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Explain the pathophysiology of pneumomediastinum. - Describe the imaging findings associated with pneumomediastinum. - Review the management of pneumomediastinum. - Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with pneumomediastinum.

The mediastinum is the space in the central thorax bounded laterally by the parietal pleura of the lungs, superiorly by the thoracic outlet, inferiorly by the diaphragm, anteriorly by the sternum, and posteriorly by the thoracic vertebral column. Vital structures, such as the heart, tracheobronchial tree, and the esophagus, reside within the mediastinum.[1] Pneumomediastinum develops when air extravasates from within the airways, lungs, or esophagus and migrates into the mediastinal space. Extravasated air may then dissect contiguously into the neighboring cervical subcutaneous tissues, epidural space, pericardium, or the peritoneal cavity.[2] As a clinical entity, pneumomediastinum is rare and typically self-limited. Once diagnosed and serious concomitant pathology excluded, management is largely focused on symptomatic treatment. ## Etiology Spontaneous or primary pneumomediastinum occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no identifiable cause. Secondary pneumomediastinum includes all cases in which an underlying cause such as trauma can be elicited. The most common cause of pneumomediastinum is alveolar rupture.[3] **Risk Factors for Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum** - Smoking or tobacco use - Recreational drug inhalation (cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, ecstasy) **Causes of Secondary Pneumomediastinum** **Intrinsic Lung and Airway Causes** - Asthma - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) -
