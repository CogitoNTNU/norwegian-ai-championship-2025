**Stage B** : Pre-HF. Patients have no signs or symptoms of HF but have risk factors and structural heart disease, evidence of elevated filling pressures (by invasive or noninvasive assessment), or persistently elevated cardiomarkers in the absence of other reasons for elevated markers, like chronic kidney disease or myocarditis. - **Stage C** : Symptomatic HF. Patients with current or past history of HF symptoms. - **Stage D** : Advanced HF. Patients with refractory symptoms that interfere with daily life or recurrent hospitalization despite targeted guideline-directed medical therapy. ## Prognosis According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in December 2015, the rate of HF-related deaths decreased from 103.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 89.5 in 2009 but subsequently increased to 96.9 in 2014. The report noted that the trend correlates with a shift from coronary heart disease as the underlying cause of HF deaths to metabolic diseases and other noncardiac causes of HF, including obesity, diabetes, malignancies, chronic pulmonary diseases, and renal disease. The mortality rate following hospitalization for HF is estimated at around 10% at 30 days, 22% at 1 year, and 42% at 5 years. This can increase to >50% for patients with stage D HF.[48] **Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score** The Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score is a useful tool for determining prognosis in patients presenting to the emergency department with HF.[49] This score is used to determine the 14-day mortality risk, hospital readmission, and acute coronary syndrome to help arrive at safe disposition planning. Patients with a score of 0 are considered low risk. A score of 1 to 2 is considered moderate risk, a score of 3 to 4 is considered high risk, and a score of 5 or higher is considered very high risk. Each of the following criteria is given 1 point if present: - History of stroke or transient ischemic attack - Oxygen saturation \<90% - Heart rate >110 bpm on the 3-minute walk test - Acute ischemic ECG changes - An NT-ProBNP level of >5000 ng/L Each of the following criteria is given 2 points if present: - Prior history of mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress - Heart rate >110 bpm on presentation - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >33.6 mg/dL (12 mmol/L) - Serum bicarbonate level >35 mg/d ## Complications Complications of HF include: - Reduced quality of life - Arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death - Cardiac
