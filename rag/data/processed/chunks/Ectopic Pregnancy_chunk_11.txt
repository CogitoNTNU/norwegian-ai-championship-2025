obstetricians, radiologists, and pharmacists. Emergency physicians and obstetricians must collaborate closely to confirm the diagnosis, determine the appropriate management plan, and discuss treatment options with the patient. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the safe administration of methotrexate when medical management is appropriate, providing education on potential adverse effects, and monitoring requirements. Nurses are responsible for patient education, emotional support, and posttreatment follow-up, reinforcing adherence to care plans and recognizing potential complications. By fostering teamwork, clear communication, and adherence to established protocols, healthcare professionals can enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure the highest patient safety standards in managing ectopic pregnancy. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27633&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27633) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/ectopic-pregnancy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27633) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27633/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27633) [![Ectopic Pregnancy](/books/NBK539860/bin/A__-__pos__FAST__ectopic.gif)](/books/NBK539860/figure/article-27633.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK539860/figure/article-27633.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Ectopic Pregnancy.
