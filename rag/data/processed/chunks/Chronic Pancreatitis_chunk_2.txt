tobacco use are the primary contributors in men, whereas idiopathic and obstructive causes are more common in women.[14] Overall, the condition is more prevalent in men, likely due to higher rates of alcohol and tobacco use. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 45 years, with onset occurring about a decade later in parts of China.[15] ## Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis appears to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Studies have identified pancreatitis susceptibility genes associated with loss of function. Two main theories explain the development of chronic pancreatic disease. The first theory suggests that impaired bicarbonate secretion fails to counterbalance increased pancreatic protein secretion. As a result, excess proteins form plugs within the lobules and ducts, leading to calcification and stone formation. The second theory involves the intraparenchymal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas, potentially triggered by genetic predisposition or external influences such as alcohol consumption. Recent research suggests that alcohol diminishes the cell's ability to respond to calcium signaling. This reduced response disrupts the feedback mechanism and initiates a cycle of cellular damage, leading to cell death.[16][17] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, characterized by steatorrhea and azotorrhea, becomes clinically evident after over 90% of pancreatic function is lost.[1] This condition typically manifests at least 5 years after the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis. Although the first and second episodes rarely lead to chronic disease, the likelihood rises from 16% to 50% after the third or fourth episode. A proposed explanation is that alcoholic pancreatitis is more likely to recur than biliary pancreatitis, which typically occurs only once. Continued alcohol consumption contributes to progressive pancreatic damage. In addition, each recurrent episode causes further injury to an already compromised pancreas. By the third episode and beyond, acute pancreatitis tends to be more severe than the initial occurrences. Individuals with 3 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis often exhibit clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis.[18] A conceptual model outlining the progression of chronic pancreatitis has been published.[3] The model describes the following distinct stages: - At risk: Individuals are asymptomatic before the first pancreatic injury. - Acute pancreatitis to recurrent acute pancreatitis: The first (sentinel) episode of acute pancreatitis occurs, followed by recurrent acute pancreatitis. - Early chronic pancreatitis: Biomarkers of chronic pancreatitis become detectable. At this stage, the condition may either resolve or progress
