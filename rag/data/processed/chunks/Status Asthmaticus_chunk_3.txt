incidence of 47%.[18][19] **Childhood** Wheezing caused by viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, may predispose infants and young children to develop asthma later in life. In addition, early-life exposure to air pollution, including combustion by-products from gas-fired appliances and indoor fires, obesity, and early puberty, also increases the risk of asthma. **Adulthood** The most significant risk factors for adult-onset asthma include tobacco smoke, occupational exposure, and adults with rhinitis or atopy. Studies also suggest a modest increase in asthma incidence among postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore, the following factors can contribute to asthma and airway hyperreactivity: - Exposure to environmental allergens such as house dust mites, animal allergens (especially from cats and dogs), cockroach allergens, and fungi - Physical activity or exercise - Conditions such as hyperventilation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and chronic sinusitis - Hypersensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as sulfite sensitivity - Use of Î²-adrenergic receptor blockers, including ophthalmic preparations - Exposure to irritants such as household sprays and paint fumes - Contact with various high- and low-molecular-weight compounds found in insects, plants, latex, gums, diisocyanates, anhydrides, wood dust, and solder fluxes, which are associated with occupational asthma - Emotional factors or stress **Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease** Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease\*\*\*\*(AERD) is a condition characterized by a combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and NSAID intolerance. Patients with AERD present with upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms after ingesting aspirin or NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). This condition arises from dysregulated arachidonic acid metabolism and the overproduction of leukotrienes involving the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. AERD affects approximately 7% of adults with asthma. **Occupational-Induced Asthma** Two types of occupational asthma exist based on their appearance after a latency period: - Occupational asthma triggered by workplace sensitizers results from an allergic or immunological process associated with a latency period induced by both low- and high-molecular-weight agents. High-molecular-weight substances, such as flour, contain proteins and polysaccharides of plant or animal origin. Low-molecular-weight substances, like formaldehyde, form a sensitizing neoantigen when combined with a human protein. - Occupational asthma caused by irritants involves a\*\*\*\* nonallergic or nonimmunological process induced by gases, fumes, smoke, and aerosols. ## Epidemiology The worldwide incidence of asthma is estimated to affect 260 million individuals.[20] Recent studies examining asthma prevalence across 17 countries reveal varying rates, ranging from 3.4% to 6% for adults and children in India, Taiwan,
