clammy skin, can be seen in patients with cardiogenic shock. History plays a very important role in understanding the etiology of the shock and thus helps in the management of cardiogenic shock. The patient should also be assessed for cardiac risk factors: - Diabetes mellitus - Tobacco smoking - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - A family history of premature coronary artery disease - Age older than 45 in men and older than 55 in women - Physical inactivity Physical examination findings in patients with cardiogenic shock include the following: - Altered mental status, cyanosis, cold and clammy skin, mottled extremities - Peripheral pulses are faint, rapid, and sometimes irregular if there is an underlying arrhythmia. - Jugular venous distension - Diminished heart sounds, S3 or S4, may be present, murmurs in the presence of valvular disorders such as mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis. - Pulmonary vascular congestion may be associated with rales. - Peripheral edema may be present in the setting of fluid overload ## Evaluation Rapid diagnosis with prompt supportive therapy and coronary artery revascularization plays a vital role in achieving good outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock.[8][9] Diagnostic evaluation of cardiogenic shock includes the following: - Complete blood picture, comprehensive metabolic panel, magnesium, phosphorous, coagulation profile, thyroid-stimulating hormone - Arterial blood gas - Lactate - Brain natriuretic peptide - Cardiac enzyme test - Chest x-ray - Electrocardiogram - Two-dimensional echocardiography - Ultrasonography to guide fluid management - Coronary angiography ## Treatment / Management Cardiogenic shock is an emergency requiring immediate resuscitative therapy before the irreversible damage of vital organs. Rapid diagnosis with prompt initiation of pharmacological therapy to maintain blood pressure and to maintain respiratory support along with a reversal of underlying cause plays a vital role in the prognosis of patients with cardiogenic shock.[10][4][11] Early restoration of coronary blood is the most important intervention and is the standard therapy for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction. The management of cardiogenic shock involves the following: **Medical Management** The goal of medical management is to restore cardiac output and prevent irreversible end-organ damage rapidly. - The optimal choice of a vasoactive agent in cardiogenic shock is unclear. - Norepinephrine is preferred over dopamine in patients with severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 70 mm Hg) or hypotension unresponsive to other medications as dopamine has been associated with higher rates of arrhythmias and a higher risk of mortality
