However, recent studies highlight the increased utilization of a minimally invasive transcatheter approach, particularly the edge-to-edge leaflet repair device. This catheter-based therapy employs a clip to combine the mitral valve leaflets, effectively reducing regurgitation. The activity explores primary and secondary MR, providing insights into noninvasive catheter management options, indications, contraindications, procedural techniques, and potential complications. Emphasizing the role of interprofessional teams in patient care, the activity offers a comprehensive understanding of catheter-based therapies for MR. Clinicians engaging in this activity gain in-depth knowledge of primary and secondary MR, its categorization, and appropriate treatment choices based on disease duration and severity. The activity explores the nuances of echocardiography, emphasizing the significance of transthoracic and transesophageal imaging modalities in evaluating mitral valve morphology and pathology. Specifically, focusing on the edge-to-edge leaflet repair device gives clinicians a nuanced understanding of minimally invasive, catheter-based approaches. Clinicians enhance their expertise in managing MR by comprehensively exploring indications, procedural techniques, and complications associated with noninvasive catheter interventions. Emphasis is placed on interprofessional collaboration, as it provides a holistic understanding of catheter-based therapies for MR, including indications and contraindications. **Objectives:** - Differentiate between primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, recognizing the underlying etiology and determining the optimal management strategy for each type, considering factors such as left ventricular function, left ventricular size, and atrial fibrillation. - Identify appropriate candidates for catheter management of mitral regurgitation based on a thorough assessment of valve morphology, pathology, and mechanism using transthoracic echocardiography and, when necessary, transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. - Communicate effectively with patients, explaining the risks and benefits of catheter management of mitral regurgitation, ensuring informed consent, and addressing any concerns or questions regarding the procedure. - Collaborate with an interprofessional team, including cardiologists, imaging specialists, anesthesiologists, and nurses, to optimize patient care throughout the entire process, from preoperative evaluation to postprocedural monitoring.
