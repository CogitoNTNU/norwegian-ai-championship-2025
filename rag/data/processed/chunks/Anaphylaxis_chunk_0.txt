Anaphylactic reactions were classified as IgE-mediated responses, while anaphylactoid reactions were classified as IgE-independent events. Physical presentations of anaphylaxis range from mild skin flushing and pruritus to severe respiratory symptoms. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of anaphylaxis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the common inciting sources in the etiology of anaphylaxis. - Assess the IgE-mediated immune response in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis. - Evaluate the clinical criteria used in the evaluation of anaphylaxis. - Communicate the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in patients with anaphylaxis.

It can be defined as a rapidly evolving, generalized, multi-system allergic reaction. Without treatment, anaphylaxis is often fatal due to its rapid progression to respiratory collapse. Historically, anaphylactic reactions were categorized as IgE-mediated responses, while anaphylactoid reactions were categorized as IgE-independent. Recently, these terms have been consolidated into a single diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Regardless of causation, each reaction's resultant clinical state and treatment are identical; therefore, this unified terminology is currently the accepted vernacular.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Common inciting sources may include exposure to certain medications, foods, or insect stings. Immunotherapy injections directed at improving overall allergic response can induce a hyper-acute reaction. Latex hypersensitivity is occurring in increased prevalence, and as with any hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis is an inherent risk. Occasionally, the offending agent is not identified; these reactions are idiopathic anaphylaxis.[4][5][6] The most common causes include bee stings, fire ant bites, latex, and foods (peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, milk, eggs, wheat, spelt, rye, barley, soy, red meat, and sesame). Alpha-gal anaphylaxis: This involves an IgE antibody response to mammalian galactose alpha-1,3-galactose. ## Epidemiology The world population is estimated to have a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 3%, though the prevalence is increasing. While reactions can occur in any age group, they are most commonly noted in the younger population and
