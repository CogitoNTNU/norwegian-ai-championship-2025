or extensive ischemia, second-look laparotomy or temporary abdominal closure techniques, such as vacuum-assisted closure, may be required.[33][34] Hernia-related obstructions are managed with hernia reduction and repair, while tumor-related obstructions often necessitate bowel resection, sometimes with palliative intent in advanced malignancy cases. Palliative options like octreotide can be employed for malignant obstructions.[35] Preventative strategies, such as laparoscopic techniques and barrier agents like a chemically modified membrane made of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose that's applied to the surface of tissues, help reduce adhesion formation. **Postoperative Care** Postoperative care involves close monitoring for complications such as infection, anastomotic leaks, or recurrent obstruction. Early ambulation is encouraged to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and expedite recovery. Nutritional support with gradual reintroduction of oral intake is guided by the resolution of bowel function, evidenced by decreased NG tube output, bowel sounds, and passage of gas or stool. **Management of Functional Obstruction** Functional obstructions, such as paralytic ileus, are treated with supportive measures, including bowel rest, correction of metabolic abnormalities, reduction in narcotic use, and the potential use of prokinetic agents like metoclopramide. **Recurrent Obstructions** For patients with recurrent SBO, often due to adhesions, preventive strategies may include minimally invasive surgical techniques and adhesion barriers during surgery to reduce the formation of future adhesions. **Interdisciplinary Approach** Optimal management of SBO relies on collaboration among surgeons, radiologists, gastroenterologists, critical care specialists, pharmacists, and nursing teams. This interdisciplinary approach enhances patient-centered care, reduces complications, and improves outcomes while minimizing the risk of recurrence. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of SBO encompasses a range of conditions that can mimic or contribute to its clinical presentation. Differentiating among these conditions is critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. The primary categories of differential diagnoses include: - **Mechanical** - Adhesions - Hernias - Neoplasms - Gallstone ileus - Volvulus - Intussusception - Foreign bodies - Crohn disease - **Functional** - Postoperative ileus - Ogilvie syndrome - Neuromuscular disorders - Medications - **Gynecological** - Endometriosis - Ovarian torsion or masses - **Vascular** - Mesenteric ischemia - Strangulated obstruction - **Metabolic and systemic** - Electrolyte imbalances - Diabetes mellitus - **Infectious** - Tuberculosis - Intraabdominal abscesses - **Pediatric-specific** - Malrotation with volvulus - Meckel diverticulum - Congenital atresia or stenosis ## Surgical Oncology Neoplasms involving the peritoneal cavity, whether primary or metastatic and benign or malignant, represent a significant cause of SBO. The surgical and oncological management of such cases is
