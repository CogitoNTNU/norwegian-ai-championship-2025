for clopidogrel is 300 to 600 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day. Prasugrel, 60 mg loading dose, and 10 mg per day of a maintenance dose have a faster onset when compared to clopidogrel.[19] Patients undergoing PCI should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor and a parenteral anticoagulant. In PCI, the use of prasugrel or ticagrelor is found to be superior to clopidogrel. Aspirin and clopidogrel are also found to decrease the number of ischemic events in NSTEMI and UA.[17] The anticoagulants used during PCI are unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and bivalirudin. The bivalirudin is recommended during primary PCI if the patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.[19] **Long-Term Management** _Lipid-lowering treatment:_ It is recommended to start high-intensity statins that reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. High-density lipoproteins are found to be protective.[19] _Antithrombotic therapy:_ Aspirin is recommended lifelong, and the addition of another agent depends on the therapeutic procedure done, such as PCI with stent placement. ACE inhibitors are recommended in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, or heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes. Beta-blockers are recommended in patients with LVEF less than 40% if no other contraindications are present. Antihypertensive therapy can maintain a blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy is recommended in a patient with left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF less than 40%). Glucose lowering therapy in people with diabetes to achieve current blood sugar goals. [19] **Lifestyle Modifications** _Smoking cessation_ is the most cost-effective secondary measure to prevent MI. Smoking has a pro-thrombotic effect, which has a strong association with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.[6] _Diet, alcohol, and weight control:_ A diet low in saturated fat with a focus on whole grain products, vegetables, fruits, and the fish is considered cardioprotective. The target level for bodyweight is body mass index of 20 to 25 kg/m2 and waist circumference of \<94 cm for the men and \<80 cm for the female.[25] ## Differential Diagnosis 1. Angina pectoris 1. Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 1. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 1. Pulmonary embolism 1. Pneumothorax ## Prognosis Despite many advances in treatment, acute MI still carries a mortality rate of 5-30%; the majority of deaths occur prior to arrival to the hospital. In addition, within the first year after an MI, there is an additional mortality rate of 5% to 12%. The overall prognosis depends on
