aVR, and aVF and are named RA, LA, RL, and LL. The limb leads are color-coded to avoid misplacement (red - right arm, yellow - left arm, green - left leg, and black - right leg). The precordial leads V1 to V6 are attached to the surface of the chest.[22] For the correct location, the "angle of Louis" method is an option, and the exact placement is as follows: - V1 is placed to the right of the sternal border, and V2 is situated to the left of the sternal edge. - V4 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. V4 should be placed before V3. V3 is placed between V2 and V4. - V5 is placed directly between V4 and V6. - V6 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line. - V4 through V6 should line up horizontally along with the fifth intercostal space. ## Complications An electrocardiogram is a safe, non-invasive, painless test with no major risks or complications. An allergic reaction or skin sensitivity to the adhesive gel can occur and usually resolves as soon as the electrode patches are removed and, in most cases, do not require any treatment. Artifacts and distortions pose serious diagnostic difficulties and may result in an inaccurate interpretation of the ECGs, potentially resulting in an adverse therapeutic intervention.[23][24] There can be a potential for misdiagnosis due to the inadvertent misplacement of ECG leads.[25][26] ## Clinical Significance The goal of the electrocardiogram interpretation is to determine whether the ECG waves and intervals are normal or pathological. Electrical signal interpretation gives a good approximation of heart pathology. A standard 12 lead ECG is shown in [Figure 1]. The best way to interpret an ECG is to read it systematically: **Rate** For the calculation of rate, the number of either small or large squares between an R-R interval should be calculated. The rate can be calculated by either dividing 300 by the number of big squares or 1500 by the number of small squares between two R waves. For an irregular rhythm, count the number of beats in a 10-second strip and multiply it by 6.[27] Normal HR is 60 to 99 beats per minute. If it is less than 60, it is called bradycardia, and if greater than 100/min, it is referred to as tachycardia. **Rhythm** The leads I,
