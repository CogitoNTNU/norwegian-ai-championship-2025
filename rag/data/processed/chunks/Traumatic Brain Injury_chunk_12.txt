treat conditions of the nervous system and may coordinate the care of brain trauma and long-term sequelae. Neurosurgeons determine the need for surgical intervention and perform such interventions as indicated. Neuropsychologists may conduct more extensive cognitive testing and aid in assessing the patient's ability to manage their financial, legal, and medical decisions. If any pharmaceutical therapy plays a role in management, pharmacists are vital to evaluating dosing, drug interactions, and counsel regarding potential adverse effects. A coordinated interprofessional team effort is essential in the diagnosis and management of brain trauma injuries, and only through this approach can patient outcomes achieve their optimal results. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22607&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22607) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/neurology/closed-head-trauma/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22607) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22607/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22607) [![Image ](/books/NBK557861/bin/avm.gif)](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Head CT, Intraventricular and Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage From Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Image ](/books/NBK557861/bin/SDH__tentorium.gif)](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Head CT, Subdural Hematoma Tentorium Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Brain Trauma Computed Tomography](/books/NBK557861/bin/Brain_trauma_CT.gif)](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f3/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f3/?report=objectonly) Brain Trauma Computed Tomography.
