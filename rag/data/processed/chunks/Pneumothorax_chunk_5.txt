and effective as tube thoracostomy in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.[37] A recent randomized clinical trial involving unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax revealed that conservative observation was not inferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events compared to invasive techniques.[38] These patients may require hospital admission for observation. Although oxygen therapy with serial chest radiographs is sometimes used, there are limited supporting data.[39] Importantly, positive pressure-generating therapies, such as noninvasive ventilation or high nasal flow nasal cannula, should not be used due to the risk of air leaks and worsening pneumothorax.[40] For secondary secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation or needle aspiration is typically insufficient. These cases require hospital admission and chest tube insertion (ranging from 20 to 28 French), which is typically connected to a water-seal device with or without additional suctioning.[41] **Management of Unstable Patients** Patients with traumatic or tension pneumothorax require emergent thoracostomy or chest tube placement.[42] In most cases, non-tension pneumothorax can be effectively managed with small-bore pigtail catheters inserted using the Seldinger technique. Very large pneumothoraces may necessitate large-bore chest tubes.[43] A thoracostomy with a large-bore chest tube insertion is necessary if there is a concomitant hemothorax. Studies have shown that simple aspiration has a higher failure rate compared to chest tube drainage when used as the initial management strategy for complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases.[44] As a result, chest tube placement is often preferred in patients with large or recurrent pneumothoraces to ensure adequate lung reexpansion and reduce the risk of early recurrence. **Air Drainage Techniques** Air drainage techniques are essential in managing pneumothorax. These techniques help remove air from the pleural space, facilitate lung reexpansion, and prevent recurrence. The choice of technique depends on the size of the pneumothorax, the patient's clinical stability, and the underlying etiology. - Needle aspiration technique: A large-bore (14-gauge) needle approximately 10 cm long can be inserted at one of 2 locations (see **Image.** Chest Wall Decompression.) - Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, above the superior edge of the third rib - Fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, above the upper border of the sixth rib This placement method aims to prevent injury to the neurovascular bundle, which runs along the inferior edge of each rib.[45] - Large-bore catheter drainage technique: For cases requiring large-bore catheter drainage, an 8.3-French pigtail catheter can be introduced into the pleural cavity using ultrasound.
