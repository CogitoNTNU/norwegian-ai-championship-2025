cesarean delivery is recommended.[2][11] - **Maternal resuscitation** : The maternal-fetal condition should be stabilized before proceeding with delivery. Following stabilization, fetal heart rate and uterine activity typically normalize.[2][11] - **Antenatal steroids** : A full course of corticosteroids should be administered in pregnancies less than 34 weeks gestation for fetal lung maturation; delivery should not be delayed to complete the steroid course if the maternal-fetal condition begins to deteriorate.[2] - **Postpartum monitoring** : In the postpartum period, seizures most commonly occur in the first 48 hours following delivery, and the seizure risk remains elevated during the first postpartum week. Due to this and the increased risk of seizure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinicians should continue monitoring patients frequently during the postpartum period.[1] Clinical features of pulmonary edema should be especially looked for in patients with renal dysfunction due to the increased risk of this complication. Adjust antihypertensive treatment accordingly to prevent further complications.[2][11] - **Transfer and Tertiary Care** - **Transfer to appropriate facilities** : Patients with severe eclampsia should be managed in a facility with intensive and neonatal care units, particularly for those remote from term. Blood pressure and seizures should be controlled before transfer.[10] - **Ambulance Transfer** : Transfer should be done with appropriate medical personnel and fetal monitoring to manage any recurrent seizures during transit.[11] ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses should be considered when evaluating patients who have had a seizure, particularly in those with atypical presentations (eg, normal blood pressure without proteinuria, focal neurological symptoms, onset occurring before 20 weeks of pregnancy or more than 48 hours postpartum, or extended period of unconsciousness).[11] Alternative potential diagnoses should be based on the patientâ€™s history and physical exam findings. Differential diagnoses to consider include: - Seizure disorders - Metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia) - Cerebral venous thrombosis - Space-occupying brain lesions - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome - Infectious meningitis or encephalitis - Chronic renal or hepatic disease - Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures - Antiphospholipid syndrome - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome - Amniotic fluid emboli - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - Toxins - Ruptured aneurysm - Intracranial hemorrhage [11] ## Prognosis Patients who have experienced eclampsia are at a higher risk of developing preeclampsia in future pregnancies, with a recurrence rate of approximately 25% for preeclampsia and 2% for eclampsia, especially if eclampsia occurred in the second trimester. Patients with eclampsia are associated with a 12-fold increased risk of
