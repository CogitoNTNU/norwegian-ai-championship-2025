5 years, present with infrequent seizures (focal or generalized) and stagnation or regression of the development. Within 2 to 3 years of the onset of symptoms, further developmental regression occurs in association with more frequent generalized seizures, such as atonic or atypical absence seizures. Most children have normal development before disease onset, but developmental delay and cognitive impairment may be present from the beginning, depending on the underlying etiologies.[14] Rarely, neurocognitive regression may appear as the earliest feature without evidence of clinical seizures. Behavioral abnormalities, particularly hyperactivity, are commonly present with ESES.[15] ## Evaluation ESES is diagnosed by demonstrating bilateral, or rarely, unilateral, continuous or near-continuous slow (1.5 to 3 Hz), diffuse, or bilateral spike-wave discharges during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.[2] During wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep, only intermittent focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges or slow waves are present; an inadequate sampling of EEG during NREM sleep may entirely miss the diagnosis.[2] Sporadic frontotemporal or centrotemporal interictal epileptiform discharges during wakefulness become significantly activated during sleep, disrupting the typical sleep background. There is controversy concerning the minimum threshold of spike-wave activity during NREM sleep for a formal diagnosis of ESES. Different study results have quoted a widely variable range of 25% to 85%, but most commonly, 85% or 50% spike-wave index thresholds have been accepted for diagnosis of ESES.[3] ## Treatment / Management Due to a lack of randomized controlled studies, current treatment options are primarily based on retrospective studies and expert opinions. The treatment goal—suppression of the EEG abnormalities, improvement of the seizure control, amelioration of the behavioral abnormalities, and reversal of cognitive regression—must be established at the time of the diagnosis. The existing treatment paradigm has its basis in uncontrolled studies and case series and primarily focuses on the use of traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including benzodiazepines and corticosteroids, epilepsy surgery, and other nonpharmacologic therapies such as the administration of IVIG or a ketogenic diet. The most common AEDs used for ESES include valproate, ethosuximide, and levetiracetam.[16] In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, researchers noted that levetiracetam decreased the spike-wave index to 37 (mean) from a baseline of 56 (mean) at the end of the treatment period (_P_ < 0.0002).[17] Rarely, ethosuximide and sulthiame have been reported to improve ESES as a monotherapy, but as adjunctive and combination therapy, both have had extensive use. Although valproate has not been associated with worsening seizures in ESES, the
