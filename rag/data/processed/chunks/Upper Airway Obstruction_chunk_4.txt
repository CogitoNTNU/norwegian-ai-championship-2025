to intubate the patient. If orotracheal intubation fails, then a surgical airway is required. Performing an emergency tracheostomy in the emergency department or at the bedside requires a great deal of skill and knowledge of the neck anatomy; it should not be attempted by anyone who has never done a formal tracheostomy in the operating room. Irrespective of how a patent airway is obtained, the patient does need monitoring in the ICU overnight. ICU nurses should be familiar with monitoring of intubated patients and communicate with the team if there are issues with oxygenation or ventilation Some patients may require PEEP and corticosteroids to reduce the swelling from traumatic intubation. Imaging studies, arterial blood gas, and a clinical exam are needed frequently during admission. [9][10] **Outcomes** The outcomes for patients with airway obstruction depend on the cause. If the cause is a foreign body that has been removed, the outcomes are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310) [![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly) First aid technique for clearing the airways. 1.
