procalcitonin, both acute-phase proteins, may be helpful in distinguishing viral from bacterial sepsis, with the latter showing steeper elevations in these proteins. A complete chemistry panel with liver function tests, a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel, and an arterial blood gas are additional labs that may provide important information on the severity of sepsis syndrome in a patient. At least two sets of blood cultures are recommended prior to administration of antibiotics. However, less than 40% of blood cultures are positive. A chest x-ray may reveal signs of pneumonia or ARDS. Plain X-rays of the extremities may reveal the presence of gas in tissues if the patient has necrotizing fasciitis. Ultrasound may be used to evaluate the gallbladder. CT scan is used to assess the abdomen for abscess, bowel perforation, or ischemia. ## Treatment / Management The below guidelines are derived from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines [17][18] **Source Control** 1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis for all patients. Initial empiric anti-infective therapy should have activity against all likely pathogens and adequate penetration of source tissue. 1. Removal of infected/necrotic tissue if it is the source of septic shock, ie, patients with cellulitis, abscess, infected devices, or purulent wounds. **Management of Shock** [19] 1. Measures are most effective if achieved within the first six hours of diagnosis. 1. Restore central venous pressure (CVP) to 8 mmHg to 12 mm Hg 1. Restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mm Hg 1. Restore superior vena cava saturation to 70% or mixed venous saturation to 65% 1. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (NS or albumin) and colloid (blood products) up to 80 ml/kg 1. Mechanical ventilation to reduce metabolic demand 1. First-line vasoactive agents (epinephrine in cold shock versus norepinephrine in warm shock) when fluid-refractoryNote: dopamine as a first-line agent has fallen out of favor given its inhibitory effect on the HPA axis, namely prolactin and growth hormone, which can confer immunologic dysfunction [20] **Enhancing Host Response** 1. Corticosteroids indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock and or in patients with low (unstimulated) basal cortisol levels less than 150 Î¼g/L) [21][22] 1. Addition of vasopressin indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock While central lines are not required for the resuscitation of patients with septic shock, they provide an accurate means of monitoring CVP and mixed venous oxygen. Remember that CVP and MVO2 are most accurate from a central line that lies within the right atrium;
