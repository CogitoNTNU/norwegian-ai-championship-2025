cancers. - Mesothelioma: An important differential to consider, especially in patients with a history of exposure to carcinogenic agents, such as asbestos. - Infradiaphragmatic: - Conditions such as pancreatitis, peritonitis, bilothorax due to biliopleural fistula or bile duct obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, intraabdominal abscess, and postendoscopic esophageal sclerotherapy are notable causes. - Meigs syndrome: Characterized by pleural effusion and ascites in the presence of pelvic tumors. - Autoimmune: Various autoimmune conditions can lead to exudative effusions. - Drugs: Certain medications may induce pleural effusion. - Post-operative: Surgical procedures can result in exudative effusions, such as chylothorax and hemothorax. - Other: Includes amyloidosis, esophageal rupture, and benign asbestos-related effusion. A thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate use of imaging and laboratory tests can differentiate pleural effusion from these conditions. ## Prognosis Limited data regarding the prognostic factors associated with pleural effusion are available. Although it is already established that individuals with malignant effusions carry a dismal prognosis, the mortality rate for those with nonmalignant effusions has not been extensively studied.[22][23][22] Nevertheless, several prospective studies have indicated that effusion is a potential indicator of increased mortality.[3][24] ## Complications Pleural effusion, although often manageable, can lead to various complications. One such complication is empyema, characterized by accumulated infected fluid within the pleural space. Empyema can result in systemic infection, sepsis, and respiratory compromise, necessitating aggressive treatment with antibiotics and, in severe cases, drainage procedures such as thoracentesis or CTT insertion. Another potential complication of pleural effusion is pleural thickening from fibrous adhesions, which can occur due to chronic inflammation or repeated effusion episodes. Pleural thickening can lead to decreased lung expansion, impaired respiratory function, and restrictive lung disease. Although pulmonary rehabilitation or corticosteroids may suffice for some patients, others may require surgical intervention, such as thoracoscopic or open decortication, to remove fibrous tissue and release adhesions, thereby improving lung expansion and respiratory function. ## Consultations The following consultations are recommended: - Pulmonology: To assess the severity of pleural effusion, determine treatment options, and coordinate care with other team members. - Thoracic surgery: To perform surgical procedures involving the chest, including interventions that address complicated pleural effusion. These medical specialists can help provide comprehensive care tailored to the patient's requirements. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Primary preventive measures for pleural effusion involve preventing the development of conditions that can lead to its occurrence. These preventive actions include engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy
