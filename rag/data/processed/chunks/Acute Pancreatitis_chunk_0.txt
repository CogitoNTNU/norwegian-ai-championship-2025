The severity of the disease varies widely, from mild disease needing conservative treatment to severe and complicated disease with high morbidity and mortality. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia. The occurrence rate of each acute pancreatitis etiology varies across geographic regions and socioeconomic strata. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute pancreatitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify a patient presentation consistent with acute pancreatitis. - Assess how to use the Revised Atlanta Classification to diagnose pancreatitis. - Evaluate the treatment strategy for acute pancreatitis. - Communicate the roles of interprofessional team members in both the prevention of and management of patients with acute pancreatitis.

It involves the acute inflammation of the pancreas. The severity of acute pancreatitis varies widely, from mild conditions needing conservative treatment to severe and complicated diseases with high morbidity and mortality. The mortality of acute pancreas ranges from 3% in patients with mild edematous pancreatitis to as high as 20% in patients with pancreatic necrosis.[1] The diagnosis of acute presentation is simple, but the major challenge is predicting the progression of the disease course and outcome. The duration of the disease is essential in determining the level of care.[2][3][4] The Atlanta classification broadly classifies acute pancreatitis into 2 categories: - Interstitial edematous acute pancreatitis is characterized by the acute inflammation of the pancreatic parenchyma and surrounding peri-pancreatic tissue. - Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is characterized by necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma and peri-pancreatic tissue.[5] Based on the severity of the disease, acute pancreatitis is divided into the following types; - In mild acute pancreatitis, local or systemic complications and organ failure are absent. - In moderately severe acute pancreatitis, there are local complications
