the patient presents with.[58] The chest x-ray may show a mild infiltrative process with hilar adenopathy.[29] On computed tomography (CT) imaging, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodule formation, ground glass attenuation, and consolidation may be more evident in atypical bacterial pneumonia compared to typical bacterial pneumonia.[59] Atypical bacterial pneumonia is less commonly associated with lobar consolidations and complicated parenchymal findings such as empyema. Severe manifestations may still occur with the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome and alveolar hemorrhage should still be considered in the critically unwell patient.[60][61] Bedside ultrasonography can potentially differentiate between atypical bacterial pneumonia and viral causes through the higher detection of dynamic air bronchograms in up to 71.4% of cases. ## Treatment / Management Atypical organisms such as _M. pneumoniae_ , _C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species lack cell walls; therefore, beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy is not recommended.[1] If the treating clinician suspects atypical bacterial pneumonia, empirical treatment may be warranted before further investigations, depending on the severity of illness in the patient. In more severe cases, investigations outlined in evaluating atypical bacterial pneumonia patients should be conducted to exclude other infectious causes, assess severity and microbiological burden, and guide antibiotic rationalization and stewardship practices. In moderate-to-severe cases, empirical antibiotics should be started within 4 hours and ideally as soon as possible in the setting of sepsis to reduce the risk of deterioration.[62] First-line treatment for atypical bacterial pneumonia typically involves the macrolide family of antibiotics, although resistance is emerging.[63][64] Azithromycin is the most common and is available in intravenous and oral formulations with similar bioavailability; the short treatment course of 3 to 5 days (500 mg on the first day, 250 mg subsequently) is tolerable in many patients and efficacious for mild-to-moderate disease.[9] Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily is an alternative to azithromycin. Other outpatient antibiotics include fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily in the United States) and tetracycline (doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 5-7 days). However, guidelines often differ in their use based on local dispositions.[65] For hospitalized patients with more severe cases, macrolides are often combined with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, depending on the severity of illness, to cover a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, intravenous fluoroquinolone monotherapy has been considered in some jurisdictions.[3][64] In these instances, close cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades
