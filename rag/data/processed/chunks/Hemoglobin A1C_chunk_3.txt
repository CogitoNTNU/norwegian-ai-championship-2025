transfusion, erythropoietin administration, iron supplementation, hemolytic anemia, chronic kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, sickle cell anemia, and spherocytosis. Vitamin C supplementation can increase or decrease HbA1c levels depending on the method used.[23][24] Conversely, a falsely high HbA1c value can be due to insufficient iron in the blood. This condition can result from iron deficiency anemia, infection-induced or tumor-induced anemia. In addition, hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and B12 deficiency can cause a falsely high HbA1c value.[25][26] Other causes of falsely high HbA1c levels include hypertriglyceridemia, organ transplantation, and hyperglycation in certain ethnic groups. Medications such as immunosuppressants and protease inhibitors can sometimes lead to a falsely high HbA1c value.[22][27][28] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings The HbA1c percentage reflects the average glucose level in a patient's body over the past 90 days.[29][30][31] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK549816/table/article-22729.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK549816/table/article-22729.table0/?report=objectonly) Table. Relationship Between HbA1c and Average Glucose Levels. ## Clinical Significance HbA1c is a well-established marker that reflects average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months and serves as a reliable indicator of long-term glycemic control.[2] HbA1c\*\*\*\* is widely used not only for monitoring diabetes mellitus but also as a diagnostic tool and an alternative to glucose testing for screening diabetes mellitus. Glycated hemoglobin has been firmly recognized as a predictor of the risk of developing microvascular complications, such as retinopathy and nephropathy, in patients with diabetes mellitus.[32][33] Notably, the absolute risks of these complications are directly proportional to the mean HbA1c concentration. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of diabetic retinopathy increases continuously with rising HbA1c levels, and a single HbA1c measurement can predict the progression of retinopathy even 4 years later.[2][34] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety The laboratory must develop, document, implement, and maintain a comprehensive quality management system to ensure all processes adhere to established quality standards and consistently deliver reliable results.[35] For HbA1c testing, both internal and external quality control are vital elements of this system, directly contributing to the accuracy and consistency of reported outcomes.[36] Internal quality control focuses on monitoring the analytical phase of the testing process. According to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments guidelines, a minimum of 2 quality control levels must be performed every 24 hours for routine laboratory assays. Although manufacturers provide control ranges, laboratories are encouraged to define them based on internal data and relevant guidelines to optimize performance.[37] Quality control results should be charted using Levey-Jennings plots, with appropriate Westgard rules applied.
