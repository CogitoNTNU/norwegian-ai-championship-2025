brain. The opiates most commonly involved in adults experiencing seizures are propoxyphene and meperidine. Hearing loss may occur in rare cases, particularly in individuals who have consumed alcohol with heroin. However, this auditory deficit is usually reversible. ## Evaluation Opiate overdose or toxicity must always be considered in patients presenting with lethargy of an unknown cause. Many individuals who abuse opiates may concurrently use other illicit substances, such as cocaine, or prescription drugs, like antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Suspicion of coingestants should be raised when the usual clinical signs and symptoms of opiate toxicity are absent and the patient does not respond to the opiate antagonist naloxone.[24][25][26][27] **Laboratory Studies** Laboratory studies are often conducted for patients with drug overdoses. Drug screens are widely available but may not significantly affect initial management due to the high potential for false positives and negatives. In patients with opiate toxicity or overdose, the following blood work is usually performed: - Complete blood cell count - Comprehensive metabolic panel - Creatine kinase level - Arterial blood gas determinations - Pregnancy testing - Acetaminophen and salicylate testing **Imaging Studies** A chest x-ray should be obtained if lung injury is suspected. An abdominal x-ray or computed tomography should be obtained if the patient is possibly a body packer. **Electrocardiography** Electrocardiography (ECG) is recommended in all patients with suspected opioid overdose. Coingestants like tricyclics have the potential to cause arrhythmias. ## Treatment / Management **Prehospital Management** Often, the first responder at the scene of a suspected opioid overdose is a nonmedical individual, such as a police officer. As of 2016, over 1,214 law enforcement agencies have trained their officers to administer naloxone in the field. This community involvement has led to increased survival rates following overdose incidents in the Midwest United States.[28] Emergency medical technicians must be aware of prearrival naloxone administration by law enforcement and its effects. In some cases, patients may experience a complete reversal of toxicity and refuse further medical care or transportation to an emergency department. Studies have shown low short-term mortality rates in these cases. However, the potential risks of recurrent toxicity must be explained to these individuals, as well as the associated morbidity and mortality.[29][30] If EMS are the first responders, priority should be given to assessing airway and hemodynamic stability. Naloxone should be administered in cases of decreased respirations. If the individual has no intravenous access, naloxone may be given intramuscularly, intranasally,
