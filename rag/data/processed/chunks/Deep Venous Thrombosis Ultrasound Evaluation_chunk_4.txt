combination, to accurately diagnose or exclude thrombosis.[30] **History** - Pain (50% of patients) - Redness - Swelling (70% of patients) **Physical Examination** - Limb edema (may be unilateral or bilateral if the thrombus extends to pelvic veins) - Red and hot skin with dilated veins - Tenderness ## Evaluation The following veins are categorized as deep veins according to the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification: 1. inferior vena cava, 2. common iliac, 3. internal and external iliac, 4. pelvic veins, including a. gonadal, and b. broad ligament veins, 5. common femoral, 6. deep femoral vein, 7. femoral, 8. popliteal, 9. paired crural veins of anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal, 10. muscular veins of gastrocnemial, and soleal.[31] As per the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines following investigations are done: - D-dimers (very sensitive but not very specific) - Coagulation profile - Proximal leg vein ultrasound, which, when positive, indicates that the patient should be treated as having a DVT Deciding how to investigate is determined by the risk of DVT. The first step is to assess the clinical probability of a DVT using the Wells scoring system. - The clinical probability is low for patients with a score of 0 to 1, but for those with two or above, the clinical probability is high. - If a patient scores 2 or above, either a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be done within 4 hours, and if the result is negative, a D-dimer test should be done. If imaging is not possible within 4 hours, a D-dimer test should be undertaken, and an interim 24-hour dose of a parenteral anticoagulant should be given. A proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 24 hours of being requested. - In the case of a positive D-dimer test and a negative proximal leg vein ultrasound scan, the proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be repeated 6 to 8 days later for all patients. - If the patient does not score 2 on the DVT Wells score, but the D-dimer test is positive, the patient should have a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan within 4 hours, or if this is not possible, the patient should receive an interim 24-hour dose of a parenteral anticoagulant. A proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 24 hours of being requested. - In all patients diagnosed with DVT, treat as if there is
