stressors such as pain or anxiety activate medullary cells, triggering monocytopoiesis and the release of myeloid progenitor cells. The spleen is also activated to replenish proinflammatory cells, which then mobilize to the damaged myocardium. There, the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) further enhances the recruitment of inflammatory cells. This exaggerated inflammatory response to viral-induced myocardial damage contributes to chronic inflammation, myocardial remodeling, and eventual ventricular dysfunction.[6] In the innate immune response, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are the first to infiltrate the myocardium. Toll-like receptors on these immune cells recognize viral components, amplifying the inflammatory response. Natural killer cells are crucial in eliminating infected cells, setting the stage for the adaptive immune phase. In the adaptive immune phase, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells target viral peptides on infected myocytes, thereby inducing cell death. CD4+ helper T cells enhance the immune response by producing cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. B cells produce antibodies against viral antigens but can also generate autoantibodies targeting self-antigens through a process known as molecular mimicry. This phenomenon occurs when viral antigens closely resemble cardiac proteins, such as myosin, leading to autoimmune myocarditis. In the chronic phase, even after viral clearance, immune cells may continue to attack the heart due to the persistence of autoantigens. This prolonged inflammation causes myocyte necrosis, followed by fibrosis, and ultimately results in dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] ## History and Physical The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild viral illness to fulminant heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or sudden cardiac death. The onset can be acute or insidious, and there are no pathognomonic symptoms specific to the condition. The classic triad includes chest pain, arrhythmias, and signs of heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Common symptoms may include fever, malaise, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, presyncope, and syncope. Chest pain may either mimic pericarditis—particularly in cases of myopericarditis, which occurs in at least 35% of patients—or resemble the central, severe discomfort characteristic of acute coronary syndrome. A preceding acute febrile illness, often respiratory or gastrointestinal in origin, is reported in approximately 60% of cases. Clinicians should also inquire about a history of prior myocarditis, autoimmune disorders, family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death, and recent exposure to cardiotoxic agents. Fulminant presentations may resemble acute decompensated heart failure, characterized by respiratory distress, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope, hemodynamic instability, and potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
