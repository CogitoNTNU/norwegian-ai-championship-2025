distention. The gallbladder wall develops an inflammatory reaction, characterized by significant thickening and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Prolonged biliary stasis can lead to bacterial colonization, contributing to the inflammatory response. If the pressure is not relieved promptly, the gallbladder wall loses its primary source of blood supply from the cystic artery, which is prone to ischemia.[12] Progressive gallbladder wall ischemia will result in necrotic or gangrenous changes. A necrotic gallbladder wall will eventually perforate and stimulate a systemic inflammatory response, followed by sepsis and shock. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis usually presents more insidiously. Symptoms are more prolonged and may be less severe. Symptoms may also be more intermittent and vague, although patients can present with signs of acute biliary colic.[9][13] Although acute acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with critical illness, several mechanisms have been reported in patients without critical illness, including gallbladder vasculitis, biliary tree obstruction, and bile acid sequestration.[11] **Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis** **Types** Acute acalculous cholecystitis can be divided into the following 4 types: 1. Uncomplicated cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation without necrosis or perforation) 1. Acute suppurative cholecystitis (an inflamed gallbladder with associated purulence) 1. Gangrenous cholecystitis (gallbladder wall necrosis) 1. Perforated cholecystitis (gallbladder wall rupture) [14] ## Histopathology Acute acalculous cholecystitis may present with varying degrees of inflammation, and the findings are similar to those of calculus cholecystitis but without gallstones. The gallbladder wall will be thickened to variable degrees, and there may be adhesions to the serosal surface. Smooth muscle hypertrophy, especially in chronic conditions, is often present. At times, sludge or viscous bile can be seen. These findings can be precursors to gallstone formation due to increased bile salts or stasis. Various species of bacteria can be present in 11% to 30% of cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, also known as adenomyomatosis, are often present in specimens of chronic cholecystitis. These are herniations of intraluminal sinuses from increased intraluminal pressure, possibly associated with ducts of Luschka, which are small aberrant bile ducts found along the gallbladder fossa. The gallbladder mucosa will exhibit varying degrees of inflammation, from mild to moderate ulcerations with gangrenous changes. Extreme situations may show total gangrenous changes of the gallbladder with perforation.[15] ## Toxicokinetics Mild cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis are usually only treated for symptoms of biliary colic, but more severe cases can lead to sepsis and shock. The pressurized, static intraluminal bile can be susceptible to bacterial seeding. Antibiotics are usually ineffective because
