help prevent further decompensation and progression of symptoms.[7][8] - **Coronary revascularization:** When performed in appropriately selected patients, revascularization can reduce mortality and morbidity by improving diastolic and systolic dysfunction. According to the AHAs 2013 congestive heart failure guidelines, coronary artery revascularization may be indicated as an intervention for heart failure patients with angina, left ventricle dysfunction, and CAD. Interventional cardiology should be consulted early for patients according to AHA recommendations.[2][6] - **Admission to inpatient service for further treatment and evaluation:** Patients being treated for flash pulmonary edema should be admitted to the hospital with the level of monitoring and care appropriate for each case. For select patients with acute decompensated heart failure, it may be possible to treat them at home, depending on the severity of symptoms.[9] **The Medical Management of Heart Failureâ€“Risk Factor Modification and Prevention of Acute Decompensation** While acute decompensated heart failure and flash pulmonary edema can be dramatic and require intensive care and aggressive therapy, the main focus of heart failure management is on helping prevent the progression of the disease and mitigate episodes of acute exacerbation. Medical practitioners often use the American Heart Association and the New York Heart Association stages of heart failure to guide the evidence-based treatment of heart failure. Treatment of early stages of chronic heart failure usually focuses on risk factor modification, and as the disease process progresses, it starts to include more aggressive interventions. - Risk factor modification - Dietary and lifestyle changes, such as decreased salt intake, reduced obesity, and smoking cessation - Tighter control and management of hypertension, diabetes dyslipidemia, and other chronic diseases that can exacerbate CHF - More aggressive intervention for those with a higher degree of CHF - Echocardiography for patients with a higher risk of left ventricular ejection fraction reduction - Implantable cardiac defibrillator placement, when indicated in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy at high risk of sudden death For further information on the medical management of chronic heart failure, please refer to the American Heart Association and New York Heart Association guidelines.[1][2][1][6] **Advanced Treatment Strategies for End-Stage Congestive Heart Failure** For select patients with end-stage heart failure, which is refractory to other treatment strategies, the option of mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation should be considered. In mechanical circulatory support, for example, a left ventricular assist device is often used as a bridge therapy until a heart transplant is available. In certain situations, mechanical
