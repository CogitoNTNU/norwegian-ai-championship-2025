This condition is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among the elderly, and is often associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. The increasing prevalence of heart failure is driven by the aging population and improved survival rates from cardiovascular conditions. Early detection and appropriate management are crucial in reducing hospitalizations and improving the quality of life for patients. In this course, healthcare professionals enhance their competence in recognizing and managing heart failure and pulmonary edema. They learn to assess symptoms accurately, utilize diagnostic tools like echocardiography, and apply treatment strategies, including diuretics, vasodilators, and beta-blockers. Collaboration with an interprofessional team, including cardiologists, nurses, and pharmacists, ensures comprehensive care is highlighted; this collaboration improves treatment adherence and optimizes patient outcomes by preventing exacerbations and reducing the need for hospital readmissions. **Objectives:** - Identify the early signs and symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. - Differentiate between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction based on clinical and echocardiographic findings. - Screen high-risk individuals, such as those with hypertension or coronary artery disease, for the potential development of heart failure. - Communicate interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment and management of heart failure to improve patient outcomes.

The growing prevalence of heart failure is primarily attributed to an aging population and a rise in risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Healthcare professionals should be familiar with the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of heart failure because of the morbidity, mortality, and projected increased prevalence of the condition.[1][2][3] Heart failure is a clinical syndrome and encompasses a constellation
