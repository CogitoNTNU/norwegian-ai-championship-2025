damaged, their contents are released, causing inflammation and fluid sequestration. The reduction in intravascular volume activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, further compromising renal blood flow. The sympathetic nervous system is also activated, releasing vasopressin, which worsens renal ischemia. The myoglobin released by damaged myocytes is a main contributor to renal injury. The kidney's filtering capacity becomes overwhelmed by excess myoglobin, which then deposits in renal tubules, causing renal toxicity. The myoglobin can also bind oxygen, increasing free radicals and lipid peroxidation, which causes further oxidative damage and renal vasoconstriction. Rhabdomyolysis also leads to increased uric acid production, and the acidosis facilitates myoglobin binding with uromodulin (ie, Tamm-Horsfall protein) to form tubular casts and potentiate further renal injury. Heme also binds nitrous oxide, depleting its concentration and inducing expression of the vasoconstrictors endothelin-1, isoprostanes, and thromboxanes.[3][42] In addition, heme is thought to activate platelets.[43] The risk of AKI is estimated between 10% and 50% when CPK is greater than 1000 U/L.[3] The best predictors for developing AKI appear to be a state of hydration, high initial serum creatine, low serum bicarbonate, low serum calcium, and increased serum phosphate. Hypoalbuminemia and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have also been associated with the development of AKI. **Compartment Syndrome** Trauma of muscle groups in specific compartments can lead to compartment syndrome due to muscle swelling, which further causes additional pressure-related damage like arterial occlusion and muscle necrosis. Persistently raised compartment pressure may lead to irreversible peripheral nerve palsy. Compartment pressure of more than 30 mm Hg produces significant muscle ischemia, and measurement of compartmental pressure is helpful in decision-making for fasciotomy. Patients with rhabdomyolysis, severe blood loss, and hypotension are at increased risk for muscle ischemia, even with lesser compartment pressures.[44] Patients with crush injuries are particularly susceptible to compartment syndrome. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation** The heme protein has the potential to cause many inflammatory actions; it activates platelets, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), induces apoptosis, damages mitochondria, activates inflammasomes, and produces cytokines. Heme is also directly thrombogenic by promoting the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and inducing platelet degranulation, macrophage activation, and tissue factor expression.[42] In an underlying inflammatory and thrombogenic state, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also be due to thromboplastin released during muscle injury.[45][46] Laboratory values will show increased prothrombin time, activated thromboplastin time, INR, and serum D-dimer levels and decreased platelet count and fibrinogen levels. ## Histopathology Muscle biopsy
