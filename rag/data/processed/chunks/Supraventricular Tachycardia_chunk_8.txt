ventricular activation conduction is absent during the VOP maneuver, the results cannot be interpreted. However, the maneuver can be reattempted with some considerations. Each attempt should involve decremental pacing, decreasing the cycle length by 10 to 20 milliseconds after each attempt that demonstrates acceleration in atrial conduction. Additionally, it is essential to confirm that the TCL returns to approximately its original value after pacing is stopped. A pseudo-AAV response occurs when the response is mislabeled, such as selecting an “A” that precedes the actual last “A.” This situation can arise in long RP tachycardias or when isoproterenol increases junctional automaticity. To avoid this error, use calipers to measure the A-A interval and confirm it matches the pacing rate, while carefully identifying the last advanced “A.” Another scenario involves the A-H interval being shorter than the His to ventricle (H-V) interval, indicating that the impulse takes longer to conduct through the His-Purkinje system (ventricular conduction) than through the AV node. This may result from prolonged HV conduction due to conduction disease or a shortened A-H interval. This discrepancy can be addressed by comparing the AHV/AHV response with the AV/AAV response. A summary of electrophysiology laboratory maneuvers used to differentiate between types of SVT is presented in this paper (see **Table.** Electrophysiology Lab Maneuvers for Differentiating Supraventricular Tachycardia). ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the electrophysiology laboratory relies on a well-coordinated, multidisciplinary healthcare team. This team includes physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals, each contributing distinct expertise and perspectives to support patient-centered care. Physicians and advanced practitioners lead the diagnosis and treatment of SVT, utilizing their electrophysiology training, while nurses manage patient preparation, intraprocedural monitoring, and post-procedure recovery. Pharmacists ensure the safe and effective use of medications, guiding dosing and potential drug interactions. Clear communication among the interprofessional healthcare team members is vital for optimizing team performance and patient safety. Standardized communication tools and protocols, such as checklists and handoff templates, help streamline workflows and reduce errors. Regular team meetings and a collaborative problem-solving approach foster a culture of shared responsibility and continuous improvement. This interprofessional approach enhances efficiency, minimizes complications, and improves outcomes for patients undergoing evaluation and treatment for SVT in the electrophysiology laboratory. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=155834&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=155834) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/155834/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=155834) [![Differential Ventricular Pacing Responses](/books/NBK616083/bin/Screenshot__2025-05-24__at__7.19.25xPM.gif)](/books/NBK616083/figure/article-155834.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK616083/figure/article-155834.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Differential Ventricular Pacing
