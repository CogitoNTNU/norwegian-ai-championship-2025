Approximately 50% of patients with NORSE have an unknown etiology despite an extensive workup. There is a lack of consensus regarding the best treatment options available for managing patients with NORSE. However, immediate cessation of seizure activity, early institution of continuous infusion of anesthetic agents, and immunotherapies can play an important role in reducing morbidity and mortality in NORSE. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment options available and highlights the healthcare team's role in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the etiology of new-onset refractory status epilepticus. - Explain the pathophysiology of new-onset refractory status epilepticus. - Outline the typical presentation of a patient with new-onset refractory status epilepticus. - Summarize the treatment considerations for patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus.
