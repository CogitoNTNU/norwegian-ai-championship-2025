of consciousness events deemed syncopal, any event that reduces either cardiac output or peripheral vascular resistance can result in this common outcome. The following are several noncardiac etiologies: **Reflex (Neurogenic)** - _Vasovagal -_ typically preceded by an inciting stressful event such as fear, seeing blood, hearing bad news, emotional stress, or pain - _Situational -_ preceded by a specific action such as sneezing, laughing, coughing, urinating, defecating, eating, or exercise - _Carotid sinus stimulation_ **Orthostatic Hypotension** - _Autonomic dysfunction_ - usually a symptom of another degenerative disease such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia or can be a primary disease on its own; can also occur as a direct result of diabetes, amyloidosis, and spinal cord trauma - _Drug-induced_ - in the setting of diuretics, vasodilating agents, alcohol, antidepressants, or any other medications that reduce cardiac output or vascular resistance. - _Volume depletion_ - traumatic hemorrhage, atraumatic blood loss, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, decreased oral hydration[17] ## Prognosis Patients with easily treatable etiologies of cardiac syncope will generally have a good prognosis with adequate treatment. Patients with advanced heart failure and syncope, however, have a 45% one-year mortality.[6] Patients with cardiac syncope are also more likely to have recurrent syncopal events with an estimated recurrence rate of 33% within 3 years. Recurrent syncope can worsen a patient's quality of life, especially if syncopal events result in broken bones, intracranial bleeds, or other traumatic injuries.[17] ## Complications Although the treatment and diagnostic modalities employed in the management of cardiac syncope are largely targeted at preventing a future sudden cardiac death, syncopal events can have immediate complications. These complications include costs of hospitalizations, treatment, and lost work time, as well as physical injuries related to falling during the syncopal event. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients already taking multiple medications are prone to syncope. Alcohol can also lead to orthostatic hypotension leading to syncope. Patients with cardiac illness should be educated about the symptoms of syncope and when to seek help as cardiac syncope has a high mortality, especially with advanced cardiac illness. ## Pearls and Other Issues - Cardiac syncope is a transient loss of consciousness due to a defect, either structural or electrical, which prevents the generation of enough cardiac output to perfuse the brain adequately. - Cardiac syncope is more common in patients with preexisting cardiac abnormalities or family histories of cardiac defects or sudden death. -
