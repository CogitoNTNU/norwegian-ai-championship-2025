visits, hospitalizations, and mortality due to asthma.[43][44] Additionally, lack of access to healthcare—whether due to difficulties in accessing clinicians or lack of insurance—further exacerbates prognosis-related challenges. The international asthma mortality rate reaches as high as 0.86 deaths per 100,000 persons in certain countries. The overall prognosis is predominantly linked to lung function, with mortality rates 8 times higher among individuals in the bottom 25% of lung function. Several factors contribute to a poorer prognosis, including inadequate asthma management, age 40 or older, a history of more than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking, blood eosinophilia, and FEV1 of 40% to 69% of predicted values ## Complications The complications related to asthma include disease-related complications and adverse effects of glucocorticoids, LTRA, and endotracheal intubation. The following list contains complications associated with asthma: - Decline in lung function - Osteoporosis - Fracture - Infections - Adrenal suppression - Hypertension - Diabetes - Cataract - Peptic ulcer - Sleep disorders - Obstructive sleep apnea - Mood disorders - Cardiac arrest - Glaucoma - Respiratory failure or arrest - Pneumothorax - Aspiration [45] ## Consultations Healthcare professionals should seek consultation with an asthma specialist in pulmonology or allergy when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, the patient's symptoms remain poorly controlled, medication adverse effects become intolerable, or the patient experiences frequent exacerbations. Accessing appropriate specialist care aids in excluding alternate diagnoses, determining the need for additional diagnostic testing, and effectively escalating medical therapy. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patient education plays a pivotal role in the effective management of asthma by clinicians. To deter exacerbations and improve patient outcomes, clinicians should emphasize the importance of adherence to medication regimens, avoidance of triggers, and regular monitoring of symptoms. Educating patients about asthma triggers, such as allergens, air pollution, and tobacco smoke, can empower them to make informed lifestyle choices. Furthermore, clinicians should highlight the significance of having an asthma action plan, which outlines steps to take during worsening symptoms or exacerbations. See the National Heart and Lung Institute's website, "[Asthma Action Plan](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/asthma-action-plan-2020)," for a printable version of an action plan. Patient education should also prioritize the recognition of early warning signs of an asthma attack and prompt seeking of medical attention when necessary. Routine follow-up visits for patients with active asthma are recommended, occurring every one to six months, contingent on the severity of asthma and adequacy of control. During these follow-up visits, clinicians should assess
