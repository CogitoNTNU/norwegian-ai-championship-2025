negative result does not exclude the existence of significant disease with infrequent events. Interpreting and analyzing such extensive ECG data requires expertise and is time-consuming. Holter monitors also do not provide real-time information and delay identifying essential events.[10] **Event Recorders: Loop Recorders and Post-Event Monitors** Event monitors are a suitable option for patients experiencing syncope, near syncope, or infrequent episodes of dizziness occurring weekly to monthly.[11] Traditional post-event recorders are small devices capable of recording a single ECG lead for several minutes. The patient presses a button on the device while holding it to their chest to activate the recording capability. The recorded data can be quickly downloaded, permitting real-time monitoring if the patient promptly performs the download.[12][13] Unlike a Holter monitor, a post-event recorder is unobtrusive and can be comfortably carried in a pocket when not in use; the need for chest wires is eliminated, and everyday activities are easily accomplished. The most significant drawback of post-event recorders is the lack of continuous ECG monitoring; placing the device against the chest makes it challenging to capture brief symptomatic episodes, and asymptomatic events go unrecorded. Additionally, the onset of the episode is not recorded; this impairs accurate diagnosis. External loop recorders address some of these limitations by continuously monitoring the cardiac conduction system, storing the data in a loop memory for 30 days, and actively recording event data when activated by the patient. External loop recorders are indicated monitoring modalities for patients with infrequent nonsyncopal symptoms; syncopal patients cannot activate the monitor when unconscious.[12] When activated, these recorders store data for a fixed period before and after the activation. While external loop recorders and event monitors are effective for frequent symptoms, the correlation between symptoms and ECG abnormalities is low for events that occur less than once monthly. In cases where extended monitoring is necessary, implantable loop recorders may be utilized. These devices are designed to be implanted subcutaneously in the chest wall via a minimally invasive procedure performed without general anesthesia. Implantable loop recorders can record data for up to 3 years, are MRI-compatible, and have low infection and complication rates.[14][15] **Patch Monitor** Patch monitors combine user-friendly features with patient comfort. Patch monitors have an adhesive backing, adhere securely to the skin, and eliminate the need for irritating wires and electrodes. The lightweight and unobtrusive design of most patch monitors permits unrestricted daily activities. Patients can conveniently annotate symptoms
