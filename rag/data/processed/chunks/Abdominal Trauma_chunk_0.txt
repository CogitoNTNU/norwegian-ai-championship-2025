Other rare causes include falls from heights, bicycle injuries, injuries sustained during sporting activities, and industrial accidents. In children, the most common causes are due to motor vehicle injuries and bicycle accidents.[3][4] ## Epidemiology Blunt trauma to the abdomen can occur in people of all ages and is associated with high morbidity. Each year, thousands of patients with blunt abdominal injuries are seen in emergency departments, and this substantially increases the cost of healthcare.[5][6] ## Pathophysiology Blunt abdominal trauma can cause damage to the internal organs, resulting in internal bleeding, cause contusions, or injuries to the bowel, spleen, liver, and intestines. Patients can also present with extra-abdominal injuries, such as extremity injuries. [7][8] ## History and Physical Because the presentation is often not straightforward, the diagnosis can be difficult and often time-consuming. Besides pain, the patient may present with bleeding per rectum, unstable vital signs, and the presence of peritonitis. The physical exam may reveal marks from a lap belt, ecchymosis, abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds,
