Diagnostic Criteria** Wells criteria and Geneva score are scoring systems most commonly used to estimate the pretest probability of having a PE. These systems allow patients with suspected PE to be classified into clinical or pretest probability categories based on which diagnostic tests are chosen and interpreted. **Revised Geneva clinical prediction rule** The following clinical decision rule points are used in the Geneva scoring system (original version)/(simplified version): - Previous PE or DVT: 3/1 - Heart rate - 75 to 94 bpm: 3/1 - ≥95 bpm: 5/2 - Surgery or fracture within the past month: 2/1 - Hemoptysis: 2/1 - Active cancer: 2/1 - Unilateral lower-limb pain: 3/1 - Pain on lower-limb deep palpation and unilateral edema: 4/1 - Age >65 years: 1/1 Using the Geneva criteria, the clinical probability of PE in a patient can be calculated using the following 3- or 2-level scoring systems: - Three-level score - Low: 0 to 3/0 to 1 - Intermediate: 4 to 10/2 to 4 - High: ≥11/≥5 - Two-level score - PE unlikely: 0 to 5/0 to 2 - PE likely: ≥6/≥3 **Wells criteria and modified Wells criteria** The Wells scoring system uses the following criteria: - Clinical symptoms of DVT: 3 - Other diagnoses less likely than pulmonary embolism: 3 - Heart rate >100 bpm: 1.5 - Immobilization for ≥3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks: 1.5 - Previous history of DVT or PE: 1.5 - Hemoptysis: 1 - Malignancy: 1 [61] Using the traditional or modified Wells criteria, the clinical probability of PE in a patient can be calculated using the following scores: - Traditional Wells criteria - High: >6 - Moderate: 2 to 6 - Low: \<2 - Modified Wells criteria - PE likely: >4 - PE unlikely: ≤4 **Pulmonary Embolism Exclusion Criteria** Since PE symptoms are very nonspecific, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) was developed for emergency department patients to select patients with a low likelihood of having PE that diagnostic workup should not be initiated.[62] They constitute variables significantly associated with the absence of PE. The PERC rule contains the following 8 criteria: - Age \<50 years - Heart rate \<100 bpm - Oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥95% - No hemoptysis - No estrogen use - No prior DVT or PE - No unilateral leg swelling - No surgery/trauma requiring hospitalization within the preceding 4 weeks For patients who fulfill all 8 criteria having a
