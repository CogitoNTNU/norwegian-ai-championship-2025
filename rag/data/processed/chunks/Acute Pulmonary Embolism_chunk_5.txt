lift, third heart sound, cyanosis, and shock. In a patient with PE who has tachycardia on presentation and develops sudden bradycardia or a new broad complex tachycardia (with right bundle branch block), clinicians should consider the right ventricular strain and impending shock. PE should be suspected in anyone with hypotension with jugular venous distension when acute myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, or tension pneumothorax has been ruled out.[28] ## Evaluation **Diagnostic Evaluation of Acute Pulmonary Embolus** The diagnosis of an acute PE comprises various laboratory and imaging studies in conjunction with clinical probability scoring systems, such as the Wells and Geneva criteria. **Arterial blood gas analysis** Unexplained hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph should raise clinical suspicion for PE. Widened alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen, respiratory alkalosis, and hypocapnia are common findings on arterial blood gas (ABG) as a pathophysiological response to PE. Notably, respiratory or lactic acidosis is uncommon but can be present in patients with massive PE associated with obstructive shock and respiratory arrest.[29] **Brain natriuretic peptide** Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has limited diagnostic importance in patients suspected of having PE.[30] Right ventricular pressure overload because of acute PE is associated with more myocardial stretch, releasing BNP and N-terminal-proBNP. Thus, the levels of natriuretic peptides in blood reflect the severity of right ventricular dysfunction in acute PE.[31] **Troponin** Serum troponin I is beneficial prognostically but not diagnostically.[32][33] As a marker of right ventricular dysfunction, troponin levels are elevated in 30% to 50% of patients with moderate to large PE and are linked to clinical deterioration and death after PE.[34] **D-dimer** D-dimer levels are elevated in plasma whenever an acute thrombotic process occurs in the body because the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways are activated simultaneously. D-dimer testing has a high negative predictive value; hence, a normal D-dimer level makes acute PE or DVT unlikely.[35] However, since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not used to confirm PE. As many D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their clinical setting. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a diagnostic sensitivity of at least 95%. ELISA can exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with either low or intermediate pretest probability. A negative ELISA D-dimer and low clinical probability can exclude PE in approximately 30% of suspected patients without further testing. The specificity of D-dimer
