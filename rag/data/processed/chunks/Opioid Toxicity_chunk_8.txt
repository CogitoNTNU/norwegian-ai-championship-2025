gathered from family, friends, bystanders, or emergency medical service providers. Pills, empty bottles, needles, syringes, and other drug paraphernalia are often found at the scene. Important details to obtain in the history include the amount of drug ingested, congestion, and time of ingestion. In some cases, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel may administer naloxone in the prehospital setting, which can help confirm the diagnosis of opiate overdose.[20][21][22][23] **Physical Examination** Patients with opiate overdose commonly exhibit lethargy or a depressed level of consciousness. Opiate overdose also leads to respiratory depression, generalized central nervous system (CNS) impairment, and miosis. However, healthcare workers must recognize that miosis is not always present in every patient with opiate overdose, and other causes of CNS and respiratory depression should be considered. Additional signs of opiate overdose include euphoria, drowsiness, altered mental status, fresh needle marks, seizures, and conjunctival injection. **Skin evaluation** Examination of the extremities may reveal needle track marks in individuals who abuse intravenous opiates. Many people with substance use disorders also inject morphine and heroin subcutaneously. In some cases, opium oil may be inhaled, and individuals may have patch marks on their bodies from fentanyl use. Most opiates can trigger the release of histamine, leading to itching, skin flushing, and urticaria. **Pulmonary assessment** In some morphine toxicity cases, respiratory distress and hypoxia may present with pupillary dilation. Additionally, drugs such as meperidine, morphine, propoxyphene, and diphenoxylate/atropine can cause midpoint pupils or frank mydriasis. Breathing is typically impaired in patients with morphine overdose. One may observe shallow breathing, hypopnea, and bradypnea, with a respiratory rate of 4 to 6 breaths per minute. Since opiates may also cause bronchoconstriction, some individuals may present with dyspnea, wheezing, and frothy sputum production. **Cardiovascular examination** Most opiates cause peripheral vasodilation, which can lead to moderate-to-severe hypotension. However, this hypotension may be reversed with changes in body position or fluid administration. Other coingestants must be considered if the hypotension is severe and unresponsive to fluids. **Gastrointestinal evaluation** Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with opiate toxicity. These symptoms occur because opiates can induce gastric aperistalsis and slow down intestinal motility. **Psychiatric features** Opiates are generalized CNS depressants. However, these drugs can also cause anxiety, agitation, depression, dysphoria, hallucinations, nightmares, and paranoia. **Neurological assessment** Opiates can lower the seizure threshold, potentially leading to generalized seizures, particularly in young children. This effect is mainly due to the paradoxical excitation of the
