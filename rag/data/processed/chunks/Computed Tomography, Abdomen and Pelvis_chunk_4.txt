for the safe mobilization of the ureter during surgery when proper exposure from the surrounding structures is crucial. However, the ureter cannot be resected proximally and distally simultaneously, which will overly compromise its blood supply. The ureter's venous and lymphatic drainage mirrors that of the arterial supply. The lymphatic vessels empty into the internal, external, and common iliac nodes.[14] The left ureter's lymphatic drainage courses to the left paraaortic lymph nodes. Lymph drainage of the right ureter is mainly toward the right paracaval and interaortocaval lymph nodes. ## Nerves The exact role of ureteral innervation is unclear, but the motor impulses for ureteral peristalsis originate from the intrinsic smooth muscular pacemaker sites. The minor calyces house the pacemaker sites within the renal collecting system.[15] Preganglionic sympathetic stimulation comes from T10 to L2 fibers.[16] The aorticorenal, superior, and inferior hypogastric autonomic plexuses give rise to the postganglionic fibers. Meanwhile, S2 to S4 sacral pelvic splanchnic nerves provide ureteral parasympathetic innervation. ## Muscles The ureter has 3 layers: the mucosa (innermost layer), muscularis (middle layer), and adventitia (outer layer). Transitional epithelium lines the ureteral mucosa. Keratin is primarily responsible for this layer's waterproof properties. The muscularis is comprised of 2 longitudinal muscle sheets with an intervening circular muscle layer. The circular layer is peristaltic and disappears in the distal ureter segments. Ureteral peristalsis arises from the pacemaker cells within the continuous smooth muscle layer in the minor renal calyces. The adventitia has dense collagen and elastic fibers that house the smaller ureteral vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves. ## Physiologic Variants **Congenital UPJ Obstruction** The ureter is narrowed, kinked, or scarred where the UPJ meets the renal pelvis. A short area of narrowing and fibrosis emerges, but the obstruction is rarely complete. Peristalsis is ineffective at the UPJ obstruction, so the kidney becomes functionally blocked and physically obstructed at this region. Congenital UPJ obstructions in children are twice as common in male individuals as in female persons, with the left side involved twice as often. The incidence of this condition is estimated to be 1 in 1,000 to 1,500. Circular muscle growth disruption and fibrous tissue formation in the UPJ lead to this condition. High insertion of the ureter in the renal pelvis is occasionally a contributing factor, as it causes a sharp angulation at the UPJ. **Accessory Renal Arteries** Accessory or aberrant renal arteries of the kidney's lower pole produce vessels crossing over
