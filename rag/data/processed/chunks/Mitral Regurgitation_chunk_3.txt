and who are at high or are a prohibitive risk for surgery are currently the only subset of patients recommended for catheter management. If untreated, severe MR can lead to fatal sequelae, including heart failure.[21] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table1/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table1/?report=objectonly) Table 2. Stages of Primary Mitral Regurgitation. Several valve hemodynamic criteria are provided for assessing MR, but not all criteria for each category will be present in each patient. Categorization of MR severity as mild, moderate, or severe depends on data quality and integration of these parameters in conjunction with other clinical evidence.[3] **Table 3.** Stages of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table2/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table2/?report=objectonly) Normal mitral valve leaflets, chords, and annulus in a patient with coronary disease or cardiomyopathy No MR jet or small central jet area \<20% left atrium on Doppler Several valve hemodynamic criteria are provided for assessing MR severity, but not all criteria for each category will be present in each patient. Categorization of MR severity as mild, moderate, or severe depends on data quality and integration of these parameters in conjunction with other clinical evidence. The measurement of the proximal iso velocity surface area by 2D TTE in patients with secondary MR underestimates the true ERO because of the crescentic shape of the proximal convergence.[3] Echocardiography is the primary tool used to assess the structure and function of the MV, systolic competence, and nonrestriction during diastole. Various types of mitral valve leaflet motion can indicate the underlying reason for the dysfunction (see **Table 4.** Mitral Valve Pathology Based on Echocardiography).[22] Severe MR is described as having a color flow jet that may be central and large (>6 cm or >30% of the left atrium area) or smaller, if eccentric, encircling the left atrium. Pulmonary vein flow may show systolic blunting or systolic flow reversal, vena contracta width ≥0.5 cm measured in the parasternal long-axis view, a regurgitant volume of ≥45 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction ≥40%, and/or regurgitant orifice area ≥0.30 cm2 according to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.[23] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table3/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table3/?report=objectonly) Table 4. Mitral Valve Pathology Based on Echocardiography. **Preprocedural Anatomical Considerations** Certain conditions must be met to successfully grasp the mitral valve leaflets during transcatheter mitral valve repair. The leaflets must be pliable and noncalcified at the grasping site, and there must be no significant clefts or perforations. The shorter MitraClip clips NT and NTW also require a minimal
