disorders. Sinus Bradycardia Mechanism: Increased vagal tone. It can be physiological in athletes. Signs & Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. It can lead to orthostasis or dizziness if pathological. EKG Findings: Sinus rhythm with an upright P wave in lead II and biphasic in V1. Management: No treatment is required unless pathological with an inadequate heart rate increase with leg raise test. Treat with isoproterenol or pacemaker if no relief. Atrioventricular Blocks Mechanism: Atrial impulses are conducted with a delay or not at all when an electrical impulse reaches a tissue that not excitable or is in a refractory period. a) First Degree AV Block: Caused by increased vagal tone or conduction impairment or due to medications. Signs & Symptoms: Generally asymptomatic but can cause dizziness. EKG Findings: PR interval is greater than 200 milliseconds. Management: Usually, no need to treat. b) Second Degree AV Block: Further classified into Mobitz I block, where there is a progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a skipped beat, and Mobitz II block, where there is a randomly dropped QRS complex on an EKG. Sign & Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, syncope. EKG Findings: Mobitz type I shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex or dropped beat. Mobitz type II has randomly dropped QRS complexes. Management: Pacemaker is indicated in symptomatic Mobitz I and all of Mobitz II heart block. c) Third Degree or complete AV Block Mechanism: Lack of conduction of atrial impulse to ventricle leading to independent contractions. Sign & Symptoms: Profound bradycardia, hypotension, and can lead to asystole and cardiac arrest. EKG Findings: Bradycardia, P waves occur independently of QRS and Wide QRS for ventricular rhythm. Management: Pacemaker placement. **Sinus Node Dysfunction** Mechanism: Senescence of the SA node, an ischemic event involving the SA node leading to impulse generation at a slower rate. a) Sinus Pause: When the SA node has delayed impulse generation. b) Sinus Arrest: Failure of impulse generation. c) SA Nodal Exit Block: Failure of impulse transmission. Sign & Symptoms: Bradycardia, dizziness, palpitation, or syncope. EKG Findings: P wave not originating at a determined rate with regularity Management: Symptomatic patients require pacemaker placement. ## Other Issues **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy** Mechanism: Subaortic outflow tract obstruction from abnormal hypertrophy of the septal region of the heart, leading to precipitation of ventricular arrhythmias. Risk Factor: Autosomal dominant mutation in the gene coding for
