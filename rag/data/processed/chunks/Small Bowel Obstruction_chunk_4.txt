SBO is less common in children and typically results from congenital abnormalities such as malrotation or intussusception. Over the past 4 decades, advancements in imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy, and laparoscopic techniques have significantly altered the management of SBO. Before 1981, surgery was the definitive treatment. Since then, adopting nonoperative protocols has improved patient selection for timely surgical intervention, such as laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Despite these advancements, recurrent SBO remains a concern, with a recurrence rate of 12% to 32% after initial surgical management. Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to complications such as strangulation, bowel ischemia, and sepsisâ€”conditions associated with a mortality rate exceeding 25%. While improved diagnostic modalities have enhanced outcomes in developed nations, delays in care and limited access to advanced surgical techniques remain significant challenges in resource-constrained settings. Understanding the epidemiology of SBO is critical for developing preventive measures, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing the global burden of this condition. ## Pathophysiology SBO results from an interruption in the normal flow of intestinal contents due to a mechanical blockage or functional impairment. This disruption triggers a series of pathological processes affecting the bowel wall, vascular supply, and systemic physiology. These processes can escalate rapidly, especially in cases of strangulation or ischemia, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and intervention. **Mechanical Obstruction** In mechanical SBO, a physical barrier obstructs the bowel lumen, creating a transition point where proximal bowel distention and distal bowel decompression occur. The obstructing lesion prevents the passage of intestinal contents, leading to increased intraluminal pressure proximal to the obstruction. This pressure gradient causes: - Proximal bowel distention - This may induce vomiting as the bowel attempts to relieve pressure. - Distal bowel decompression - This occurs along with inhibition of peristalsis distal to the obstruction, while proximal peristalsis temporarily increases to overcome the blockage. Common causes of mechanical obstruction include adhesions, hernias, tumors, strictures, and volvulus. **Physiological Consequences** - Impaired venous flow and bowel wall edema - As the proximal bowel distends, venous outflow from the bowel wall is compromised, resulting in bowel wall edema and inflammation. These changes can exacerbate luminal narrowing and impair the oxygenation of the bowel tissue. - Third spacing and fluid loss - Increased bowel wall permeability leads to fluid and electrolyte sequestration into the bowel lumen and third spacing into the peritoneal cavity as ascitic fluid. This fluid loss, coupled with vomiting and decreased oral intake, contributes
