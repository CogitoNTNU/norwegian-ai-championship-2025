was known as "pyknolepsy." This originates from the Greek term _pyknos_ , meaning "very frequent" or "grouped."[3][4] The term "petit mal" seizure was previously used to describe an absence seizure, but the term is no longer encouraged. The International League Against Epilepsy Classification of 2017 defines absence seizures as "generalized nonmotor seizures."[5] However, this term is not entirely precise because, as discussed below, motor manifestations of absence epilepsy are frequently seen.[2] Absence seizures have often been considered "benign" due to their nonconvulsive nature; however, up to 60% of children with absence seizures have severe neuropsychic manifestations, including disturbances in attention, cognition, memory, and mood.[6] Absence epilepsy affects a child's psychosocial and academic function and requires treatment. ## Etiology A genetic component exists for all generalized epilepsies and, specifically, for absence epilepsy. The inheritance pattern is not strictly autosomal recessive or dominant and is considered to be multifactorial and polygenic. In 1951, Lennox reported that 66% of monozygotic twins showed concordance for the EEG pattern of 3-Hertz spike and wave discharges. These can be voltage-gated (_CACNA1H, CACNG3, CLCN2)_ or ligand-gated (_CHRNA4_ , _GABRA1, GABRB3, GABRG2, GRM4_).[7] CAE is linked to many genetic variations, including at the following locations: [7] - Calcium-channel genes: _CACNA1H_ and _CACNG3_ (especially in Han Chinese) [8] - GABA-A and GABA-B receptors: GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter highly involved in epileptogenesis. _GABRA1, GABRB3,_ and _GABRG2_ are variants relating to CAE.[3][4][9] - Glutamate receptor: Mutations in _GRM4_ alter glutamate and GABA regulation. - Âµ-Opioid Receptor: _OPRM1_ is an opioid receptor where mutations can cause thalamic hyperexcitability. - Solute transfer receptor: _SLC6A3/DAT1_ are 2 genes in this category encoding a dopamine transporter. Also, some copy number variants (CNVs), for example, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, and 16p13.11 microdeletion, have been described in patients with CAE.[10] However, the mode of inheritance and the majority of genes implicated in CAE are still unknown.[4] ## Epidemiology The incidence of CAE is approximately 6.3 to 8.0 children per 100,000 individuals per year.[10][11][12] CAE is a common pediatric epilepsy syndrome. Among all cases of epilepsy in school-aged children, 10% to 17% are due to CAE.[1] The age of onset for CAE is typically between 4 and 10 years, with a peak between ages 5 and 7. Girls have CAE more frequently than boys; however, some of this evidence is conflicting.[4] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiological mechanism of the development of absence seizures is not yet fully understood. However, the
