stable conditions per specifications, the mean value is the targeted or expected value for the QC result. Concurrently, the standard deviation (SD) lines illustrate the expected level of imprecision. Under the assumption of a Gaussian (normal) distribution of imprecision, the results should demonstrate an even distribution around the mean, with occurrences more frequently observed closer to the mean than at the distribution's extremes.[81] Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of any rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be enforced before patient testing. Laboratories are required to participate in external quality control or proficiency testing (PT) programs as mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.[82] Participating in the PT program is beneficial as this guarantees the precision and reliability of the laboratory's results compared to other labs conducting similar assays. CMS and voluntary accreditation organizations oversee mandatory participation and results evaluation. The PT plan should be included in the quality assessment (QA) plan and the laboratory's overall quality program.[83] Every clinical laboratory should establish and uphold a formal safety program as its top priority. This program forms the foundation for ensuring patients' and laboratory staff's safety and well-being. The program provides a structured framework for recognizing, lessening, and controlling potential hazards linked with laboratory activities. The laboratory significantly diminishes the chances of errors, incidents, and exposure to unsafe materials through strict adherence to safety protocols.[84] Protective barriers, such as gloves, masks, protective eyewear, and gowns, must be employed when collecting patient specimens. Disposable gloves from nonsterile latex or alternative materials offering adequate barrier protection should be utilized. Phlebotomists must change gloves when moving between blood draws from different patients. Additionally, hand hygiene protocols are important when gloves are changed.[85] Lab technicians should wear facial protection and protective clothing to minimize the risk of exposure to blood or bodily fluids. They should also minimize syringe use and dispose of needles safely in rigid containers. After leaving the lab, they should remove all protective gear.[86] According to OSHA regulations, employees at risk of exposure should be offered the hepatitis B vaccine as part of their regular or occasional duties. Per the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, medical technologists, phlebotomists, and pathologists are recommended to receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Consequently, the obligation is to provide, at the very least, these laboratory employees with
