of natriuretic peptides increase after acute myocardial infarction; the extent of the increase is related to the size of the infarct.[50] Patients with smaller infarcts tend to have a monophasic increase in plasma BNP, peaking at 20 hours after the onset of symptoms; on the other hand, those with larger infarcts, lower ejection fraction, and clinical signs of heart failure may present a further peak at five days after admission.[51] A value of less than 100 pg/mL for BNP and less than 300 pg/mL for NT-proBNP makes the diagnosis of heart failure less likely in an acutely dyspneic patient.[52] Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides are associated with poor long-term prognosis and have an adverse impact on long-term mortality in patients with heart failure and various other conditions such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.[53] ## Clinical Significance **Heart Failure** The strongest indication for BNP measurement is distinguishing between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic causes of dyspnea in an emergent setting. Dyspnea is a symptom in nearly all cases of HF exacerbation. However, it is not specific to HF and may result from other pathologic processes.[54] The sensitivity of BNP in HF is approximately 97%. Therefore a normal BNP level (less than 100 pg/mL) virtually excludes heart failure and should prompt a search for noncardiac causes of dyspnea. An elevated level may indicate the presence of cardiac disease and the need for further cardiac workup, such as echocardiography, to determine the etiology of the patient's symptoms.[32] Furthermore, short-term elevations in hospitalized patients with HF have correlated with longer hospital stays. BNP can also be a useful prognostic marker in patients with known chronic heart failure; elevated levels are found in patients with higher New York Heart Association functional class scores and correlate with mortality, morbidity, and recurrent hospital admission.[20][55] Furthermore, in hospitalized patients with heart failure, short-term elevations in BNP have been shown to predict increased hospital stays.[56] **Acute Coronary Syndrome** Left ventricular dysfunction due to cardiac remodeling is a significant cause of mortality following myocardial infarction (MI). BNP monitoring can help assess prognosis following MI because it becomes elevated in patients with post-MI left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fractions less than 40%.[57] **Limitations** While BNP is a useful tool in assessing prognosis in patients with cardiac disease, it has not been well established that BNP-guided therapy offers improved outcomes compared to symptom-guided therapies.[54] Therefore, knowledge of BNP levels may predict outcomes
