be seen in patients with FES. \*\*_Arterial blood gas_ \*\* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch is a hallmark of FES. The arterial blood gas analysis usually has a low partial pressure of oxygen, causing hypoxemia. An increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient is common in FES. The A-a gradient is the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolus and the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. In FES, the pulmonary blood vessels are occluded, causing perfusion impairment with normal ventilation. The result of this in FES is a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. To calculate the A-a gradient, use the formula: **A-a gradient = PA02 - Pa02** - Pa02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery - PA02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar sac To calculate the PAO2 and Pa02 - PAO2 = FiO2 (P atmospheric - P water vapor) – (PCO2/R). - PaO2 = partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. PaO2 in arterial blood gas can be used as follows. - FiO2 is the concentration of inspired oxygen expressed as a fraction. This is around 0.21 at room air. - P atmospheric is the barometric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level). - P water vapor is the water vapor pressure (48 mmHg at 37 C). - PaCO2 is the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide. If approximated, this is presumed to be equal to arterial PCO2. PACO2 is presumed to be equal to 40 mmHg - R is the respiratory quotient, equating to about 0.8 on a regular diet. The normal alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is as follows: - PA02 = alveolar partial pressure of O2 = FiO2 × (patmospheric - P water vapor) - (PCO2/R). - 0.21 × (760 - 48) - (40/0.8) = 150-50 = 100 mmHg The normal partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood is between 75 to 100mmHg. - PA02 - Pa02 = 100 mmHg - 75 mm = 25 mmHg - PA02-Pa02 =100 mmHg -100 mmHg = 0 mmHg This implies that the A-a gradient can have values that range from 0 to 25 mmHg The normal A-a gradient is usually less than 10 mmHg. However, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch can significantly increase FES. **Bronchoalveolar Lavage** Bronchoalveolar lavage has been extensively researched as a diagnostic tool for FES. Lipid inclusion in the macrophages might point to a diagnosis of FES but is not specific, as this can
