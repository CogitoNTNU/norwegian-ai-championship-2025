trastuzumab), snake venom, transplant vasculopathy, and critical illness.[98] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours.[99] Laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.[100] To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturers’ recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency (such as once per month), the labs can develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP) that involves performing a risk assessment of potential sources of error in all phases of testing and putting in place a QC plan to reduce the likelihood of errors.[101] Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of any rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing.[102] The laboratory must participate in the external quality control or proficiency testing (PT) program because it is a regulatory requirement published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.[103] It is helpful to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the laboratory with regard to other laboratories performing the same or comparable assays. Required participation and scored results are monitored by CMS and voluntary accreditation organizations.[104] The PT plan should be included as an aspect of the quality assessment (QA) plan and the overall quality program of the laboratory.[105] Quality assurance procedures should be implemented within the laboratory for the reliable and reproducible performance of troponin assays, particularly at low concentrations, to avoid reporting falsely positive results. In addition to regularly monitoring manufacturers’ quality controls, daily measurement of a negative control sample and a low-level control with a troponin concentration close to the 20% CV level (in-house or manufactured if available) can detect assay drift or deterioration of assay performance.[106] Compared with a short-term evaluation, long-term monitoring of troponin imprecision will consider new troponin reagent lots, changes in reagent formulation, and any suboptimal analyzer performance.[107] Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the usual precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.[108] Wear gloves, a lab coat, and safety glasses when handling human blood specimens. Place all plastic tips, sample
