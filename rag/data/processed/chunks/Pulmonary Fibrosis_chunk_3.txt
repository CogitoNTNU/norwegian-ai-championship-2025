this dysregulated repair process leads to increased matrix deposition in the lung interstitium and scarring, ultimately destroying lung architecture and the development of pulmonary fibrosis.[12] The destruction of lung architecture impairs gas exchange and progresses to hypoxic respiratory failureâ€”a hallmark of advanced disease. About 70% to 80% of patients with IPF have a history of smoking, explaining why around 30% also present with concurrent emphysema. This subgroup of patients with both IPF and emphysema exhibits a distinct PFT profile. Specifically, they typically demonstrate relatively preserved total lung capacity and forced vital capacity (FVC), yet significantly decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This profile is likely attributed to the combined effects of parenchymal fibrosis and destruction associated with both conditions.[18] As pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea are prevalent among patients with IPF,[19] screening for these comorbidities is essential in patients. Even mild pulmonary hypertension is a poor prognostic indicator.[9][18][20] IPF is also highly linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). In a study evaluating lung transplant candidates for CAD as part of the transplant work-up, 29% of those with IPF were found to have significant CAD, compared to only 10% of those with emphysema, despite a higher proportion of heavy smokers in the emphysema group.[9][21] The prevalence of CAD in patients with IPF is estimated at 4% to 25%, and patients with IPF have a 3-fold increased risk of acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without IPF.[18] Patients with IPF have a significantly higher risk of venous thromboembolism compared to those without the condition. Longitudinal analysis indicates that the risk of venous thromboembolism in IPF patients is 3- to 6-fold higher than in individuals without IPF.[18][22] Notably, malignancy, particularly lung cancer, is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism, and patients with IPF face a 5-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer.[9][18] Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common comorbidity in patients with IPF. Although many individuals may have clinically silent GERD, estimates suggest that 30% to 50% of those with IPF also experience this condition. In addition, it is hypothesized that GERD contributes to the pathology of IPF through chronic microaspiration. Trials have been conducted to explore the use of GERD therapy in slowing the progression of IPF, but the results are inconclusive.[18][23][24] Additionally, hiatal hernia is common in IPF patients, and surgical intervention for this condition has shown success in individuals awaiting lung transplants.[23][25] Osteoporosis
