between the 2 conditions, as dynamic air bronchograms, in which the hyperechoic artifacts are mobile, moving greater than 1 mm with respiratory efforts, are more likely in pneumonia than in atelectasis. Additional history and findings such as fever and leukocytosis may strengthen the practitioner's suspicion of pneumonia, as well. Empyema may also be seen with bedside ultrasound, appearing as a hyperechoic fluid collection within the lung parenchyma, often septated or loculated appearance. Early findings may appear hypoechoic without septa. [6][7][8][9] ## Complications Few complications exist with basic thoracic ultrasound short of pain with an applied probe to areas of tenderness, as in rib fractures. Although ultrasound can be performed rapidly at the bedside by qualified personnel, operative management should not be delayed in critical cases where ultrasonographic evaluation will add little to the care of the patient. In the case of bedside ultrasound, use in procedures such as thoracentesis, it is critical that all landmarks (diaphragm, liver, spleen, lung, and chest wall) are identified prior to intervention as to avoid iatrogenic injury. Real-time direct visualization of needle or catheter is recommended. ## Clinical Significance The diagnostic and procedural use of thoracic ultrasound has rapidly grown within the last 10 years due to being largely accepted by emergency physicians' adaptation of POCUS into formal residency training, as well as improvements in the bedside ultrasounds themselves. It allows rapid diagnosis and visualization of pathology and improves accuracy in diagnosis and procedures without the risk of exposure to potentially harmful radiation. [5] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Thoracic ultrasound is sometimes performed by the emergency department physician, internist, intensivist or nurse practitioner to look for pleural fluid or aspiration of a fluid collection from the chest cavity. It is important that that only professionals trained in ultrasound use this technique. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, a radiologist should be consulted first before inserting any tube or needle in the chest cavity. Once the fluid is removed, a chest x-ray is recommended to ensure that there is no pneumothorax. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19391&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19391) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/thoracic-and-lung-ultrasound-ultrasound/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19391) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19391/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19391) [![Thoracic Ultrasound Contributed by Alan Taylor, M](/books/NBK500013/bin/IMG_20180418_171839.gif)](/books/NBK500013/figure/article-19391.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK500013/figure/article-19391.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Thoracic Ultrasound Contributed by Alan Taylor, M.D. ## References 1.
