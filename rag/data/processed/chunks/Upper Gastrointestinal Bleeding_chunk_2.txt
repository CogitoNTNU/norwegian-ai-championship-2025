- Complete blood count - Hemoglobin/hematocrit - International normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time - Lactate - Liver function tests **Diagnostic Studies** - Upper GI endoscopy - Can be diagnostic and therapeutic - Allows visualization of the upper GI tract (typically including from the oral cavity up to the duodenum) and treatment with injection therapy, thermal coagulation, or hemostatic clips/bands - Lower GI endoscopy/colonoscopy - Can be diagnostic and therapeutic - Allows visualization of the lower GI tract (including the colon and terminal ileum) and treatment with injection therapy, thermal coagulation, or hemostatic clips/bands - Push enteroscopy - Allows further visualization of the small bowel - Deep small bowel enteroscopy - Allows further visualization of the small bowel - Nuclear scintigraphy - Tagged RBC scan - Detects bleeding occurring at a rate of 0.1 to 0.5 mL/min using technetium-99m (can only detect active bleeding[8] - Can be helpful to localize angiographic and surgical interventions - CT angiography - Allows for identification of an actively bleeding vessel - Standard angiography - Allows for identification of a bleeding vessel and potential treatment via embolization or intra-arterial vasopressin[9] - Requires the active bleeding be at a rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min to visualize the site[10] - Meckel scan - Nuclear medicine scan to look for ectopic gastric mucosa ## Treatment / Management Acute management of GI bleeding typically involves an assessment of the appropriate setting for treatment followed by resuscitation and supportive therapy while investigating the underlying cause and attempting to correct it. **Risk Stratification** Specific risk calculators attempt to help identify patients who would benefit from ICU level of care; most stratify based on mortality risk. The AIMS65 score and the Rockall score calculate the mortality rate of upper GI bleeds. There are two separate Rockall scores; One is calculated before endoscopy and identifies pre-endoscopy mortality, whereas the second score is calculated post-endoscopy and calculates overall mortality and re-bleeding risks. The Oakland score is a risk calculator that attempts to help calculate the probability of a safe discharge in lower GI bleeds.[11] **Setting** - ICU - Patients with hemodynamic instability, continuous bleeding, or those with a significant risk of morbidity/mortality should undergo monitoring in an intensive care unit to facilitate more frequent observation of vital signs and more emergent therapeutic intervention. - General Medical Ward - Most other patients can undergo monitoring on a general medical floor. However,
