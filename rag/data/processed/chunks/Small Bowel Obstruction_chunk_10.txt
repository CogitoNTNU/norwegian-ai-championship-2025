diagnosis of the cause and in planning surgical intervention. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - MRI is occasionally used, particularly in special circumstances such as with patients who are pregnant or when CT is contraindicated. This study provides detailed soft tissue imaging and can be useful for detecting complications like ischemia or tumors. ## Treatment / Management The treatment and management of SBO require a multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes early recognition and intervention to optimize patient outcomes. **Initial Resuscitation** The initial management of SBO begins with fluid resuscitation to address hypovolemia caused by third-spacing of fluids, vomiting, and reduced oral intake. Isotonic intravenous fluids, such as lactated Ringer or normal saline, are administered to restore intravascular volume and correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nasogastric tube decompression is employed to alleviate gastric distension and vomiting, reduce the risk of aspiration, and provide symptomatic relief. In prolonged cases or when surgery is delayed, nutritional support via enteral or parenteral routes may be necessary to prevent malnutrition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gut flora, including gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, should be administered, particularly when strangulation or perforation is suspected.[28][29][30] Surgical consultation should be obtained promptly, as many cases of SBO, especially those involving complete obstruction or signs of ischemia, require operative management.[31] **Nonoperative Management** Nonoperative or conservative management is suitable for simple SBO without signs of ischemia, peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. This approach involves bowel rest with the patient kept nil per os to minimize bowel distension. Serial monitoring of vital signs, abdominal exams, and laboratory tests is essential to detect any worsening condition. Water-soluble contrast studies using agents like gastrograffin can help resolve adhesional obstructions and offer prognostic value by indicating whether the obstruction may resolve without surgery. **Indications for Surgery** Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with evidence of strangulation, such as fever, tachycardia, localized tenderness, leukocytosis, or acidosis. Surgical intervention is imperative when SBO fails to resolve with conservative measures or when there are signs of peritonitis or bowel ischemia, ensuring timely and effective treatment.[32] **Surgical Management** Surgical options depend on the underlying cause of SBO. Adhesiolysis is the most common procedure, performed laparoscopically or via open surgery, to release fibrous bands causing the obstruction. For strangulated obstruction, resection of the necrotic bowel may be required, followed by either primary anastomosis or stoma formation, depending on the extent of damage and patient stability.
