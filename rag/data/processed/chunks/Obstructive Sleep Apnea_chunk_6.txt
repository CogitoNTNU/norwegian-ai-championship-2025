Changes and Treating Underlying Medical Conditions** The importance of weight loss should be emphasized in patients with OSA who are overweight or have obesity.[53][54] Although weight loss is recommended and can often decrease the severity of OSA, it is usually not curative. Patients should be educated about the impact of sleep duration on their health and encouraged to prioritize getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.[55] Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and certain antidepressants, as these may exacerbate their condition. Concomitant nasal obstruction should be addressed with nasal steroids for allergic rhinitis or surgically for nasal valve collapse. For patients with lung or heart conditions, such as asthma or heart failure, optimizing the treatment of these disorders is crucial. **Positional Therapy** OSA that is more pronounced in the supine position can be treated with a positioning device to maintain side-sleeping, which can be an effective option.[56][57] **Positive Airway Pressure Therapy** Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for adults with OSA.[58] Bilevel PAP is also better tolerated by patients who require higher pressure settings (>15 cm H2O). However, despite the high efficacy of CPAP in eliminating respiratory events, its effectiveness is limited by decreased usage during sleep and poor adherence. Adherence to CPAP remains a significant challenge, as nearly half of patients do not consistently follow treatment after the first month.[59] The American Thoracic Society recently published a statement on CPAP adherence tracking systems, optimal monitoring strategies, and outcome measures in adults.[60] Standardizing CPAP adherence reports is crucial, not only by tracking the number of hours used (>4 hours per night on >70% of nights) but also by including the amount of mask leak and the residual apnea and hypopnea index. However, what constitutes the optimal adherence goal for OSA treatment remains uncertain. Recent studies have explored the utility of telemedicine adherence interventions, remote CPAP monitoring, and more interactive features with patients and their families, which have been shown to increase CPAP adherence rates.[61][62][63][64] Several studies have reported conflicting findings when assessing the effect of CPAP therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA.[44] In a recent randomized controlled trial, CPAP use for a minimum of 1 year in patients with acute coronary syndrome and OSA, without excessive daytime sleepiness, did not lower the incidence of cardiovascular events. These events were defined as cardiac-related deaths or one or more
