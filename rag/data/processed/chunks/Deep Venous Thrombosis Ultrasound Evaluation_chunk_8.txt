Differential Diagnosis The following are differential diagnoses of deep venous thrombosis: - Cellulitis - Post-thrombotic syndrome (especially venous eczema and lipodermatosclerosis) - Ruptured Baker cyst - Trauma - Superficial thrombophlebitis - Peripheral edema, heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome - Venous or lymphatic obstruction - Arteriovenous fistula and congenital vascular abnormalities - Vasculitis [35] ## Surgical Oncology Given the increased risk of thromboembolism, patients with clinically active malignancy would benefit from thromboprophylaxis. A meta-analysis looking at a total of 33 trials and 11,972 patients provided more evidence that thromboprophylaxis decreased the incidence of VTE in cancer patients who were undergoing chemotherapy or surgery, with no apparent increase in the incidence of significant bleeding.[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin in hospitalized cancer patients as thromboprophylaxis. Mechanical prophylaxis should be used instead of anticoagulation therapy in patients experiencing active bleeding, thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 50,000/MCL), evidence of hemorrhagic coagulopathy, or having an indwelling neuraxial catheter. Contraindications to mechanical prophylaxis include acute deep venous thrombosis and severe arterial insufficiency. A recent meta-analysis addressed the question of the optimum duration of anticoagulation in cancer patients hospitalized with acute illnesses. This study looked at trials comparing standard-duration versus extended-duration anticoagulation prophylaxis. The risk of VTE was not significantly lower in the extended-duration prophylaxis group of patients, but the risk of bleeding was about 2-fold higher.[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Regarding outpatient VTE prophylaxis, surgical pelvic or abdominal oncology patients would benefit from continuing VTE prophylaxis up to four weeks post-operation. The use of aspirin or anticoagulation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma on immunomodulatory medications is recommended based on risk stratification with the IMPEDE VTE score.[[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/)[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) For patients with solid cancers on chemotherapy and high Khorana score, prophylactic anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulation or low molecular weight heparin showed a decrease in the incidence of pulmonary embolism.[[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remains the preferred anticoagulation option for managing cancer-associated thrombosis.[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) The dosage recommendation for LMWH is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and 1 mg/kg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/minute. Avoid the use of LMWH in patients on dialysis. Other treatment options include direct oral anticoagulants like apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, fondaparinux, and warfarin. In the Caravaggio trial, researchers found apixaban to be non-inferior to LMWH in treating cancer-associated VTE without an increased risk of significant bleeding.[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Thrombolytic therapy can
