Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of mortality worldwide, with 17.6 million deaths annually.[1] Cardiac stress testing is an important diagnostic tool for known or suspected coronary artery disease.[2] Eight million nuclear stress tests are performed annually in the United States. While stress testing can be performed in a variety of ways, more commonly performed and widely available are exercise electrocardiography (EKG) and exercise or pharmacological stress testing along with imaging such as echocardiography or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI). It can help establish the diagnosis, risk stratify, and guide therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. An intravenous radioactive tracer is administered, and gamma photons are captured using single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). Myocardial perfusion images are obtained during rest and after stress with either exercise or pharmacological agents, preferably vasodilators. Both the images are then compared to detect myocardial perfusion, viability, and global left ventricular systolic function, which generally signifies the presence and extent of coronary artery disease. ## Procedures Radionuclide MPI provides essential information on myocardial perfusion at rest and exercise or pharmacological testing with the help of a radioactive tracer. Commonly used tracers for SPECT MPI are technetium-99m based (Tc99m and Tc99m tetrofosmin) or thallium-201.[3] Dual isotope in combination with thallium-201 and technetium-99m are sometimes used, while PET MPI uses rubidium-82 or N13-ammonia. Half-lives of PET tracers are short; hence pharmacological stress testing with vasodilators is preferred than exercise stress testing.[4] When the radioactive tracer is administered intravenously, it allows visual assessment of coronary blood flow and perfusion to the cardiac muscles. ## Indications In recent years, the number of modalities for the evaluation of CAD has rapidly expanded. Non-invasive testing now includes perfusion echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The clinician must determine the pre-test probability for CAD prior to selecting the diagnostic test. Patients with intermediate probability for CAD are most likely to benefit from additional cardiovascular testing.[5] Nuclear stress testing plays an important role in determining the management of these patients,
