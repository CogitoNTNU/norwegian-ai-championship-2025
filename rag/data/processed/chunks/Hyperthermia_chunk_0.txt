Several conditions can cause hyperthermia. In sepsis, the immunologic reaction to the infection most often manifests as a fever. Some toxic ingestions and withdrawal states can cause elevated body temperature. Certain medication reactions can also cause hyperthermia, such as in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The most common disease that can be treated by cooling alone is heat-related illness and heat stroke. Heat-related illness is a spectrum of diseases that occurs when the body's thermoregulatory system fails. This activity reviews the evaluation of patients with hyperthermia and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Outline the indications for cooling in hyperthermic patients. - Describe the technique of cooling hyperthermic patients. - Summarize the potential complications of cooling for hyperthermia. - Explain interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hyperthermia and improve patient outcomes.

Several conditions can cause hyperthermia. In sepsis, the immunologic reaction to the infection most often manifests as a fever. Some toxic ingestions and withdrawal states can cause elevated body temperature. Certain medication reactions can also cause hyperthermia, such as in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The most common diseases that can be treated by cooling alone are heat-related illnesses and heat stroke. Heat-related illness is a spectrum of diseases that occurs when the body's thermoregulatory system fails. Heat exhaustion is characterized by elevated core body temperature associated with orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and tachypnea. Heatstroke is defined as elevated core body temperature plus central nervous system involvement (delirium, decreased level of consciousness, or ataxia). The heat-related illness most often affects athletes (exertional hyperthermia) but can also occur during the warm weather months or in locations with extreme temperatures. Patients with impaired thermoregulation, such as those at extremes of age, the obese, or the mentally ill, are at higher risk. The definitive treatment for heat-related illness is total body cooling.
