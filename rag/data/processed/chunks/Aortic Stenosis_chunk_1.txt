shown to contribute to the calcification of the valve.[11] Obstruction to the left ventricular (LV) outflow can occur above or below the valve, causing supravalvular stenosis and subvalvular stenosis, respectively. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause dynamic subvalvular stenosis. ## Epidemiology The prevalence of calcific aortic sclerosis is about 1% to 2% in patients aged 65 or less and 29% in patients aged 65 or more. About 2 to 9% of patients aged greater than 75 have severe aortic stenosis.[12][13] The prevalence of aortic sclerosis ranges from 9 to 45% in patients with a mean age of 54 to 81 and increases with age.[14] The relative prevalence of aortic stenosis in patients with tri-leaflet versus congenitally abnormal valves varies with age.[15] The causes of aortic stenosis vary geographically as calcific stenosis is more common in North America and Europe, while rheumatic valve disease is more common in developing countries. The number is expected to increase twofold or threefold in the coming decades with the aging of the population.[16] ## Pathophysiology Left ventricular (LV) obstruction caused by the stenosis of the valve increases LV systolic pressure. It also results in increased LV ejection time (LVET), decreased aortic pressure, and increased LV end-diastolic pressure. The increased afterload, in addition, to an increase in LV volume overload, leads to an increase in LV mass, ultimately leading to LV dysfunction and failure. Myocardial oxygen consumption increases with increased LV systolic pressure, LV mass, and LVET, while myocardial perfusion time decreases with increased LVET. Hence, LV function further deteriorates with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased myocardial oxygen supply.[8] ## History and Physical The acquired aortic stenosis manifests with exertional dyspnea, syncope, angina, and, ultimately, heart failure.[17][18] Typically, symptoms begin at the age of 50 to 70 years in patients with the bicuspid aortic valve and in greater than 70 years in patients with tri-leaflet valve calcific stenosis. Patients progressively experience a gradual decrease in exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. Severe exertional dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and pulmonary edema show various degrees of pulmonary venous hypertension. Angina results from the combination of the need for increased oxygen in hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of oxygen delivery secondary to the excessive compression of coronary vessels. Syncope is caused by the decrease in cerebral perfusion occurring during exertion when the arterial pressure declines due to systemic vasodilation and an inadequate increase in cardiac output related to stenosis.
