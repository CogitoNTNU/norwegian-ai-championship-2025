Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study include male sex, cigarette smoking, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and valvular disease.[13] Social determinants of health, such as education, occupation, and income, also contribute to the development of heart failure.[14][15] **Predisposing Conditions for Primary Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** The risk factors, underlying etiologies, and pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF differ significantly; HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.[16] Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for all heart failure subtypes; aging significantly influences the development of HFpEF more than HFrEF.[17][18] However, individuals younger than 65 can develop HFpEF; this may represent a unique age-based phenotype.[9] This same increased influence is seen for atrial fibrillation, female sex, and pulmonary hypertension of any etiology.[18] Obesity and diabetes are also significant risk factors and predictors of HFpEF.[18] Patients with HFpEF and obesity tend to be younger than patients with HFpEF and an average body mass index.[19] While arterial hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of HFpEF across all populations, obesity is a disproportionately substantial risk factor for patients who identify as African American or Hispanic.[20] HFpEF is rarely due to a single identifiable clinical condition but arises in patients with various risk factors; the predominant risk factor may or may not indicate a specific phenotype of HFpEFâ€”thus, the heterogeneity of the disease.[16] Risk factors for the development of HFpEF appear to include but are not limited to: - Increasing age - Female sex - Type 2 diabetes - Obesity - Sleep apnea - Hypertension - Pulmonary hypertension - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Iron deficiency, with or without anemia - Coronary artery disease - Atrial fibrillation - Dysrhythmias [16] The exact pathogenic role of each risk factor is poorly understood. **Etiologies of Secondary Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** Secondary HFpEF occurs in a clinical condition that directly causes the heart to fail. These conditions are sometimes referred to as "HFpEF mimics."[16] These mimics include but are not limited to restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies of any etiology, constrictive pericarditis, and valvular heart disease.[16][7] In the United States, left-sided valvular disease is the most commonly encountered HFpEF mimic, and aortic stenosis should be suspected in all patients with signs, symptoms, or suspicion of HFpEF.[21][16] **Etiologies of Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** Patients with HFpEF are at increased risk for deterioration of cardiac function in the setting of various commonly encountered
