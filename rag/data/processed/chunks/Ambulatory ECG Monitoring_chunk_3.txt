using a button on the device, facilitating better correlation between symptoms and conduction events. Patch monitors are typically worn for 14 days, significantly extending the monitoring duration compared to the conventional 48-hour monitors. Prolonged monitoring increases the likelihood of identifying arrhythmias that might go unnoticed in shorter monitoring periods. A study conducted by Barret et al demonstrated that the adhesive patch monitor outperformed the Holter monitor in detecting cardiac events in patients with suspected arrhythmia.[16][17] **Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry™** In contrast to the offline analysis permitted by typical patch monitors, Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry**™** (MOCT**™**) devices provide real-time, wireless arrhythmia monitoring, transmission, and analysis. Patients can trigger the machine to collect and automatically transmit data during symptomatic episodes.[18] MOCT**™** has demonstrated superior diagnosis of clinically significant arrhythmias compared to standard patient-triggered loop monitors.[19][20] Medic et al studied a cohort of 1000 patients with cryptogenic stroke and no history of atrial fibrillation to compare the expense and diagnostic accuracy of 30 days of MCOT**™** followed by an implantable loop recorder (ILR) versus an ILR alone. The results demonstrated that an initial 30-day monitoring period with MCOT**™** increased detection rates of atrial fibrillation at a cost 8 times lower than an ILR alone.[21] **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators and Permanent Pacemakers** Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and permanent pacemakers (PPMs) can be continuous monitoring devices with detection algorithms for arrhythmias, including supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. (See **Image.** Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Recording) When appropriately programmed, these devices exhibit sensitivity and specificity of greater than 95% in detecting atrial fibrillation.[22] In specific scenarios, patients with ICDs or PPMs may undergo external ECG monitoring to assess the functionality of implanted devices and identify potential malfunctions. Device interrogation allows data retrieval regarding the frequency and duration of arrhythmias, ventricular rates, and the necessity for shock termination episodes. Additionally, remote monitoring of these devices is available to evaluate arrhythmias and the efficacy of delivered therapies.[23] **Consumer Devices** Rapidly advancing technology has led to the widespread availability of heart rate and rhythm monitors, employing smartphones as convenient storage devices for the captured data. Some of these monitors feature algorithms that can detect irregularities, particularly atrial fibrillation, offering the potential for early detection, treatment, and reduction of stroke risk. Some rhythm monitors in smartphones and handheld devices record single-lead ECG data, including rhythm strips, during symptomatic episodes; this data can be shared with physicians for review to streamline the process of atrial fibrillation detection.
