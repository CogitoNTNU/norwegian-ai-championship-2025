seeking medical care is essential. Therefore, patients should be counseled on the most common symptoms associated with ACS and the importance of seeking urgent medical evaluation.[2][26][4] In this way, patient delays may be avoided, thus reducing total ischemic time.[2][4] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The de Winter electrocardiogram pattern highly suggests acute occlusion of the LAD artery.[8][9][10] Given this background, all members involved in the interprofessional care process of individuals presenting with acute chest pain should be able to identify this ECG finding expertly, thus streamlining the diagnostic and therapeutic process of this challenging and high-risk subset of patients. Healthcare practitioners in the many departments that may encounter these patients, including primary care, emergency room, cardiology, and internal medicine, should recognize that further evaluation is warranted when the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is present, leading to improved recognition of potential abnormalities. Additionally, electrocardiogram technicians, cardiac procedural staff, and pharmaceutical clinicians are often needed to provide care to these patients when diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes. As a result, clinicians can use this finding to help guide treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.[2][5][10][26][4] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=98283&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=98283) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/the-de-winter-ecg-pattern/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=98283) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/98283/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=98283) [![The de Winter ECG Pattern](/books/NBK557573/bin/Figure1.gif)](/books/NBK557573/figure/article-98283.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK557573/figure/article-98283.image.f1/?report=objectonly) The de Winter ECG Pattern.
