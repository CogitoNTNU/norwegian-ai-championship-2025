are generally below 250 mg/d or 150 mg/L of urine. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Hypercalciuria](/pubmed/28846247)," for more information. **Citrate** Citrate is a potent urinary inhibitor of calcium salt crystallization and acts as a urinary alkalinizing agent. Hypocitraturia, a common risk factor for kidney stones, occurs in up to one-third of calcium stone formers. Low urinary citrate levels may result from dietary factors, metabolic acidosis, or hypokalemia, though it can also be idiopathic. Citrate is present in citrus juices such as grapefruit, orange, lemon, and lime. However, most patients with low urinary citrate levels typically require supplementation, often in potassium citrate, as dietary intake alone is usually insufficient to correct the deficiency. Concentrated citrate supplements, such as potassium citrate, are available in tablet and liquid forms. Lower potassium alternatives are also offered, and sodium bicarbonate may be used. Optimal urinary citrate levels are approximately 300 mg/1000 mL of urine or around 600 mg daily. Higher doses may be necessary if the therapy aims to increase urinary pH, especially in cases of pure uric acid urolithiasis, where optimizing urinary pH is crucial. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/66949)," for more information. Overalkalinization of the urine can predispose patients to calcium phosphate stone production, particularly if the pH consistently exceeds 7.0. Low urinary citrate levels may also contribute to persistent calcium-based stones in some patients, even when hydrochlorothiazide is used. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Hypocitraturia and Renal Calculi](/pubmed/33232062)," for more information. **Magnesium** Magnesium plays a role in inhibiting urinary crystallization, reducing the risk of stone formation. Approximately half of dietary magnesium is excreted in the urine, so low urinary magnesium levels are often due to inadequate dietary intake. A urinary magnesium level below 24 mg/d is generally considered abnormally low. **Metanephrines and Catecholamines** Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can produce elevated levels of metanephrines and catecholamines, leading to hypertension. Rarely, neuroblastomas may also cause increased levels. Fractionated metanephrines are generally preferred for diagnosis, but catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid measurements can also be useful. Each reference laboratory will have its own specified normal ranges, but in general, normal 24-hour urine levels would include the following: - Dopamine: Up to 400 mcg - Epinephrine: Up to 20 mcg - Norepinephrine: Less than 100 mcg - Normetanephrine: Less than 350 mcg - Total catecholamines: Less than 100 mcg - Total metanephrines: Less than 400 mcg - Vanillylmandelic acid: Less than 7 mg Please see
