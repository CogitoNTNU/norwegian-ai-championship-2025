step and will usually give the diagnosis. However, at times, the patient may suffer from paroxysmal arrhythmia. The following modalities can be used for diagnosing based on the frequency of the symptoms a patient has secondary to a suspected arrhythmia. - Ambulatory EKG monitoring for patients with frequent symptoms - The event recorder needs to be triggered by the patient to record and will not a viable choice for patients with syncope. - Loop event recorder records up to 2 minutes before the trigger. It is good for patients with syncope. - Implantable loop recorder for patients with less frequent symptoms. **Tachyarrhythmia** Tachyarrhythmia is defined as an abnormal rhythm with a ventricular heart rate of 100 beats per minute or more. It\*\*\*\* can be further classified based on the origin of the arrhythmia into: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Arrhythmia originating from above the AV node (from atrial origin or AV junction origin). - Atrial fibrillation (AFib) - Atrial flutter - Atrial tachycardia - Atrial premature complex (PAC) - Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) - Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) - AV junctional extrasystoles Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The origin of the arrhythmia is below the AV node. - Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) - Ventricular premature beats (PVC) - Ventricular tachycardia (sustained or non-sustained) Tachyarrhythmias can also be classified based on the QRS complex duration into: Narrow QRS complex tachycardia when QRS is \<120 milliseconds in duration: - Sinus tachycardia - Atrial tachycardia (AT) - Atrial flutter - Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) - Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) - Junctional ectopic tachycardia - Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT) - Atrial fibrillation (irregular QRS complexes) Wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥120 milliseconds in duration) is classified as monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. **Supraventricular Tachycardia Syndromes** [2] [3] These are usually narrow complex tachycardias with QRS width being less than 3 mm or 120 milliseconds on the EKG strip. Supraventricular tachycardia is further classified into atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia based on the mechanism of tachycardia. \*\*\*\* I. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT): As found in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (the presence of delta wave without arrhythmia doesn’t require investigation or treatment). Mechanism: Accessory pathway present outside of the AV node-Bundle of Kent. It can be further categorized into: - Antidromic: Conduction down the accessory pathway and up to the AV node leading to the formation of a delta wave. -
