is most effectively achieved through an interprofessional team that includes a sleep specialist, primary care provider, cardiologist, otolaryngologist, dietitian, pulmonologist, neurologist, and nursing staff. Several treatment options are available for OSA, with the primary treatment being CPAP. Although clinicians oversee overall therapy, nurses and sleep evaluation personnel have a critical role. Nurses are often the first providers to detect therapeutic failure or noncompliance (eg, with CPAP machines) and should prompt clinicians to address the issue and ensure appropriate diagnostic algorithms are followed. An interprofessional care model will lead to the best possible outcomes for OSA patients, particularly given the challenges in managing the condition. Unfortunately, compliance with CPAP remains low. While some patients may benefit from an oral or nasal device, compliance remains challenging. Surgery is considered a last resort and should only be pursued after a thorough evaluation. Surgery does not cure the disorder, is expensive, and may lead to severe complications. The prognosis for most patients with OSA is guarded. Until weight loss is achieved, most therapies exhibit limited efficacy. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26084&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26084) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/obstructive-sleep-apnea-sleep-apnea/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26084) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26084/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26084) [![Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas](/books/NBK459252/bin/Polygraph__Apnea.gif)](/books/NBK459252/figure/article-26084.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459252/figure/article-26084.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas.
