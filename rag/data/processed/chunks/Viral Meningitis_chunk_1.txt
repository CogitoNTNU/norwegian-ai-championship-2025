- Malignancy - Dural defects - IV drug use - Sickle cell anemia - Splenectomy ## Epidemiology In the United States, the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis is approximately 1.38 cases/100,000 population with a case fatality rate of 14.3%. [6] The highest incidence of meningitis worldwide is in an area of sub-Saharan Africa dubbed “the meningitis belt” stretching from Ethiopia to Senegal.[7][2][8] Most common bacterial causes of meningitis in the United States are: [9] - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (incidence in 2010: 0.3/100,000) - group B _Streptococcus_ - _Neisseria meningitidis_ (incidence in 2010: 0.123/100,000) - _Haemophilus influenzae_(incidence in 2010: 0.058/100,000) - _Listeria monocytogenes_ Consider less common bacteria such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ in patients with recent surgery, central lines, and trauma. _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ should be considered in immunocompromised hosts. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ in patients with travel to Lyme endemic areas. _Treponema pallidum_ in HIV/AIDS and individuals with multiple sexual partners. _Escherichia coli_ is an important pathogen in the neonatal period. The most common viral agents of meningitis are non-polio enteroviruses (group b coxsackievirus and echovirus). Other viral causes: mumps, Parechovirus, Herpesviruses (including Epstein Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, and Varicella-zoster virus), measles, influenza, and arboviruses (West Nile, La Crosse, Powassan, Jamestown Canyon) Fungal meningitis typically is associated with an immunocompromised host (HIV/AIDS, chronic corticosteroid therapy, and patients with cancer). Fungi causing meningitis include: - _Cryptococcus neoformans_ - _Coccidioides immitis_ - _Aspergillus_ - _Candida_ - Mucormycosis (more common in patients with diabetes mellitus and transplant recipients; direct extension of sinus infection) ## Pathophysiology Meningitis typically occurs through two routes of inoculation: Hematogenous seeding - Bacteria colonize the nasopharynx and enter the bloodstream after mucosal invasion. Upon making their way to the subarachnoid space, the bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier, causing a direct inflammatory and immune-mediated reaction. Direct contiguous spread - Organisms can enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via neighboring anatomic structures (otitis media, sinusitis), foreign objects (medical devices, penetrating trauma), or during operative procedures. Viruses can penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) via retrograde transmission along neuronal pathways or by hematogenous seeding. ## History and Physical Meningitis can have a varied clinical presentation depending on age and immune status of the host. Symptoms typically include fever, neck pain/stiffness, and photophobia. More non-specific symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium, irritability, and nausea/vomiting. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and seizures) portend a poor prognosis. The following risk factors should increase clinical suspicion:
