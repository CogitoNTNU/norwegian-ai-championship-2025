and monitoring changes in the lungs over an 11-day period. The subsequent histopathological examination of the lung tissues included staining for the smooth muscle's fat, collagen, and actin. The most notable change was a decrease in the patency of the arteries and arterioles over the first 96 hours. Still, there was a return to normal patency towards the end of the observation period, the 11th day. There was also significant inflammation and fibrosis around the blood vessels. These changes were noticeable within the first couple of hours of infusion and persisted for the time frame for which the study was conducted. Although the results of a rat model give insight into the changes that can occur in patients with fat embolism or FES. ## History and Physical A fat embolism can travel to most of the body's organs. Fat embolism and FES are multiorgan diseases that can damage the kidneys, heart, skin, brain, and lungs. Fat embolism typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult. **History** The history should elicit the time and onset of symptoms. Also, since most cases of fat embolism and FES are related to orthopedic trauma, the time and mechanism of the trauma and intraoperative maneuvers should be noted in the history. Sickle cell disease and other forms of hemoglobinopathy can precipitate FES. Patients should be asked about the history of sickle cell disease in family members and any complications of sickle cell disease like acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises, or avascular necrosis of long bones. The history of drug ingestion or alcoholism that can trigger pancreatitis leading to FES should also be clarified. The symptoms of fat embolism and FES are nonspecific. Patients might complain of the following: - Pain related to bone fracture - Nausea - General weakness - Malaise - Difficulty breathing - Headache **Signs and Symptoms** These include but are not limited to the following: \*\*_Respiratory_ \*\* - Tachypnea - Tachycardia - Diaphoresis **_Central nervous system_** - Agitation from hypoxia - Restlessness - Change in mental status - Seizure - Coma \*\*_Skin_ \*\* Petechial rash \*\*_Eye_ \*\* Retinal hemorrhage **Physical Examination** The examination of a patient with FES should be very thorough. Particular attention should be paid to the patient's general appearance. \*\*_General Appearance_ \*\* Most patients with FES are anxious, agitated, and ill-looking. \*\*_Respiratory system_ \*\* \_\_ Assess for abnormal breath sounds, work of breathing, and evidence of respiratory
