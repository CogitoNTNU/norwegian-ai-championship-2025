to the deltoid when possible. Repeat studies have shown that providers often wait too long before giving epinephrine; it is the treatment of choice, and the rapid benefit much outweighs the risks of withholding treatment. While most patients require only a single dose, repeat doses may be given every 5 to 10 minutes as needed until symptoms improve. If patients require multiple doses, a continuous infusion of epinephrine may be considered; start an initial intravenous infusion of 0.1 mg of 1:10,000, given over 5 to 10 minutes. If more is required, begin infusion at 1 microgram per minute and titrate to effect. Stop intravenous infusion if arrhythmia or chest pain develops. The risk of cardiovascular complications is much greater for intravenous epinephrine. For beta-blocked patients, close blood pressure monitoring is suggested due to the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects from epinephrine. **IV Fluid Resuscitation** Anaphylaxis induces a distributive shock that typically is responsive to fluid resuscitation and the above epinephrine. One to 2 L or 10 to 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid bolus should be given for observed hypotension. Albumin or hypertonic solutions are not indicated. **Adjunctive Therapies** When anaphylaxis is diagnosed, co-treatment is often initiated with steroids, antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators, and vasopressors. Glucagon can also be used if indicated. These agents can assist in refractory initial anaphylaxis or prevent recurrence and biphasic reactions. **Corticosteroids** Corticosteroids are given to reduce the length or biphasic response of anaphylaxis. There is minimal literature to support this use, specifically in anaphylaxis, but it has been proven effective in reactive airway diseases. Therefore, the use, dosages, and proposed mechanism of action mimic those of airway management protocols. Methylprednisolone (80 to 125 mg IV) or hydrocortisone (250 to 500 mg IV) are the accepted treatments during the acute phase, after which oral treatment of prednisone (40 to 60 mg daily or divided twice per day) is continued for 3 to 5 days. Again, if the source is unknown or there is a concern for a prolonged time before physician follow-up, a steroid taper of up to 2 weeks may be provided. Mineralocorticoid activity is responsible for fluid retention; dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are the preferred agents for those at risk as they induce the least mineralocorticoid effect. **Antihistamines** Antihistamines are often routinely used; the most common is HÂ­1 blocker administration of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV/IM. While the clinical benefit is unproven in anaphylaxis, its utility
