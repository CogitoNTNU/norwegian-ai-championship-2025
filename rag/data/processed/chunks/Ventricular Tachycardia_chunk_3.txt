finding excludes both atrial tachycardia and AVRT. In atrial tachycardia, the atria initiate and maintain the tachycardia, so the number of atrial activations should be equal to or greater than the ventricular activations. In AVRT, atrial and ventricular activations occur in a 1:1 ratio due to the reentrant circuit involving the AV node and 1 or more accessory pathways. - Atrial beats exceeding ventricular beats - When atrial beats outnumber ventricular beats, AVRT can be excluded. In AVRT, each atrial beat is usually followed by a ventricular beat. A higher number of atrial beats suggests an alternate mechanism, such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. - Ventricular activation interval (septal time) - This interval measures the time between ventricular activation and the subsequent atrial activation at the septum. A septal V-A interval shorter than 70 milliseconds suggests that the SVT is unlikely to be caused by AVRT involving typical bypass tracts, which generally produce longer V-A intervals. In these cases, AVNRT is more likely to occur. - Atrial activation sequence - This refers to the pattern of atrial activation during tachycardia. A concentric pattern begins at the AV node and spreads outward. In contrast, an eccentric pattern—where the earliest activation occurs away from the septum—suggests the presence of a concealed accessory pathway. **Observations During Transitions** The following observations can be seen during transitions: - Initiation - How SVT begins can offer insights into its underlying mechanism. An A-H jump—a sudden increase in the interval from atrial to His bundle activation—indicates AV node involvement. This makes atrial tachycardia less likely, as it originates in the atria and does not depend on the AV node for its initiation. - Bundle branch block (BBB) - The presence of the BBB during tachycardia extends the ventricular activation interval in AVRT. Specifically, a prolongation of the ventricular activation interval of more than 35 milliseconds occurring alongside the appearance of BBB indicates orthodromic AVRT, especially when a free wall accessory pathway is ipsilateral to the BBB. - Termination - If the SVT terminates with an atrial event, it suggests atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia originates in the atria and is characterized by atrial impulses driving the tachycardia. Consequently, when atrial tachycardia terminates, it usually does so with an atrial event. - Conversely, AVNRT and AVRT may terminate with either an atrial or a ventricular event, depending on where the reentrant circuit is interrupted.
