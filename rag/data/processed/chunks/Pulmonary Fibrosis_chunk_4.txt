is common in patients with IPF, even in the absence of steroid use, and is closely associated with FVC and DLCO.[9] Low levels of Vitamin D are likely contributing factors to this phenomenon. Hypothyroidism is also more common in patients with IPF than in the general population, possibly related to increased underlying autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that this comorbidity serves as a poor prognostic indicator, underscoring the importance of screening all IPF patients for this highly treatable condition.[9][18][26] Moreover, the association between low thyroid hormones and pulmonary fibrosis may carry therapeutic implications. Anxiety and depression are common among patients with IPF. Anxiety levels often correlate with the degree of hypoxia experienced by the patient, while depression may be associated with the duration of diagnosis and overall quality of life.[9][18] ## Histopathology Histopathological confirmation for IPF may not always be necessary, but it should be considered if there are confounding factors, including cases where imaging shows an atypical UIP pattern (described below) or when there is suspicion of connective tissue disease. Bronchoscopic biopsy yields are typically low as the pathologic changes start subpleurally, and it is primarily useful for excluding other processes. Although bronchoscopic cryo-biopsies have been used more recently for pathologic diagnosis, surgical lung biopsy remains the gold standard when a biopsy is warranted.[27] However, in patients with advanced disease and respiratory failure, the risks associated with lung biopsy may be significant. The histology of IPF typically appears nonspecific, showing heterogeneous zones encompassing both normal and affected lung tissue. Interstitial inflammation, honeycomb changes, and fibrosis are commonly observed, although these alterations may also be present in other forms of advanced lung disease. To establish a histological diagnosis of IPF, the following criteria should be met:[28] - Presence of foci of fibroblasts - Evidence of honeycombing or disruption of lung architecture - Patchy involvement of the lung by fibrosis - The absence of other features suggests an alternative diagnosis IPF typically conforms to the pattern of UIP. Macroscopically, interstitial fibrosis appears in a patchwork pattern, with scarred lung areas juxtaposed with regions of normal lung architecture. Fibrosis is evident in the subpleural and periseptal areas, extending into the peribronchial parenchyma. Distortion of lung architecture due to scarring is a hallmark feature of UIP. Additionally, UIP is characterized by "honeycomb" changes, which consist of clusters of dilated, mucin-filled epithelial-lined airspaces set against a fibrotic background. Microscopically visible honeycomb changes are referred to as
