United Kingdom, and Australia, and 18% to 24% in Japan and Korea. The incidence is around 12% to 15% of cases per 1,00,000 per year. The incidence is high in low and middle-income countries and Asians. The incidence is more common in men and increases with age. The global incidence is increasing, predominantly in African and Asian countries. Japanese data have shown that control of hypertension reduces the incidence of ICH. The case fatality rate is 25% to 30% in high-income countries, while it is 30% to 48% in low- to middle-income countries. The ICH fatality rate depends on the efficacy of critical care. ## Pathophysiology The common sites of the bleed are the basal ganglia (50%), cerebral lobes (10% to 20%), the thalamus (15%), pons and the brain stem (10% to 20%), and the cerebellum(10%)(fig.1,2,3).[1] The hematoma disrupts the neurons and glia. This results in oligaemia, neuro-transmitter release, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular swelling. Thrombin activates microglia and causes inflammation and edema.[5][6] The primary injury is due to the compression of brain tissue by the hematoma and an increase in the intracranial pressure(ICP).[7] Secondary injury is contributed to by inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), edema, overproduction of free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and release of hemoglobin and iron from the clot. Usually, the hematoma enlarges in 3 hours to 12 hours. The enlargement of hematoma occurs in 3 hours in one-third of cases. The perihematomal edema increases within 24 hours, peaks around 5 to 6 days, and lasts up to 14 days. There is an area of hypoperfusion around the hematoma. The factors causing deterioration in ICH are an expansion of hematoma, intraventricular hemorrhage, perihematomal edema, and inflammation.[1] Cerebellar hematoma produces hydrocephalus by compression of the fourth ventricle in the early stage. Non-aneurysmal spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage may be either perimesencephalic or non-perimesencephalic SAH. In perimesencephalic SAH, bleeding is mainly in the interpeduncular cistern. Physical exertion, such as the Valsalva maneuver producing increased intrathoracic pressure, and elevated intracranial venous pressure, is a predisposing factor for perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH (PM-SAH).[8] There is diffuse blood distribution in non-perimesencephalic SAH (NPM-SAH).[9] ## History and Physical The common presentations of stroke are headache, aphasia, hemiparesis, and facial palsy.[10] The presentation of hemorrhagic stroke is usually acute and progressing. Acute onset headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, increases in blood pressure, and the rapidly developing neurological signs are the common clinical
