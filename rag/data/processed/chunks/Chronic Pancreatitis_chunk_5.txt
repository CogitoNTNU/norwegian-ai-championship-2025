to perform and is not widely available. - The fecal elastase test is widely available and practical. - Serum testing: - Trypsin or trypsinogen levels are no longer recommended, as they lack specificity and correlation with imaging findings. ## Treatment / Management The primary goals of treatment are managing pain and improving malabsorption. Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis arises from inflammation, neuropathic mechanisms, and ductal obstruction. Once established, chronic pain is typically persistent and lifelong without intervention and can be debilitating.[27] One of the most critical steps in management is encouraging alcohol cessation, as continued alcohol use can exacerbate pain and accelerate disease progression. Similarly, smoking cessation is vital and essential, as smoking is known to worsen the condition over time. Intervention is not clearly indicated when ductal strictures or stones are present, but the patient remains asymptomatic. However, if these obstructions cause symptoms, therapeutic options such as endoscopic procedures, surgical intervention, or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may be considered. **Pain Management of Chronic Pancreatitis** Pain management in chronic pancreatitis involves medical, endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical interventions. When imaging reveals ductal obstruction due to strictures or stones, the initial treatment approach should include endoscopy therapy or, in the case of stones, ESWL. Surgical intervention may be necessary if these interventions are unsuccessful or technically unfeasible. However, if no obstruction is identified, a trial of medical therapy is the recommended first-line approach.[28] **Medical management:** The initial approach to pain management in chronic pancreatitis should prioritize non-opioid medications before considering opioids. First-line options include acetaminophen or paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregabalin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants. Opioids should be avoided whenever possible due to the risks of dependence or addiction, tolerance, and adverse effects. However, they may be considered when non-opioid treatments prove ineffective or inadequate. Opioids should be prescribed in combination with non-opioid agents, particularly gabapentin, and initiated with a milder opioid such as tramadol, which has fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be more effective when combined with pregabalin. Antioxidant combinations—including selenium, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, L-methionine, and sometimes α-tocopherol—have demonstrated some effectiveness in pain relief in early chronic pancreatitis based on small studies. However, variability in formulations and dosages across studies limits definitive conclusions. Despite this, antioxidant therapy is safe and remains an option for some patients.[29][30] Pancreatic enzyme supplementation, although expensive, has not been proven effective in relieving pain associated with chronic pancreatitis.[31] However, it may
