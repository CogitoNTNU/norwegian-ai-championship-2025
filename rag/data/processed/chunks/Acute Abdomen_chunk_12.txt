specialists are critical to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Clinicians should not postpone specialty consultations while awaiting imaging results. Clinicians in the following specialties may be necessary depending on the underlying cause: - Infectious disease - Obstetrics and Gynecology - Urology - Vascular surgery - General surgery - Radiology and interventional radiology - Cardiology - Gastroenterology - Pulmonology - Thoracic surgery ## Deterrence and Patient Education Though most episodes of acute abdominal pain have a benign, self-limited etiology, some have an underlying serious cause. Because the differential diagnoses for abdominal pain are extensive, providing information regarding the symptoms of potentially life-threatening causes will help guide patients on when to seek immediate medical care. Patients should understand that the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain is a sign of a potentially serious underlying condition. Additional symptoms that should raise concern are nausea, vomiting, fever, blood in the stool or vomit, dark, tarry stools, or pain that worsens when someone bumps them or if they hit a bump in the road while riding in the car. Symptoms unique to children may be inconsolable crying or intermittent colicky pain. Patients can lower their risk of acute abdomen by adopting a healthy lifestyle, consuming a well-balanced diet, and limiting alcohol and tobacco use. Additionally, regularly monitoring chronic conditions such as gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease, along with following recommended screening guidelines for colon cancer and abdominal aortic aneurysms, can help prevent its occurrence. Clinicians should educate patients taking high-risk medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on the signs of adverse effects like peptic ulcer disease and when to seek medical care. Healthcare professionals must educate patients on the importance of following postoperative instructions. Proper patient education can prevent postoperative complications like wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Severe, often rapid onset abdominal pain that necessitates prompt evaluation and management characterizes an acute abdomen. Clinically, it may manifest as localized or diffuse pain, peritoneal signs such as guarding and rebound tenderness, hemodynamic instability, and associated symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fever, or altered bowel habits. A comprehensive history and physical examination, focusing on pain characteristics and risk factors, guide the initial diagnostic and management approach. Laboratory tests and imaging studies aid in diagnosis, with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria as a valuable tool in selecting the most effective imaging modality. These criteria enhance care quality, optimize radiology use, minimize
