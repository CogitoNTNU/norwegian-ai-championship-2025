present with prolonged constitutional symptoms. Although not found to be predictive, it is traditionally taught that patients with atypical bacterial pneumonia infections present gradually, often accompanied by a viral prodrome that includes a sore throat, headache, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fevers.[9] Atypical infections rarely have an obvious consolidation area on auscultation/imaging compared to pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, extra-cardiopulmonary symptoms are often observed; for example, _Mycoplasma_ infections have been associated with vasculitis and thrombosis, and _L._ _pneumophila_ is classically associated with gastrointestinal ailments and electrolyte abnormalities.[21][44][45] Despite the classical thought that bullous myringitis is associated with _M. pneumoniae_ , it has been rarely documented in the literature compared to typical bacteria such as _S. pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_. _M. pneumoniae_ is a significant cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia. Symptoms may include malaise, cough, myalgia, and sore throat. The cough is often dry and worsens at night, often appearing as intractable. Most cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection are mild and resolve on their own. _M. pneumoniae_ can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and cerebral ataxia.[21] Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax, or even respiratory distress syndrome. A parapneumonic effusion can be associated with restricted chest expansion on the affected side. _C. pneumoniae_ infection commonly presents with a sore throat, cough, and headache, persisting for several weeks or even months. In some individuals, it can lead to pneumonia, otitis media, and bronchitis.[24] Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[46] Asymptomatic infection may also occur and may only be evidenced by serosurveys. _L. pneumophila_ can be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections. Several serotypes exist, and infection tends to occur in close quarters.[36] Human-to-human transmission is rare; most cases are due to inhalation of the pathogen from contaminated water sources such as humidifiers, whirlpools, respiratory therapy equipment, water faucets, and air conditioners.[32][33] Stagnant water provides an environment for organisms to proliferate. Individuals at risk for _Legionella_ may have diabetes mellitus, malignancy, renal or liver failure, and those who have recently undergone plumbing work at home.[38] Once acquired, patients may present with altered mental status, cough, fever, and respiratory distress. Of the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, _Legionella_ species are more likely to have a severe course, and the illness can
