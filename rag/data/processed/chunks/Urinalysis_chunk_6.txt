However, a spot urine sample is much easier to obtain and can be a reasonable screening test. In a spot urine sample, a protein-to-creatinine ratio of 2 or higher (2 g of protein per gram of creatinine) suggests nephrotic syndrome but should be confirmed with a 24-hour urine test. Additionally, urine sediment may reveal casts upon microscopic examination. An underlying cause, such as a long history of clinically significant diabetes with related complications, may be evident. If diabetes has persisted for 5 years or more and diabetic neuropathy is present, diabetic nephropathy is a likely cause. If no clear underlying cause is identified, a renal biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. The likely issue is damage to the renal glomerular basement membrane. However, as treatment approaches differ, a biopsy is crucial to differentiate between minimal-change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Besides intrinsic renal disease, other potential causes include acute postinfectious nephritis, Alport syndrome, amyloidosis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, diabetes, infections (such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus), medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), preeclampsia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thrombotic microangiopathy.[20] Treatment depends on the underlying etiology.

Oxalate can be both endogenous and dietary; dietary oxalate is absorbed primarily in the colon and distal ileum. Normal oxalate excretion typically ranges from 40 to 50 mg/d, with 40 mg being a commonly accepted upper limit of normal. For managing stone formation, goals for oxalate reduction often aim for "optimal" levels of 25 mg/d or lower. Dietary sources of oxalate include black tea, nuts, chocolate, and green leafy vegetables such as spinach. Excessive vitamin C supplements can also be metabolized to oxalate in the urine, so limiting vitamin C intake to 1000 mg or less daily is advisable. Enteric hyperoxaluria, which can significantly increase the risk of stone formation, is associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, or previous bariatric bowel surgery.
