arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 60 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), about 90%. Uncontrolled oxygen supplementation can result in oxygen toxicity and CO2 (carbon dioxide) narcosis. The inspired oxygen concentration should be adjusted at the lowest level (90-94%), which is sufficient for tissue oxygenation. Oxygen can be delivered by several routes depending on the clinical situations in which we may use a nasal cannula, simple face mask, nonrebreathing mask, or high-flow nasal cannula. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be needed in refractory cases.[28] **Correction of Hypercapnia and Respiratory Acidosis** This may be achieved by treating the underlying cause or providing ventilatory support.[29] **Ventilatory Support** Patients with severe acute respiratory failure are usually intubated.\*\*\*\* The goals of ventilatory support in respiratory failure are to: - Correct hypoxemia - Correct acute respiratory acidosis - Resting of ventilatory muscles **Common Indications for Mechanical Ventilation Include the Following** - Apnea with respiratory arrest - Tachypnea with respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute - Disturbed conscious level or coma - Respiratory muscle fatigue - Hemodynamic instability - Failure of supplemental oxygen to increase PaO2 to 55 to 60 mmHg - Hypercapnia with arterial pH less than 7.25[30] The choice of invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support depends on the clinical situation, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and how severe it is.[31] It also depends on the underlying cause. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is preferred, particularly in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.[32][33][34][33][35][36] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for respiratory failure is broad and includes, but is not limited to, the following: - Acute respiratory distress syndrome - Aspiration pneumonia - Aspiration pneumonitis - Asthma - Atelectasis - Bacterial pneumonia - Bronchitis - Cardiogenic pulmonary edema - Cardiogenic shock - Central sleep apnea - Cervical cord injury - Cor pulmonale - Diaphragmatic paralysis - Distributive shock - Drug overdose - Emphysema - Fat embolism - Granulomatous lung disease - Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension - Kyphoscoliosis - Myxedema - Myocardial infarction - Neurogenic pulmonary edema - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome - Obstructive shock - Obstructive sleep apnea - Pleural effusion - Pneumothorax - Pulmonary fibrosis - Restrictive lung disease - Pneumoconiosis - Primary muscle disorders - Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Pulmonary embolism - Viral pneumonia ## Prognosis Respiratory failure is a syndrome caused by a multitude of pathological states; therefore, the prognosis of this disease process is
