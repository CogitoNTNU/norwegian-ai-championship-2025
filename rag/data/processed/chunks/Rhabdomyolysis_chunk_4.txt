have genetic susceptibility if exposed to external triggers. Mutations in the following genes are proposed to be associated with this risk: _ACADVL_ , _ANO5_ , _CPT2_ , _DMD_ , _DYSF_ , _FKRP_ , _HADHA_ , _PGM1_ , _LPIN1_ , _PYGM_ , and _RYR1._[12] Sickle cell trait affects 300 million people worldwide and also confers an increased risk. Rhabdomyolysis in people with sickle cell trait is especially common with exertional dyspnea. Patients with sickle cell disease are known to have rhabdomyolysis during sickle cell crises, and triggers should be avoided.[32][33][34] **Sepsis** Sepsis can cause rhabdomyolysis via multiple mechanisms, including direct muscle invasion by the infecting pathogen, muscle ischemia from hypoxia, toxin generation, and cytokine-mediated muscle toxicity. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is known to cause rhabdomyolysis by direct muscle invasion and toxin production. Streptococci, salmonellae, and _S aureus_ have been demonstrated in muscle biopsies of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Other pathogens associated with rhabdomyolysis include _Staphylococcus epidermidis,_ _Francisella tularensis, Streptococcus faecalis,_ meningococci _,_ _Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli,_ pseudomonads, _Klebsiella_ ,_Enterococcus faecalis,_ and _Bacteroides._[35] ## Epidemiology Approximately 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported each year in the United States. There is a large variation in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with rhabdomyolysis; AKI is inconsistently defined, and the degree of rhabdomyolysis is highly variable.[36] Rhabdomyolysis can occur at any age, but most cases are seen in adults. Men, Black individuals, patients older than 60 years, and individuals with obesity are at increased risk. The most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in children is infection (30%). The incidence of crush syndrome is between 30% to 50% with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Children are at low risk for crush syndrome and have lower mortality rates compared to adults. Crush injury-related AKI and dialysis requirements varied across multiple studies. During natural disasters like earthquakes, early fluid resuscitation, extrication, and immediate hospitalization with a multidisciplinary team approach reduce AKI, morbidity, and mortality. In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the National Heart-Lung and Blood Institute, and the American Heart Association jointly released a clinical advisory. It defined statin-associated rhabdomyolysis as muscle symptoms with increased creatine kinase, typically more than 11 times the upper limit of normal (myonecrosis) with elevated serum creatinine consistent with pigment-induced nephropathy and myoglobinuria.[37] About 0.5% of patients taking statins might develop clinically significant myonecrosis.[38] The incidence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to immobilization, alcohol intoxication, fractures, strenuous muscle exercises, and insect bites is imprecise, as these
