most common ones are discussed in this section. **Acute Lung Injury** Acute lung injury is a well-known complication of heroin overdose. However, this condition may also occur after overdoses involving methadone and propoxyphene and is almost universally observed in patients who succumb to high doses of opiates. The exact mechanism by which opiates cause lung injury remains unclear, but the outcome is hypoventilation and hypoxia caused by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Clinically, heroin-induced lung injury presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, frothy sputum production, cyanosis, tachypnea, and ralesâ€”symptoms consistent with pulmonary edema. Acute lung injury has also been reported in children who ingest high doses of opiates. The presentation is very similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most cases resolve with aggressive airway management and oxygen therapy, including positive pressure ventilation. Standard medications for pulmonary edema are typically avoided, as diuretics may worsen hypotension.[42] **Infection** Complications of intravenous opioid use include abscesses, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Gram-positive bacteria, such as _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus,_ are the most common organisms involved. If these bacteria enter the systemic circulation, the risk of additional complications like epidural abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis increases. These conditions often present with symptoms such as fever and persistent back pain. Some individuals who inject drugs directly into the neck risk developing jugular vein thrombophlebitis, Horner syndrome, and pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery. Both peripheral and pulmonary emboli have been reported in people who inject opioids. Accidental injection into nerves may also cause permanent neuropathy. Endocarditis is a serious complication of intravenous drug use, often resulting from injecting illicit drug mixtures with contaminated needles. Diagnosing infectious endocarditis can be challenging due to the initially vague symptoms. While right-sided heart valves are most commonly affected, left-sided valves may also be involved in some cases. The tricuspid valve is the valve most frequently affected in individuals who use intravenous drugs. Endocarditis often presents with fever, malaise, and a new murmur. In some patients, recurrent septic pulmonary embolism may be the only presenting feature. The organism most commonly involved in right-sided endocarditis is _Staphylococcus aureus_. In contrast, left-sided endocarditis may be polymicrobial, involving organisms such as _Streptococcus_ , _E. coli_ , _Pseudomonas_ , and _Klebsiella_. Symptoms and signs tend to be more pronounced in left-sided endocarditis compared to right-sided cases. Other infectious manifestations of opioid abuse include recurrent pneumonia, with aspiration pneumonia occurring in some unconscious individuals. Necrotizing fasciitis, another life-threatening complication, often
