of 2 to 5 U/L. The mobility of CK isoenzymes at pH 8.6 toward the anode is BB > MB > MM, with the MM remaining cathodic to the point of application.[26] The discriminating power of electrophoresis also allows the detection of abnormal CK bands (eg, macro-CK). The disadvantages of electrophoresis include the long turnaround time, labor intensity, incompatibility with clinical chemistry analyzers in emergencies, and required interpretative skills.[27] Immunochemical methods apply to the direct measurement of CK-MB. In the immunoinhibition technique, an anti-CK-M subunit antiserum is used to inhibit both M subunits of CK-MM and the single M subunit of CK-MB, determining the enzyme activity of the B subunit of CK-MB, the B subunits of CK-BB, and macro-CKs. This technique assumes the absence of CK-BB (and other sources of interference such as macro-CKs) from the tested serum to determine CK-MB.[28] Because the CK-B subunit accounts for half the CK-MB activity, the change in absorbance should be doubled to obtain the measure of CK-MB activity. This results in a significant decrease in the analytical sensitivity of the method. If present, atypical macro-CK may result in falsely elevated CK-MB results. Owing to its low sensitivity and specificity, the immunoinhibition technique is supplanted mainly by mass assays of CK-MB.[29] In contrast with immunoinhibition, which measures the CK-MB isoenzyme by determination of its catalytic activity, mass immunoassays measure CK-MB protein concentrations.[30] Several mass assays using various labels are now commercially available and used for routine CK-MB determination. Measurements use the “sandwich” technique, where the antibody specifically recognizes the MB dimer. The sandwich technique ensures that only CK-MB is estimated because neither CK-MM nor CK-BB reacts with both antibodies. Mass assays are more sensitive than activity-based methods, with a detection limit for CK-MB usually \<1 μg/L.[31] Other advantages include sample stability, noninterference with hemolysis, drugs, or other catalytic activity inhibitors, full automation, and fast turnaround time.[32] ## Interfering Factors A moderate degree of hemolysis (up to 0.32 g/dL of hemoglobin) does not significantly influence the measured CK activity because erythrocytes contain no CK activity.[33] However, severely hemolyzed specimens are unsatisfactory because enzymes and intermediates (AK, ATP, and glucose-6-phosphate) liberated from the erythrocytes may affect the lag phase and the side reactions in the assay system. Turbid and icteric samples can be analyzed; appropriate values are obtained if the starting absorbance is not too high.[34] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings Serum CK activity is
