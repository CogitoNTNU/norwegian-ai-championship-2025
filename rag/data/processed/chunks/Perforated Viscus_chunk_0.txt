Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum). While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. This activity will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective and also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. - Outline the presentation of a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer. - Summarize the treatment options for perforated peptic ulcers. - Explain the importance of care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by perforated peptic ulcers.

Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the stomach and duodenum though they can occasionally be found elsewhere (esophagus or Meckel diverticulum).[1] While the majority of peptic ulcers are initially asymptomatic, clinical manifestations range from mild dyspepsia to complications including GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction. Peptic ulcers may be either duodenal or gastric in location. This article will provide a brief overview of peptic ulcer disease with a primary focus on the complexity of perforated peptic ulcers from an emergency medicine perspective. ## Etiology Peptic ulcer disease was traditionally thought to be the result of increased acid production, dietary factors, and even stress. However, Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including low-dose aspirin are now the more popular etiologies
