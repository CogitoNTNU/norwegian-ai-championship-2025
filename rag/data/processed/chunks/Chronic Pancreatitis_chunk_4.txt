- Pancreatic biopsies The 72-hour quantitative fecal fat collection is the most definitive test for advanced pancreatic insufficiency to evaluate steatorrhea. A fecal fat excretion of greater than 7 g/d confirms the diagnosis. Alternatively, a fecal elastase-1 level can be performed using a single random stool sample to assess pancreatic insufficiency.[24] - Normal fecal elastase level: > 500 µg/g of stool - Borderline range: 200 to 500 µg/g (nonspecific, may be normal) - Moderate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: 100 to 200 µg/g - Severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: \<100 µg/g Although neither test is highly accurate, fecal elastase testing is less reliable than the 72-hour fecal fat collection but is more practical and widely used in clinical practice. For patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis-related pain, and signs of maldigestion, such as steatorrhea or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, confirmatory imaging with CT or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography testing (MRCP) should be the initial diagnostic step. **Diagnostic Algorithm** - MRCP and CT are the preferred imaging modalities. - Detect calcifications (hallmark sign), pancreatic enlargement, and ductal obstruction or dilation. - MRCP is more sensitive and specific for chronic pancreatitis than transabdominal ultrasound or plain x-rays, though both can reveal calcifications. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an alternative, particularly for early chronic pancreatitis before fibrosis develops. - More invasive and less specific than MRCP or CT. - Reserved for cases where MRCP or CT is nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion remains high.[23][25][26] - Secretin-enhanced MRCP may be used if standard imaging and EUS are inconclusive. - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was the previous gold standard but is now largely supplanted by MRCP. - This technique is still used if therapeutic intervention, such as biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy, stent placement, or stone extraction, is needed. - Pancreatic biopsy is indicated if clinical suspicion is high, but imaging remains nondiagnostic. - Direct and indirect exocrine function tests can be performed at any point in the diagnostic process but should complement imaging studies rather than replace them.[24] - Direct pancreatic function tests: - The cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation test measures trypsin or lipase and is sensitive to early exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. However, it is limited in availability and uncomfortable for patients. - Endoscopic secretin stimulation test measures bicarbonate secretion but requires upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, making it costly and invasive. - Indirect pancreatic function tests: - The 13C-mixed triglyceride test is 90% sensitive but takes up to 6 hours
