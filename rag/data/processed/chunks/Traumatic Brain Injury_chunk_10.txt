or 1 (shift > 5mm). Those with a score of 1 have been found to have lower mortality, 3.2%, while those with a score of 6 can have mortalities of almost 80%.[51] Research studies such as the International Mission for Prognosis And Clinical Trial (IMPACT), TRACK-TBI, and CENTER-TBI have developed prognostic scoring systems to aid outcome prediction.[6][52] Interestingly, genomics plays a role in head trauma outcomes, with approximately 25% of the variance attributed to genetic factors.[21] Advancements in patient management now include the monitoring of partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) and cerebral metabolism through microdialysis, alongside focused management of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).[53] The importance of early and continuous rehabilitation in improving long-term clinical outcomes cannot be overstated, emphasizing the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to precision medicine.[21] Additionally, machine learning is emerging as a valuable tool in predicting adverse outcomes and mortality.[54][55][56] For mild traumatic brain injury(concussion), potential physical sequelae include postconcussive syndrome, which is thought to occur in 80% of patients; second impact syndrome, a rare disorder that results in rapid cerebral edema and high mortality; posttraumatic epilepsy; and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In those suffering from sports-related mild TBI (concussion), most symptoms (>70%) resolve within three days to two weeks, with the rest improving within four weeks.[57][58] Although adolescent females have a higher incidence rate and risk of injury from sport-related concussions, adolescent females and males usually recover at the same rate following TBI. It has been noted in some reports that females report more neurobehavioral and somatic symptoms, and males report more cognitive symptoms like confusion and amnesia.[57][59][60] The assessment of adolescents and those playing sports following a concussion should follow a physician-directed return-to-play progression prior to returning to sport. These guidelines and recommendations can be found through various consensus statements like that of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM).[61] Following the completion of the six return-to-sport (RTS) strategy steps, with each step taking about 24 hours to complete, the medical determination to return to sport or at-risk activity can be concluded. ## Complications - Brain death - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (especially in military personnel and athletes related to contact sports) [62] - CNS infection [63] - CSF leaks [64] - Dementia [65] - Deep vein thrombosis - Depression and PTSD [66] - Dyselectrolytemia (eg, cerebral salt wasting and SIADH) [67][68][67] - Endocrinopathies such as hypopituitarism [69]
