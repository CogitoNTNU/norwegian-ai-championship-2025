for AMI, with certain states experiencing poorer results. Lagging states exhibit higher incidence and prevalence rates of AMI, increased mortality associated with AMI, and lower life expectancy overall.[9] Compared with the developed world, South-Asian countries face a relatively higher burden of AMI and coronary artery disease (CAD).[10] CAD remains a significant public health concern. According to 2013 data, cardiovascular disease, including CAD, accounts for approximately 1 in every 3 deaths in the United States.[11] For every hospitalized patient with MI, an estimated 30 patients have stable angina. Furthermore, the prevalence of CAD increases with age for both men and women.[12] While the prevalence of CAD has not decreased, the mortality rate from MI has declined. This encouraging trend can be attributed to advancements in treatment strategies and improved management of MI. According to a study, it was found that the incidence of anterior ST-elevation MI (STEMI) accounts for approximately 33% of all STEMIs.[13] Additionally, the incidence of cardiogenic shock in AMI ranges from 5% to 15%.[14] ## Pathophysiology Erosion or rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque in LAD leads to thrombus formation. Erosion of the plaque exposes thrombogenic lipid core or subendothelial tissue, leading to enhanced vascular inflammatory activity and thrombus formation.[15] The disruption of endothelial continuity facilitates the accumulation of thrombogenic blood components, forming a thrombus. The integrity of the fibrous cap is maintained through a delicate equilibrium between collagen synthesis and degradation. Various cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage chemoattractant proteins, and macrophage colony-stimulating factors, participate in the inflammatory response. The central region of the thrombus is predominantly composed of platelets, giving it a 'white' appearance. In contrast, the proximal and distal ends of the thrombus appear 'red' due to the accumulation of fibrin and red blood cells. A thrombus and vasospasm can reduce blood supply to the myocardium, leading to ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction. The consequences of acute myocardial infarction arise as a result of the following series of pathophysiological events: **Systolic dysfunction and cardiogenic shock** : Disruption in the blood supply along the LAD leads to compromised myocardium contractility. Consequently, several manifestations may occur, including dyssynchrony (uncoordinated contraction of different myocardial segments), hypokinesia (reduced endocardial thickening), akinesia (absent endocardial thickening), or dyskinesia (paradoxical endocardial motion and bulging of the endocardial layer). The non-infarcted segments of the myocardium may exhibit compensatory hyperkinesia, which usually resolves in 2 weeks following the ischemic insult. Ischemia in remote
