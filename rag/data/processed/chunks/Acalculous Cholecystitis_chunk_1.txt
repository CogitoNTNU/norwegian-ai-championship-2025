care unit. Acute acalculous cholecystitis can be a life-threatening disorder that has a high risk of perforation and necrosis compared to the more typical calculous disease.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Gallbladder dysfunction in the absence of gallstones has a multifactorial etiology. Long periods of fasting, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and drastic weight loss can all increase the incidence of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Often, other more serious conditions are present. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) recovering from major surgeries or other life-threatening ailments, eg, a stroke, heart attack, sepsis, severe burns, and extensive trauma, are all at a higher risk of developing acute acalculous cholecystitis. Gallbladder stasis can develop due to a lack of gallbladder stimulation by cholecystokinin (CCK), leading to the concentration of bile salts and increased pressure within the gallbladder. The elevated pressure leads to hypoperfusion and ischemia of the gallbladder wall that eventually causes pressure necrosis and perforation if prompt intervention is not initiated. This static condition also increases the seeding and growth of common enteric pathogens, eg, _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus faecali_ s.[4] Individuals with chronic acalculous cholecystitis may have decreased gallbladder emptying or hypokinetic biliary dyskinesia due to a variety of factors, including hormone imbalance, vasculitis, and decreased nerve innervation secondary to conditions such as diabetes. Often, the exact etiology of chronic acalculous cholecystitis is unknown.[5][6] ## Epidemiology Acute acalculous cholecystitis accounts for 10% of all cases of acute cholecystitis and 5% to 10% of all cases of cholecystitis. Males are more commonly afflicted than females, with a mean age of 50.[7] Despite the close relationship between acute acalculous cholecystitis and critical illness, studies have shown that individuals with underlying vascular disease can develop acute acalculous cholecystitis in the outpatient setting.[8] Rates are increased in HIV and other immunosuppressed patients. These individuals are more susceptible to opportunistic infections, including microsporidia, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Cryptosporidium, and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which can seed and flourish in bile within the gallbladder. Carriers of _Giardia lamblia, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella typhi_ are also associated with increased risks of developing cholecystitis.[9][10] ## Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of acute acalculous cholecystitis is complex, with the interplay of several mechanisms. Prolonged fasting and long-term TPN seen in critically ill patients can lead to biliary stasis within the gallbladder due to the lack of CCK stimulation.[11] Stasis of the gallbladder results in the build-up of intraluminal pressure against the gallbladder wall and
