without a change in symptoms or physical examination - Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance in patients with a previous history of pulmonary embolism with normal right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure **Absolute Contraindications Of Transesophageal Echocardiography** - History of esophageal stricture, perforation, tumor, laceration, and diverticulum - History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding - Severe atlantoaxial joint disorder - Conditions that prevent neck flexion **Inappropriate Transesophageal Echocardiography Indications** - Routine use of transesophageal echocardiography in patients in whom decisions regarding diagnosis and management are already resolved by transthoracic echocardiography - To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with low pretest probability - To rule out cardiovascular sources such as embolus in patients with an obvious cardiac cause - Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in whom the decision to anticoagulant already made **Conditions In Which Stress Echocardiography Are Inappropriate** - Patients with low pre-test probability for coronary artery disease - Patients with definite acute coronary syndrome ## Equipment **Equipment Requirement for Transthoracic Echocardiography** - Echocardiography machine - Transducer - Contrast agent [7] **Equipment Requirement for Transesophageal Echocardiography** - Echocardiography machine - Transesophageal transducer - Medication for sedation - Transesophageal bite block - Intravenous cannula for medications - For the bubble study: agitated saline, 3-way stop cock, 2 10 ml syringes, and an extension tube connector - Gel to lubricate transesophageal probe - Topic anesthetics such as lidocaine to numb the pharynx [8] **Equipment Requirement for Stress Echocardiography** - Echocardiography machine - Exercise stress test machine - Cardiac monitor to look for vitals - Medications (such as dobutamine and atropine) to give stress in patients who can not perform an exercise stress test and medications (such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) to reverse the effect of dobutamine and atropine ## Personnel Personnel required to perform and interpret an echocardiogram include: - Cardiologist - Echocardiogram technician ## Technique or Treatment For transthoracic echocardiography, the patient should lie in the left lateral position. ## Complications The complications from transthoracic echocardiography and stress echocardiography are infrequent. **Transesophageal Echocardiography** 1. Gastrointestinal bleeding 1. Esophageal perforation 1. Pharyngeal hematoma 1. Aspiration 1. Laryngospasm 1. Arrhythmia 1. Toxic methemoglobinemia [9][10] **Stress Echocardiography** 1. Myocardial infarction 1. Arrhythmia 1. Coronary spasm 1. Hypertension or hypotension secondary to medication [11][12] ## Clinical Significance **Transthoracic echocardiography** : a non-invasive, low-cost, widely available, first-line diagnostic test to evaluate cardiac disease and function. It not only helps to diagnose
