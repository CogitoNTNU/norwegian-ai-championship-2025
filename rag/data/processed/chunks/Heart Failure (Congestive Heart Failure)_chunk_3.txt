as arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, further compelling the identification of underlying disorders. Many of these conditions have a genetic basis, and a detailed family history of sudden cardiac death, especially in first-degree relatives older than 35 years, should be taken. Over 50 identified genes contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy alone. Genetic determinants have variable phenotypic expression, and many nongenetic factors also affect the clinical symptoms. Some of these factors include diabetes, toxic exposure, or pregnancy. Fabry disease is a rare glycogen storage disease that can cause CHF symptoms through a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pattern.[3][6] **Inflammatory cardiomyopathy** Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis along with ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. The most common cause is viral infection. Other etiologies are bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infections; toxic substances or drugs; and immune-mediated diseases. Chagas disease is caused by _Trypanosoma cruzi,_ which is endemic in Latin America \_\_ and commonly causes myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and CHF. Other viral causes of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy include adenoviruses, enteroviruses, herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Viruses can also activate autoimmune myocarditis, including HIV, hepatitis C virus, influenzas A and B, and coronaviruses (including COVID-19). When associated with CHF, these conditions tend to have a poor prognosis.[7] **Infiltrative cardiomyopathies** Infiltrative cardiomyopathies cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern (similar to the genetically determined restrictive cardiomyopathy variant), which is notable for normal ventricular systolic function but with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling dynamics. This is often associated with a high E/A ratio showing increased early filling and delayed late filling.[6][8] Cardiac amyloidosis results from misfolded protein deposits in the heart; this leads to cardiomyocyte separation, cellular toxicity, and tissue stiffness. Patients are preload dependent and are prone to symptomatic hypotension. Currently, tamifidis is the only medication known to prevent cardiac amyloidosis. It prevents, but does not reverse, amyloid deposition. Its high cost is also a limiting factor.[1][9] Sarcoidosis is an acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by conduction defects and arrhythmias caused by the formation of granulomas. The most common cardiac manifestation is CHF. Due to the associated conduction abnormalities, beta-blockers must be used with caution. Cardiac hemochromatosis is present in 15% to 20% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition initially presents with a restrictive pattern but develops into biventricular systolic dysfunction.[8] Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy physiology can develop hypotension when treated with traditional CHF medications due to preload dependence, so caution
