IV hydration, nasogastric decompression, and pain control are often required. The use of antibiotics depends on the specific diagnosis. Close monitoring is essential, as patients may develop complications such as atelectasis, ileus, wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pneumonia. ## Consultations When treating a patient with an acute abdomen, timely and appropriate consultations with
