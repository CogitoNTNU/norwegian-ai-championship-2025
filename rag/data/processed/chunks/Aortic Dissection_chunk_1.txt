more than 2 weeks, have a slightly better prognosis. While the classic presentation of acute aortic dissection involves sudden, severe, “tearing” chest pain, subtle presentations often lead to missed diagnoses. Despite the literature, many aortic dissections are missed in the emergency department; only 15% to 43% of verified cases are accurately diagnosed at first presentation.[1][2][3] Without treatment, mortality approaches 50% within 48 hours of symptom onset. Despite its rarity, acute aortic dissection requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary healthcare intervention, with better outcomes observed in high-volume centers utilizing experienced teams, “aorta code” protocols, and specialized aortic centers.[4] Further, implementing a multidisciplinary strategy with vascular surgery and cardiology expertise is essential to improving patient outcomes in these life-threatening cases. Aortic dissections are classified anatomically by 2 systems: the Stanford and DeBakey classification systems. The Stanford system categorizes dissections into 2 types based on whether the ascending or descending part of the aorta is involved (see **Image.** Stanford Classification of Aortic Dissection). - **Stanford Type A:** This\*\*\*\* involves the ascending aorta, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear (see **Image.** Type A Aortic Dissection), and is defined as a dissection proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. - **Stanford Type B:** This originates distal to the left subclavian artery and involves only the descending aorta; the Society for Vascular Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons define Stanford type B dissections as those where the entry tear occurs beyond the origin of the innominate artery.[5] The DeBakey system further subdivides dissections into 3 types based on the origin and extent of the dissection: - **DeBakey Type 1:** Originates in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta - **DeBakey Type 2:** Originates in and is limited to the ascending aorta - **DeBakey Type 3:** Begins in the descending aorta and extends distally above the diaphragm (type 3a) or below the diaphragm (type 3b) Ascending dissections (Stanford type A or DeBakey types 1 and 2) are nearly twice as common as descending dissections (Stanford type B or DeBakey type 3), necessitating an urgent, specialized approach to reduce the risk of fatal complications such as aortic rupture, stroke, or myocardial infarction (see **Image.** Aortic Dissection, Type A).[6] ## Etiology Predisposing high-risk factors for nontraumatic aortic dissection include: - Hypertension (occurs in 70% of patients with distal Stanford type B dissections) - An abrupt, transient, severe increase in blood pressure (eg, strenuous weight lifting and use
