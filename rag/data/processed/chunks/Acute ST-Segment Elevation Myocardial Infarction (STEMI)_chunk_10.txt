considerations in managing STEMI include the following: - Chest pain or discomfort: This symptom is the primary trigger for the diagnostic and treatment processes in acute coronary syndrome. - Coordination between emergency medical services and hospitals: Effective STEMI management relies on the seamless coordination between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals, facilitated by standardized written protocols. EMS should notify the PCI center as soon as a reperfusion strategy is decided, and the patient should be directly transferred to the PCI center, bypassing the emergency department. - Invasive strategy: An invasive approach is advised for patients with ACS due to the condition's time-sensitive nature. Immediate invasive intervention is strongly recommended for STEMI. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes A door-to-balloon time of less than 90 minutes is the goal of a PCI-capable facility. This parameter is one of the core measures of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.[69] The door-to-balloon time is the time between the patient's arrival in the emergency department and the crossing of the culprit lesion by a guide wire in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Teamwork between EMS, emergency department physicians, and interventional cardiologists sets the groundwork for optimal door-to-balloon times. The median door-to-balloon time in 2010 was 64 minutes, with 91% of patients receiving PCI in under 90 minutes and 70% in under 75 minutes.[70] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17173&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17173) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-heart-attack-with-ecg-changes/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17173) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17173/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17173) [![ ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction on Electrocardiogram](/books/NBK532281/bin/12_Lead_EKG_ST_Elevation_tracing_color_coded.gif)](/books/NBK532281/figure/article-17173.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK532281/figure/article-17173.image.f1/?report=objectonly) ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction on Electrocardiogram.
