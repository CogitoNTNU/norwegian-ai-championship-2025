These triglycerides are embedded in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons traveling through the bloodstream. The role of lipoprotein lipase is significant in understanding the pathophysiology of type one familial dyslipidemias, or hyperchylomicronemia, and its clinical manifestations. LPL also plays an essential role in understanding the cardiac pharmacology of fibrates as a class of medications and in managing patients with high levels of serum triglycerides. This review will explore lipoprotein lipase's function, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance.[1] ## Molecular Level The structure of lipoprotein lipase is similar to the enzymes in the lipase family and comprises two distinct regions. LPL has an N-terminal domain with a lipolytic active site and a C-terminal domain. These two regions attach using a peptide link. Recent x-ray crystallography and biochemical experiments have provided more structural evidence revealing that lipoprotein lipase can be active as a monomer.[2][3] Also, Cryo-EM studies have shown that the inactive form of lipoprotein lipase is a polymer.[4] ## Function Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that degrades circulating triglycerides in the bloodstream. These triglycerides are embedded in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons traveling through the bloodstream. Lipoprotein lipase is an extracellular enzyme on the vascular endothelial surface, anchored to capillary walls. This enzyme is predominantly in adipose tissue, muscle, and heart tissue but not in the liver, as the liver has hepatic lipase. Lipoprotein functions to convert triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids liberated from the triglycerides are then used for storage in adipose tissue or fuel in skeletal or cardiac muscle. Lipoprotein lipase requires apolipoprotein-CII, a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, which is carried by a chylomicron as well as by very low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), for activation. Lipoprotein lipase will shrink the chylomicrons by removing the fatty acids from triglycerides, which are transferred to adipocytes and skeletal muscle. At the same time, the liver takes up the chylomicron remnants via receptor-mediated endocytosis.[1] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of lipoprotein lipase is evident in
