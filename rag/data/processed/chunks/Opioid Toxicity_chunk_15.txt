not required. Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescriber's DEA number without requiring a DATA 2000 waiver. However, depending on the pharmacy, dispensing software may still prompt for X-Waiver information to proceed. Practitioners must also adhere to any applicable state regulations regarding the treatment of patients with OUD. Contact information for State Opioid Treatment Authorities can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/medicationassisted-treatment/sota. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of opioid poisoning includes conditions presenting with sudden-onset respiratory or CNS depression, as follows: - Barbiturate toxicity - Benzodiazepine toxicity - Carbon monoxide toxicity - Clonidine toxicity - Cyanide toxicity - Diabetic ketoacidosis - Ethanol toxicity - Ethylene glycol toxicity - Î³-Hydroxybutyrate toxicity - Hypercalcemia - Hypernatremia - Hypothermia - Hypoglycemia - Meningitis/encephalitis - Neuroleptic agent toxicity - Traumatic brain injury - Valproic acid toxicity Efficient and thorough evaluation of these alternative diagnoses ensures timely intervention and better outcomes. ## Prognosis **Mortality and Morbidity** Death from opioid overdose is on the rise. One study found that deaths from opioid-only overdose increased by 384% between 1999 and 2018. Polysubstance overdose deaths increased by 760% over the same period in adolescents and young adults.[38] According to the CDC, nearly 108,000 individuals succumbed to opioid overdose in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic response also led to an increase in mortality, as it limited access to treatment services. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality following an opiate overdose is respiratory arrest. Seizures, acute lung injury, and adverse cardiac events may also occur but are less common. Individuals with preexisting lung pathology who overdose on opiates face a significantly higher risk of respiratory distress and death compared to the general population. Another factor contributing to opiate toxicity is the presence of coingestants, with the eventual toxicity depending on the type of substance involved. A Canadian study found that the risk of fatal opiate toxicity doubled when opiates were taken with gabapentin, which is also known to depress respiration. Additionally, morbidity and mortality are influenced by the intent behind the opiate ingestion. Individuals attempting suicide often consume multiple drugs simultaneously, substantially increasing the risk of death. **Prognosis** If the patient does arrest in the setting of a pure opiate overdose, the cause in most cases is severe hypotension, hypoxia, and poor brain perfusion. The outcome for these individuals is poor. ## Complications Opiate toxicity can also produce complications beyond the typical respiratory and CNS adverse effects.[39][40][41] The
