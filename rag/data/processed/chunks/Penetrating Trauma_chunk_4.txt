to the brain. The sound blasts may be associated with high pressures or blast overpressure, which can harm the outer ear, ear canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear ossicles. These explosions may also generate strong blast winds or pressure gradients. Additionally, penetrating ballistic injuries can occur alongside the sound blast, causing blunt trauma. Lastly, explosions can expose individuals to toxic substances from gases, fuels, or metals, potentially resulting in burns to otologic structures. AAT can occur in occupational settings, such as the military, or environmental contexts, such as exposure to gunfire or work-related blasts.[15] Depending on the intensity and characteristics of AAT, hearing loss may be permanent despite treatment. Genetic factors contribute to individual susceptibility to NIHL and AAT, including the _Ahl_ gene, CDH23 (which encodes cadherin 23), myosin 14, and other related genes.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] ## Epidemiology A 2019 study by the OSHA Information System revealed that from 1972 to 2019, there were 119,305 violations of OSHA noise standards related to occupational noise exposure in general industry.[23] More males than females are reported to have NIHL, with no significant age differences noted. Many individuals with occupational hearing loss also experience depression and sleep disorders.[24] Recreational firearm use in the United States is more prevalent than in any other country in the world. Many individuals may be unaware of the associated hazards, as nearly all firearms produce peak impulse noise levels exceeding 140 dB. According to the Aural Blast Injury/Acoustic Trauma and Hearing Loss guidelines, AAT contributes to veteran disability at an annual rate of 13% to 18% in the United States.[25] A retrospective study of French military personnel assessed the prevalence of long-term hearing loss in individuals exposed to AAT. Audiograms taken an average of 448 days after AAT indicated a long-term hearing loss prevalence exceeding 20%.[26] Another study examined hearing loss following a single episode of AAT, estimating a 1% incidence of hearing loss over a 20-year follow-up period.[27] ## Pathophysiology Prolonged exposure to loud noise can result in hearing loss, whether acute or chronic. Overstimulation of hair cells may cause mechanical damage to the cochlea, reduce blood flow due to the formation of vasoactive lipid products, and trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. Acoustic overstimulation leads to excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which interferes with the functioning of the cochlea. This disruption can cause swelling of the stria vascularis and depolymerization of actin filaments in the stereocilia, leading
