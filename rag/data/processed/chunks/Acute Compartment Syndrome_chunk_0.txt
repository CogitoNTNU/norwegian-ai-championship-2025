Without prompt treatment, acute compartment syndrome can lead to ischemia and eventually, necrosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the body parts most commonly affected by acute compartment syndrome and the expected corresponding symptoms. - Explain how to evaluate a patient for acute compartment syndrome. - Outline how to treat acute compartment syndrome. - Review the need for a well-integrated, well-coordinated interprofessional team approach when caring for patients with acute compartment syndrome.

Acute compartment syndrome is considered a **surgical emergency** since, without proper treatment, it can lead to ischemia and eventually necrosis. Generally, acute compartment syndrome is considered a clinical diagnosis. However, intracompartmental pressure (ICP) > 30 mmHg can be used as a threshold to aid in diagnosis. However, a single normal ICP reading does not exclude acute compartment syndrome. Fascia is a thin, inelastic sheet of connective tissue that surrounds muscle compartments and limits the capacity for rapid expansion. In the leg, there are four muscle compartments: anterior, lateral, deep posterior, and superficial posterior. The **anterior compartment of the leg** is the most common location for compartment syndrome. This compartment contains the extensor muscles of the toes, the tibialis anterior muscle, the deep peroneal nerve, and the tibial artery. Other locations in which acute compartment syndrome is seen include the forearm, thigh, buttock, shoulder, hand, and foot. It can also be seen in the abdomen, but more commonly, it presents in the limbs. [1][2][3][4][5] Significant attention should be paid to patients with open fractures. Recent retrospective studies indicate that skin laceration would not relieve the pressure inside the muscle
