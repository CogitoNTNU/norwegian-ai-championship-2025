population. Yet other studies show no difference in outcome and theorize that patients at greatest risk from cerebral edema present at a later stage and are the most severe volume depleted.[29] _Maintainance:_ The subsequent choice for fluid replacement depends on hemodynamics, the state of hydration, serum electrolyte levels, and urinary output.[1] In patients who have high serum sodium level, 0.45% NaCl infused at 4–14 ml/kg/hour or 250–500 mL/hr is appropriate, and for patients with hyponatremia, 0.9% NaCl at a similar rate is preferred.[30] Maintenance fluids may need to be adjusted if hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis becomes a concern, then you can switch to the Ringer lactate solution. **Insulin Therapy** The discovery of insulin, along with the antibiotics, has led to a drastic decrease in mortality with DKA, down to 1%. Intravenous insulin by continuous infusion is the standard of care. Previous treatment protocols have recommended the administration of an initial bolus of 0.1 U/kg, followed by the infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h. A more recent prospective randomized trial demonstrated that a bolus is not necessary if patients are given hourly insulin infusion at 0.14 U/kg/hr.[31] When the plasma glucose reaches 200-250 mg/dl, and if the patient still has an anion gap, then dextrose containing fluids should be initiated, and the insulin infusion rate may need to be reduced. Treatment of adult patients who have uncomplicated, mild diabetic ketoacidosis can be treated with subcutaneous insulin lispro hourly in a non-intensive care setting may be safe and cost-effective as opposed to treatment with intravenous regular insulin in the intensive care setting as shown in many studies.[32] In one of these studies, the patients received subcutaneous insulin lispro at a dose of 0.3 U/kg initially, followed by 0.1 U/kg every hour until blood glucose was less than 250 mg/dl. Then insulin dose was decreased to 0.05 or 0.1 U/kg given every hour until the resolution of DKA.[32] Similarly, insulin aspart has been used and found to be similar in efficacy.[33] Patients with DKA should be treated with insulin until resolution. Criteria for resolution of ketoacidosis include blood glucose less than 200 mg/dl and two of the following criteria: a serum bicarbonate level >=more than 15 mEq/l, a venous pH more than 7.3, or a calculated anion gap equal or less than 12 mEq/l. Patients can be transitioned to subcutaneously administered insulin when DKA has resolved, and they are able to eat. Those previously treated with
