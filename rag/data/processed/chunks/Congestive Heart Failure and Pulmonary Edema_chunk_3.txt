gradual worsening of chronic symptoms that necessitate intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure exacerbation that requires hospitalization tends to occur in the older adult population, with a mean age of 79 years and a slightly higher preponderance of women affected than men.[1][2][3] Data from the United Kingdon National Heart Failure Audit show mortality rates of approximately 10% during the index admission, 30-day postdischarge mortality of 6.5%, and 1-year mortality of 30%.[3] ## Pathophysiology Heart failure can arise from various cardiovascular or metabolic abnormalities. Still, in most cases, clinical symptoms are due to left ventricular dysfunction and may be preserved or reduced when left ventricular dysfunction is present. The ejection fraction is a key measure often used to select patients for clinical trials and guide therapeutic decisions. In contrast, pulmonary edema seen in acute decompensated heart failure results from the dysregulation of pulmonary fluid homeostasis, disrupting the balance of forces controlling fluid movement into the alveolar space.[4][6] ## History and Physical Heart failure is predominately a clinical diagnosis. The presentation of heart failure may vary based on each patient; therefore, it is essential to consider the following during the history and physical: - **History:** If the patient has a history of past heart failure, ask if this is the same presentation as when they had previous episodes of heart failure or an acute decompensation. - **Symptom Causes:** Consider noncardiac and other causes of the patient's symptoms, as it is important to ensure a broad differential diagnosis and avoid anchoring bias, premature closer, and diagnostic inertia. - **Heart failure symptoms:** - Increasing dyspnea (on exertion, on lying flat or at rest, exercise intolerance) - Increasing leg swelling, ascites, edema - Increased body weight - Palpitations, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (associated with worse prognosis) - Chest pain, fatigue - Duration of Illness, recent or frequent hospitalizations for heart failure - Medications or diet changes - Anorexia, cachexia, or early satiety (associated with worse prognosis) - Symptoms of transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism (indicate a possible need for anticoagulation) - Social history and family history (to assess for possible familial cardiomyopathy, alcohol, or other cause - Travel history (exposure risk to some tropical diseases)\*\*\*\*[1][6] **Physical Examination** The physical examination should include the following: - **Vital signs:** Assess blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are important in helping develop and refine the differential diagnosis and help the healthcare professional tailor
