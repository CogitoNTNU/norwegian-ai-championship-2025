trauma results from road traffic accidents.[21] These are reported to be the highest in Africa and Southeast Asia.[17] In high-income nations, most TBI cases occur related to falls secondary to age-related frailty and alcohol misuse.[21] This group encompasses a considerable portion of the global injury burden.[22] The Global Burden of Disease study reported a worldwide age-standardized head trauma incidence of 346 per 100,000 people in 2019. In 2016, it was estimated that TBI resulted in 8.1 million years lived with disability and a pooled age-standardized rate of about 160 years of life lost per 100,000 people.[21] ## Pathophysiology Traumatic brain injury following head trauma results from primary and secondary injury/insults. **Primary Injury** Primary injury includes injury upon the initial impact that causes displacement of the brain due to direct impact, rapid acceleration-deceleration, or penetration. These injuries may cause skull fractures, cerebral contusions, hematomas (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid), and diffuse axonal injury (DAI). **Secondary Injury** A secondary neurotoxic cascade occurs after the initial insult and is most commonly secondary to hypoxia, hypotension, and raised intracranial pressure. Neuropathogenesis implicated in secondary injury in head trauma include: - Wallerian degeneration - Mitochondrial dysfunction - Glutamate hyper-excitotoxicity [23] - Lactate storm - Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation - Apoptotic cell death - Neuroinflammation - Impaired autophagy - Impaired G-lymphatic pathways [24][25] The glutamate hyper-excitotoxicity pathway describes when injured nerve cells secrete intracellular glutamate into the extracellular spaces. This then overstimulates a subtype glutamate receptor, allowing sodium and calcium influx into the injured nerve cell. This influx of ions activates various enzymes, which then degrade cell membranes and structure, leading to free radicals, cell death, and edema.[23] According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) are the prime buffers against any extra volume increment inside the rigid skull.[26] Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) may be estimated by measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) and the mean arterial pressure (MAP), CPP=MAP-ICP. ICP is a function of the relative amounts of CBV, brain parenchyma, and CSF in the inelastic space of the cranium. When raised, ICP overrides the compensatory displacement of the CSF and disrupts the cerebral autoregulatory capacity, leading to decreased brain compliance and a fall in compensatory reserve. This triggers sequential cascades of herniation syndrome, each showing salient neurological and radiological characteristics.[27] Subfalcine herniation leads to contralateral lower limb weakness due to pericallosal and callosomarginal vessel compression. Uncal herniation causes ipsilateral
