its early stages, where treatment may be more effective in slowing the progression of the disease.[43] **Baseline Assessment and Monitoring** PFTs are recommended every 3 to 6 months, which should be performed based on symptoms and the disease's progression. However, serial chest imaging may not always be necessary. Various tools, such as the GAP (gender, age, and physiology) score, assign points based on gender, age, FVC, and diffusing capacity or transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide to assess long-term prognosis. A higher GAP score indicates worse mortality. This scoring system is particularly valuable when evaluating patients for lung transplant referrals.[44][45][46] Additionally, objective assessment of functional status and screening for hypoxic respiratory failure is essential. The 6-minute walk test is commonly used in ILD specialty centers to achieve these goals.[47] **Supportive Treatments** Recommended supportive measures include tobacco cessation, oxygen supplementation, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Although supplemental oxygen is commonly advised for severe ILD cases, such as IPF, limited data exist that can guide its use in this patient population. Studies evaluating supplemental oxygen in ILD patients experiencing exertional hypoxemia are lacking.[48] Research on stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with mild resting hypoxemia or moderate exercise-induced hypoxemia showed no significant impact of supplemental oxygen on functional capacity, quality of life, need for hospitalization, or mortality.[49] Numerous studies have demonstrated the advantages of pulmonary rehabilitation for individuals with ILD, including IPF. A Cochrane review assessing the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation for ILD revealed that although pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in improvements in individuals with ILD, the quality of evidence was deemed low-to-moderate due to concerns regarding study methodology.[50] In a specific study, patients with IPF showed similar completion rates and response levels to pulmonary rehabilitation compared to those with COPD patients who were carefully matched.[51] Additionally, noncompletion and nonresponse to pulmonary rehabilitation in IPF patients were connected to increased mortality from all causes. The use of antacid medication and other interventions may offer benefits to patients experiencing symptoms of GERD alongside IPF.[39] Although current evidence does not advocate for using antacid medication and antireflux surgery as treatments for IPF, they may still be beneficial for managing GERD symptoms in these individuals.[39] Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination are recommended for individuals with IPF.[52] Previously, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, and _N_ -acetyl cysteine were utilized, but the current recommendation advises against their use in IPF due to findings from the PANTHER-IPF trial.[53] **Antifibrotic
