the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) determine therapy based on the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, the degree of respiratory impairment, and the risk of future exacerbations. Risk factors contributing to future exacerbations include frequent asthma symptoms, a history of intensive care unit admission for asthma, obesity, poor medication adherence, chronic rhinosinusitis, and a low FEV1. The severity categories and treatment guidelines vary based on age. This activity will address asthma severity and management in adolescents and adults aged 12 or older. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Pediatric Asthma](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/26821)," for additional information regarding the treatment of asthma in infants and children. Every patient should have access to a bronchodilator with a rapid onset of action. Traditionally, this has been a short-acting β-agonist (SABA) such as albuterol. However, GINA recommends a low-dose glucocorticoid/formoterol inhaler, such as 80 to 160 mcg budesonide/4.5 mcg formoterol inhaled by mouth 1 or 2 times daily, for asthma symptoms. Notably, this is an off-label indication for this preparation. Treatment progresses in a stepwise manner, with the highest severity category in which the patient experiences any symptoms, designating the treatment category from which the patient receives treatment (see **Image.** Asthma Severity Classification by National Asthma Education and Prevention Program). **Tables 1** and**2** below include the NAEPP and GINA asthma severity classifications and treatment initiation guidelines based on the patient's symptoms and lung function.

Routine follow-up every 1 to 6 months is necessary to ensure adequate symptom management. Upon reevaluation, patients facing inadequate asthma symptom management, exacerbations necessitating systemic glucocorticoids, or those at high risk of exacerbation on their current therapy level should escalate to the next level of therapy. Therapy adjustments proceed incrementally until symptoms are adequately managed. After maintaining control for 3 to 6 months, clinicians may consider gradual therapy reduction following the stepwise protocols outlined by GINA or NAEPP guidelines. **Severe Asthma** Adults and adolescents with
