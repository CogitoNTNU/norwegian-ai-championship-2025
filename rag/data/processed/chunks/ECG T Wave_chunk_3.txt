the ventricular action potential. The repolarization (phase 3) is caused by the closing of these Ca channels and the opening of K channels. The potassium flows out of the cell due to its electrochemical gradient to restore the resting membrane potential near -88 to -90 mV. ## History and Physical As there are many causes of T-wave abnormalities, there are just as many potential presentations. A thorough history and physical and a rigorous medication review can provide essential information to suggest a specific diagnosis. For example, a history of prior episodes of chest pain with recent worsening in symptoms may indicate an ischemia component. A new or recently added medication such as digoxin may suggest possible drug intoxication.[10] The temporality of the presentation is another essential part of assessing the etiology of T-wave abnormalities. Acute onset of dyspnea with tachycardia after a recent surgery may suggest a pulmonary embolism. While the presentations above have clear-cut performance symptoms, it is important to remember that T-wave changes are often asymptomatic, as many causes of T-wave changes are non-pathological, such as normal variants or lead to misplacement. ## Evaluation An ECG is 1 aspect of a patient's clinical evaluation. Its assessment should always be integrated into a complete diagnostic workup. Metabolic panels and biomarkers of myocardial ischemia are needed in scenarios of suspected ischemia or electrolyte abnormalities. If cerebral T waves are seen, a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan is suggested to look for any acute bleeding or trauma to the central nervous system. If a pulmonary embolism is suspected, a CT angiography should be conducted. ## Treatment / Management Treatment options differ depending on the etiology of the T-wave changes. Some T-wave changes require no intervention. However, some causes of T-wave changes are associated with high morbidity and mortality without emergent intervention. **Ischemia and Infarction** If acute T waves are seen as indicative of ischemia in a coronary artery distribution, management should be focused on reperfusion and treatment of the acute coronary syndrome.[11] **Hyperkalemia** In severe hyperkalemia in the presence of peaked T-waves, calcium gluconate should be administered promptly to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmia. Mild hyperkalemia without T-wave abnormalities can be managed with polystyrene sulfonate, a potassium binder, insulin, which forces potassium intracellularly, or furosemide, which drives potassium out of the body through the urinary tract.[12] **Pulmonary Embolism** Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of T-wave changes.
