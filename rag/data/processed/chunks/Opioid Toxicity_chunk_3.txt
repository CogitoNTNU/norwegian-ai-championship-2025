and dysphoria. The δ-receptor likely contributes to pain control and mood modulation, but some suggest that μ agonism is necessary for the δ-receptor to function effectively in analgesia.[9][10] Causes of opioid overdose include substance abuse, unintentional and intentional overdose, and therapeutic drug error. The risk of opioid overdose increases in the following situations: - Taking escalating doses - Returning to use after cessation - Having severe medical and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, HIV infection, and lung or liver disease - Combining opioids with sedative medications - Being male - Being younger (20 to 40 years) - Being of White non-Hispanic race [11][12] More than 1.5 million emergency department visits are related to opioid analgesic use. Opioid overdose is a common cause of death. ## Epidemiology **Impact of the Opioid Crisis in the United States** Opiates are frequently prescribed for moderate to severe pain in the United States. These drugs may be prescribed alone or combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants. Based on data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders Systems, the percentage increases in opiate use from 2004 through 2011 were as follows: - Buprenorphine 2318% - Fentanyl 35% - Hydromorphone 140% - Methadone 37% - Morphine 64% - Oxycodone 117% Meanwhile, the use of codeine decreased by 20%. Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has revealed that abuse of all the above opiates increased, with hydromorphone and buprenorphine leading the way with a 438% and 384% increase, respectively. ([SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014.pdf), 2014) Other reports from DAWN reveal that nearly 420,000 documented emergency room visits in 2013 were related to opiates. Cases of abuse and diversion of opiates over the past decade have included drugs like hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. In 2015, United States poison control centers reported a total of 18,425 exposures to pure opiates, which resulted in 68 fatalities and 764 cases of major toxicity. Additionally, 14,632 cases involved exposure to combinations of opiates with alcohol, benzodiazepines, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. The combined exposures resulted in 32 fatalities and 288 cases of severe toxicity. ([AAPCC,](http://www.aapcc.org/press/81/) 2017) The opioid crisis was reported to claim about 128 lives per day in 2018.[13] **Global Consequences of the Opioid Epidemic** The opiate toxicity epidemic is not limited to the United States but is also a worldwide concern. According to the 2014 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, at least 0.4% of the population,
