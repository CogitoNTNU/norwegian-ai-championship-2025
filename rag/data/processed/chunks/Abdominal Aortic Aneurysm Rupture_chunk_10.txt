and initiate a rapid admission with direct communication to the emergency department clinician and the full interprofessional team about the patient. Once admitted, if stable, these patients require an urgent ultrasound; therefore, the radiologist should be notified. If the patient is unstable, the nurse should obtain vital signs, attach monitoring equipment, and assist with resuscitation if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Referral to a vascular center capable of providing a standard-of-care management is appropriate. Once the decision for repair has been made, conducting a cardiology workup, obtaining clearance, and optimizing other medical comorbidities can improve outcomes. If the aneurysm is small, the interprofessional team should educate the patient and family about the importance of blood pressure control, a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and follow-up appointment adherence. During postoperative care, the nurse must be familiar with potential complications of the surgery and notify the interprofessional team if the patient has abdominal or back pain, wound discharge, fever, oliguria, or hypotension. The nurse should also ensure the patient has prophylaxis to prevent deep vein thrombosis. The respiratory therapist should encourage deep breathing and coughing, and the physical therapist should encourage ambulation. The nurse should also auscultate for bowel sounds and convey the results to the interprofessional team to initiate feeding. Before discharge, the pharmacist and nurse should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance, blood pressure control, and tobacco avoidance. The nurse should also ensure that the appropriate consulting clinician, dietitian, or social workers have spoken to the patient and that the surgeon has been notified before discharge. Open communication among the interprofessional team is vital to ensure good outcomes. **Outcomes** For elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the outcomes are good, with minimal morbidity. However, if a rupture has occurred, the mortality rates can exceed 50%. Current guidelines suggest that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo surgery in hospitals with an interprofessional team approach to manage this pathology. To improve outcomes, it is imperative that patients stop smoking, maintain a healthy body weight, control their blood pressure, and remain compliant with medications. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17011&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17011) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17011) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17011/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17011) [![Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration](/books/NBK470237/bin/Aortadiagramgray.gif)](/books/NBK470237/figure/article-17011.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470237/figure/article-17011.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration.
