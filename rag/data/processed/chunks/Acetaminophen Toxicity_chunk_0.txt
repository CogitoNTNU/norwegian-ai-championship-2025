Numerous diseases and conditions include pain as a significant component of their presentation. Consequently, effective pain management holds great importance for both clinicians and patients. Clinicians can use acetaminophen for their patients as a single agent for mild-to-moderate pain or in conjunction with an opioid analgesic for severe pain. This activity outlines the utilization, indications, administration, contraindications, and toxicity of acetaminophen, emphasizing the integral role of the interprofessional healthcare team in the care of patients using acetaminophen. **Objectives:** - Identify appropriate scenarios for acetaminophen use by distinguishing between mild-to-moderate and severe pain and assessing the patient's overall health status. - Assess patients for pain relief effectiveness by monitoring for any signs of adverse effects or toxicity related to acetaminophen. - Select appropriate acetaminophen formulations and routes of administration based on patient needs, considering factors such as age, weight, and ability to swallow. - Collaborate with other interprofessional healthcare team members to ensure comprehensive pain management and improve patient outcomes by incorporating acetaminophen appropriately into multimodal treatment plans.

Numerous diseases and conditions include pain as a significant component of their presentation. Consequently, effective pain management holds great importance for both clinicians and patients. Clinicians can use acetaminophen for their patients as a single agent for mild-to-moderate pain or in conjunction with an opioid analgesic for severe pain.[1] ## Mechanism of Action Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic medications.[2] Although the exact mechanism of action of the drug remains unclear, it is historically categorized along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to its inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[3][4] Acetaminophen possesses analgesic and antipyretic properties similar to NSAIDs but lacks peripheral
