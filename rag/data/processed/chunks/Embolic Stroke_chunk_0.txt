Up to two-thirds of strokes are ischemic in origin, and approximately 25 percent of all ischemic strokes are cardioembolic. Cardioembolic strokes are frequently more severe than atherothrombotic strokes. Additionally, they are more prone to both early and late recurrences. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of cardioembolic strokes and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for affected patients. **Objectives:** - Describe the etiology of cardioembolic stroke. - Explain the evaluation of a cardioembolic stroke. - Review the treatment options for cardioembolic strokes. - Summarize the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by cardioembolic strokes.

Strokes may well represent the flagship of these non-communicable diseases. That said, it is worth mentioning that the heavy burden of stroke continues to be in low-to-middle-income countries.[1] An estimated 26 million people suffer from a stroke every year, making it one of the most significant contributors to both mortality and long-term disability. Up to two-thirds of these are ischemic.[1] Approximately 25% of all ischemic cases are believed to be cardioembolic in origin.[2] However, despite accounting for a relatively small proportion of all ischemic strokes, cardioembolic strokes are particularly important as they are frequently more severe than atherothrombotic strokes. Additionally, they are more prone to both early and late recurrences.[3] Cardioembolic strokes can occur from at least a dozen specific cardiac disorders, including atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombi, cardiac tumors, valvular vegetations, and paradoxical emboli. For the most part, cardioembolic strokes can be prevented. ## Etiology Cardioembolic strokes can occur as a consequence of any cardiac insult that could cause the fulfillment of Virchow triad of endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. Commonly encountered causes include: - Atrial disease: - Arrhythmias: -
