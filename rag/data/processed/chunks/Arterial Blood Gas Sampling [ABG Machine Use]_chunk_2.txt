manufacturing can create significant differences in pre-analytical effects on the sample.[15] The anaerobic collection technique means no blood exposure to atmospheric air.[16] The PCO2 of air is approximately 0.25 mm Hg, much less than that of blood (40 mm Hg). Thus, the CO2 content and PCO2 of blood exposed to air will decrease, and blood pH, a function of PCO2, will rise. The PO2 of atmospheric air (155 mm Hg) is approximately 60 mm Hg higher than that of arterial blood and approximately 100 mm Hg higher than venous blood. Hence, blood exposed to atmospheric air in a patientâ€™s breathing room absorbs oxygen, while blood with a PO2 exceeding 150 mm Hg, a condition observed in patients undergoing oxygen therapy, releases oxygen.[17] Blood exposure to air can occur simply from the air in the needle and the syringe hub dead space. The error will be minimal if the resulting bubble is ejected immediately after drawing by holding the syringe tip up and ejecting a small drop of blood.[18] The potential effect of small bubbles on blood gas results was demonstrated in one study in which a 100-mL bubble of room air was added to 10, 2-mL blood samples with PO2 values between 25 and 40 mm Hg. PO2 increased an average of 4 mm Hg in these samples in only 2 minutes, whereas PCO2 decreased by 4 mm Hg. Before analysis, mixing the sample by vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms should be done to establish a homogeneous sample.[19] Arterialized capillary blood is sometimes an acceptable alternative to arterial blood when an arterial cannula is unavailable or repeated arterial punctures must be avoided.[20] Automated blood gas analyzers are commonly used to analyze blood gas samples, and results are obtained within 10 to 15 minutes. Automated blood gas analyzers, directly and indirectly, measure specific components of the arterial blood gas sample (see above).[1] ABG components include the following: - pH = _measured_ acid-base balance of the blood - PaO2 = _measured the_ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood - PaCO2 =_measured_ the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood - HCO3 = _calculated_ concentration of bicarbonate in arterial blood - Base excess/deficit = _calculated_ relative excess or deficit of base in arterial blood - SaO2 =_calculated_ arterial oxygen saturation (unless a co-oximetry is obtained, in which case it is _measured)_ A modified Allen test is necessary before an
