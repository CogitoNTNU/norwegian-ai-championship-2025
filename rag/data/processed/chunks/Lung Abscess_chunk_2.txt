bacteria (eg, _Bacteroides_ , _Prevotella_ , _Peptostreptococcus_ , _Fusobacterium_ , or streptococci).[3] A monomicrobial lung abscess is typically caused by streptococci, _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Streptococcus pyogenes_ , _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ , _Hemophilus influenzae_ type b, _Nocardia_ , or _Actinomyces_.[4][5] In patients with alcohol use disorder, the most common underlying organisms of a lung abscess include _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Streptococcus pyogenes_ , and _Actinomyces_. Poor dental hygiene is an independent risk factor for the development of lung abscesses.[6] The incidence of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ complex infection is greater in lung transplant recipients than in other solid organ transplant recipients. This increased incidence is primarily because lung transplant recipients need higher levels of immunosuppression posttransplant than other solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, lung transplant recipients possess numerous donor-derived dendritic cells capable of activating T-cells and may encounter environmental antigens that could lead to graft rejection.[7] ## Epidemiology Some of the most common factors that predispose a patient to develop a lung abscess include: - Immunocompromised patients (eg, HIV-AIDS, posttransplantation, or those receiving prolonged immune suppressive therapy) [7][8] - Patients at high risk for aspiration (eg, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, alcohol intoxication, and cognitive impairment) [9] ## Pathophysiology In most cases, patients have primary lung abscesses due to aspiration of oropharyngeal contents with anaerobes. These primary lung abscesses typically initially start as aspiration pneumonia and are later complicated by pneumonitis, progressing to tissue necrosis in 1 to 2 weeks if left untreated.[9] Bronchogenic causes include bronchial obstruction by a tumor, foreign body, enlarged lymph nodes, aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, and congenital malformation. In remaining cases, a lung abscess results from the hematogenous spread of an extrapulmonary pathology, including abdominal sepsis, infective endocarditis, and septic thromboembolism. ## Histopathology Acute lung abscesses are typically characterized by poorly defined borders within the lung parenchyma and are filled with thick necrotic debris. Histologically, the central region of an acute abscess contains necrotic tissue intermingled with necrotic granulocytes and bacteria. Surrounding this central area are intact neutrophilic granulocytes, dilated blood vessels, and inflammatory edema (**Image.** Acute Lung Abscess). In contrast, chronic lung abscesses often have an irregular, star-like shape with well-defined borders in the lung parenchyma. These abscesses contain a grayish lining or thick debris. The center of a chronic abscess is filled with pus, with or without bacteria. Surrounding the abscess is a pyogenic membrane through which white blood cells migrate into the abscess
