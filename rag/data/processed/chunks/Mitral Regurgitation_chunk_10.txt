due to the concave design of its paddles, which may complicate the precise alignment of 2 implants. For isolated commissural lesions, the preference should be for implants with smaller arms (NTW/NT) and dependable steering capabilities.[57] Conducting a thorough assessment of the length and thickness of the leaflet tissue is essential. When annular calcifications with leaflet infiltration are identified as predictors of a higher transmitral gradient after TEER, opting for smaller, more flexible devices is advisable.[26][58] In cases of secondary MR involving a short or thin tethered posterior leaflet, it is advisable to avoid devices with extended arms, like the MitraClip XT and XTW, to minimize the risk of single leaflet device attachment or leaflet injury. The PASCAL devices, with their flexible nitinol construction and horizontal positioning of the gripping components, are often preferred, especially when dealing with a short posterior leaflet, as they apply gripping force at the leaflet base, often referred to as the "hinge point" with the mitral annulus.[54] ## Technique or Treatment **The Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair Device** The structural heart team comprises an interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, cardiac anesthesiologist, and operating room nurse who is required to perform the transcatheter mitral valve repair with the edge-to-edge leaflet repair device. Procedural rooms are specialized with fluoroscopic capability. The procedure involves using fluoroscopic and TEE guidance to image the heart before, during, and after the procedure.[59] The patient will be under general anesthesia for ease and comfort and to avoid patient movement during the procedure. The following table demonstrates the procedure's major steps; the TEE views to guide those steps, and potential complications with each step (see **Table 7.** Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair Procedure Overview). **Table 7.** Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair\*\*\*\* Procedure Overview [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table6/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table6/?report=objectonly) Preprocedure: Cardiac assessment and evaluation of MV by TEE [60] The valvular pathology must be confirmed IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; RA, right atrium; IAS, interatrial septum; SVC, superior vena cava; ACT, activated clotting time; SGC, steerable guide catheter; ASD, atrial septal defect; PACU, post-anesthesia care unit; ICU, intensive care unit; MV, mitral valve; IAS, iatrogenic atrial septa; TEER, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair; MR, mitral regurgitation; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography ## Complications Despite the significant comorbidities among the patients being treated, TEER is a safe operation with a low likelihood of major consequences. The table below summarizes the most common complications and their relative occurrence rates (see **Table
