in this patient population. However, norepinephrine should be used with caution as it can cause tachycardia and increased myocardial oxygen demand in patients with recent myocardial infarctions. - Dobutamine is widely used, has beta-1 and beta-2 agonist properties, which can improve myocardial contractility, lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and increased cardiac output. - Milrinone, also a widely used inotrope, has been shown to reduce left ventricular filling pressures. - Saline or lactated ringer solution greater than 200 ml per 15 to 30 minutes is indicated in patients with no signs of fluid overload. - Fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to patients who are unsuitable candidates for either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft if there are no contraindications. - Patients with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome are given aspirin and heparin. They have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality. - Diuretics such as furosemide play a role in decreasing plasma volume and edema and thereby decreasing cardiac output and blood pressure. This is associated with a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance. With continuous therapy, extracellular fluid and plasma volumes return almost to pretreatment levels. - Therapeutic hypothermia is established for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with shockable rhythm to prevent brain injury and improve survival. **Procedures** - Central line placement plays a role in fluid resuscitation, access for multiple infusions, and allows invasive monitoring of central venous pressure. - Arterial line placement is useful in providing continuous blood pressure monitoring, especially in patients requiring inotropic agents. - Mechanical ventilation is indicated in patients with cardiogenic shock for oxygenation and airway protection. **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Coronary Artery Bypass** - Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be performed, irrespective of time delay from the onset of myocardial infarction - Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting is indicated in patients with coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI. SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial data confirmed an approach that combines early revascularization with medical management in patients with cardiogenic shock is optimal. **Mechanical Circulatory Support** Due to the poor prognosis associated with cardiogenic shock, medical therapy is often inadequate, and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy to improve end-organ perfusion may be required. An experienced interprofessional team should evaluate MCS. - Percutaneous circulatory assist devices provide superior hemodynamic support compared with pharmacologic therapy. - Intra-aortic balloon pumps can be considered but are less likely to
