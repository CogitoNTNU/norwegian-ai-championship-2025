a lung abscess include: - Excavating bronchial carcinoma (squamocellular or microcellular) - Excavating tuberculosis - Localized pleural empyema - Infected emphysematous bullae - Cavitary pneumoconiosis - Hiatal hernia - Pulmonary hematoma - Hydatid cyst of the lung - Cavitary infarcts of lung - Polyangiitis with granulomatosis (Wegener granulomatosis) - Foreign body aspiration - Septic pulmonary emboli ## Prognosis In most cases, empiric antibiotic therapy successfully treats primary lung abscesses, followed by targeted therapy depending on gram stain and culture results, with an approximately 90% cure rate. Secondary abscesses require treatment of the underlying cause to improve the outcome. The prognosis of patients with secondary lung abscesses is poor, especially in immunocompromised patients and patients with bronchial neoplasm, with a mortality rate of approximately 75%.[21] ## Complications Complications primarily develop secondary to the underrecognition or inappropriate treatment of a lung abscess's underlying etiology. Complications include abscess rupture into the pleural space, pleural fibrosis, trapped lung, respiratory failure, bronchopleural fistula, and pleurocutaneous fistula.[22] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patient and caregiver education regarding the mitigation of aspiration risk factors through strategies including avoiding excessive alcohol intake, proper dental care, and elevation of the head of the bed is essential to preventing the development of a lung abscess. Clinicians should also educate patients and their families about prompt recognition of lung abscess symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and productive or nonproductive coughs. Antibiotic therapy compliance and monitoring for adverse effects of medications should be emphasized to avoid complications. ## Pearls and Other Issues The following key underlying etiologies should be kept in mind when managing a lung abscess: **Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions** - Dental and periodontal infection - Paranasal sinusitis - Altered level of consciousness - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Frequent vomiting - Intubated patients - Patients with tracheostomy - Vocal cord paralysis - Alcohol use disorder - Cerebrovascular accident **Hematogenic dissemination** - Abdominal sepsis - Infective endocarditis - Intravenous drug abuse - Infected cannula or central venous catheter - Septic thromboembolisms **Coexisting lung diseases** - Bronchiectasis - Cystic fibrosis - Bullous emphysema - Bronchial obstruction by a tumor, foreign body, or enlarged lymph nodes - Congenital malformations - Infected pulmonary infarcts - Pulmonary contusion - Bronchoesophageal fistula ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of lung abscesses requires a coordinated interprofessional approach involving physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals to enhance patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team
