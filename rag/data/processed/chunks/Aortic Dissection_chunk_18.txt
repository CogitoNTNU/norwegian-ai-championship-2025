This image, showing the exact dissection, is produced using a hematoxylin-eosin stain and is magnified to 4× power. In this case, the dissection occurred in the outer one-third of the aortic media.

In this case, the aortic dissection occurred in the lamina media, and there is histologic evidence of blood flow through the false lumen, as there are small thrombotic residues inside the false lumen.
