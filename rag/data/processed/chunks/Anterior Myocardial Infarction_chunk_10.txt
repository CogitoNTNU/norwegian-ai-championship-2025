time of fewer than 120 minutes, aiming for prompt reperfusion to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery. - If the door-in-door-out time is greater than 30 minutes, and the first medical contact to intervention time is greater than 120 minutes, a fibrinolytic agent should be administered within 30 minutes of arrival. Evidence of failed reperfusion will require urgent transfer to a PCI-capable hospital. - Patients with STEMI who meet the criteria should undergo emergent PCI as the preferred reperfusion strategy. Indications for emergent PCI are as follows: ischemic symptoms for less than 12 hours, absolute contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy regardless of time delay from the first medical contact, cardiogenic shock, or acute severe heart failure. - Early reperfusion leads to decreased complications and a better prognosis. PCI has demonstrated superiority to thrombolytic therapy in reducing short-term and long-term adverse cardiac events in patients with anterior acute MI.[24][25] - Routine thrombectomy before PCI is not recommended. PCI of the non-infarct related artery may be considered in stable patients during primary PCI or as a staged procedure.[26] **Treatment at a non-PCI capable facility with a delay of more than 120 minutes from** **FMC to primary PCI:** Thrombolytic therapy should be given if the onset of symptoms is less than 12 hours (class I) or the onset of symptoms is 12 to 24 hours, but there is clinical evidence of ongoing ischemia with potential for large myocardium damage or hemodynamic instability. If a patient develops cardiogenic shock or has refractory heart failure after receiving thrombolytic therapy, they should be transferred for immediate angiography and possible PCI. A patient may also require transfer for immediate angiography and possible PCI if there is evidence of failed reperfusion or re-occlusion of the infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy. For stable patients who have received successful thrombolysis, elective PCI can be considered between 3 and 24 hours after thrombolysis to assess further and treat the coronary artery. **Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy for** **patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy** : 1. **Aspirin** : - Loading dose: 162 to 325 mg - Maintenance dose: 81 to 325 mg maintenance dose 1. **Clopidogrel** : - Loading dose for age \<75: 300 mg loading dose - Maintenance dose for age \<75: 75 mg maintenance. - Loading dose for age >75: no loading dose - Maintenance dose for age>75: 75 mg daily for 14 days and up to 1 year 1. **Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)**
