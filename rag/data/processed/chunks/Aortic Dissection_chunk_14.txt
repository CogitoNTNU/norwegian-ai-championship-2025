generally better in high-volume centers, which handle more than 5 aortic dissection cases per year, compared to smaller centers that perform fewer procedures.[23][24][25] Despite advances in surgical and endovascular techniques that have improved survival rates, the quality of life and functional status of survivors can be compromised. Persistent pain, reduced exercise capacity, and psychological effects such as anxiety and depression are common among patients who have experienced an aortic dissection. Long-term management includes lifestyle modifications, stringent blood pressure control, and regular follow-up with imaging to detect complications early and prevent disease progression. Overall, the prognosis of aortic dissection is largely influenced by early recognition, timely intervention, and diligent long-term monitoring. Comprehensive multidisciplinary care and patient adherence to treatment plans are essential to improving survival and reducing morbidity in this high-risk population. ## Complications Common complications of aortic dissection include: - Multiorgan failure - Stroke - Myocardial infarction - Paraplegia - Renal failure - Amputation of extremities - Bowel ischemia - Tamponade - Acute aortic regurgitation - Compression of superior vena cava - Death Endoleak is another common and significant complication in about 25% of patients after graft placement. An endoleak is the leakage of blood into an excluded aneurysmal sac, a term introduced by White et al. This complication can lead to aneurysm rupture over time, highlighting the need for regular imaging follow-ups for all patients after EVAR, as endoleaks may develop at any point.[26] CTA is the preferred imaging method for ongoing monitoring after EVAR. Endoleaks are categorized into 5 types, with the classification based on the source of the blood flow, which has a critical impact on subsequent patient management (see **Image.** Endoleak Types).[27] The type and location of endoleaks determine the management plan. Endoleaks are classified as: - Type I - Leakage at the attachment sites due to insufficient sealing - IA: Proximal attachment leak - IB: Distal attachment leak - IC: Occurs with an aorto-mono-iliac graft and femoro-femoral bypass from the contralateral nongrafted iliac artery - Type II - Leakage through collateral vessels, such as the lumbar, inferior mesenteric, or internal iliac arteries - Type III - Leakage resulting from defects in the graft, including fractures or holes (mechanical failure of the graft) - Type IV - Leakage with no apparent source, attributed to graft porosity - Type V - Aneurysm expansion without visible leakage (endotension) ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care **Postoperative and Long-Term Management** After
