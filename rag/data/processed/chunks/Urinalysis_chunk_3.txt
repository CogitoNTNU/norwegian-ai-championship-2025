stone risk based on laboratory data. Typically, 24-hour urine tests for nephrolithiasis evaluation include measurements of urinary volume, pH, calcium, citrate, magnesium, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate, and uric acid. Supersaturation ratios for different stone types can then be calculated. In patients with a history of cystine stones or a positive cystine cyanide test, 24-hour cystine levels can also be assessed.[14][15] Finding or selecting a laboratory to process 24-hour urine chemistries can be challenging. Ideally, all tests should be completed at a single laboratory, and the results should be presented clearly, including both 24-hour totals and relative concentrations. While normal values provide a baseline, they may not represent "optimal" values for patients with nephrolithiasis. Therefore, normal urinary chemistry reference values for each lab should be reported alongside the results. ## Testing Procedures The primary techniques for evaluating serum, plasma, and urine creatinine levels include enzymatic assays, colorimetric assays using alkaline picrate, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Colorimetric and enzymatic assays are also commonly used to measure urea concentration. Most of these methods use urease and a coupled enzyme that utilizes ammonia as a substrate.[16] Proteins are usually measured using mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography. Less commonly, antibodies or deoxyribonucleic aptamers are used to bind specific proteins. Detecting posttranslational modifications can be more challenging; methods such as colorimetric assays, radioactive isotope-labeled substrates, Western blotting with protein-specific antibodies, and peptide and protein arrays are also used.[17] Plasma and urine metanephrines are metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Metanephrines are relatively stable compared to catecholamines and can be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 days without significant degradation. For testing delays longer than 3 days, storing samples at -20 °C or lower is recommended.[6] ## Interfering Factors The amount of creatinine produced daily depends on muscle mass. As CKD progresses, muscle mass tends to decline, which affects creatinine production. Therefore, creatinine reference ranges vary between sexes, with lower values typically seen in children and individuals with reduced muscle mass. Dietary factors also influence creatinine levels; for instance, consumption of red meat can alter creatinine by up to 30%. In addition, some patients, particularly young males, may use creatine supplements to increase muscle mass, so it is important to inquire directly about this.[18] During pregnancy, GFR increases, resulting in lower creatinine levels. This factor should be considered when interpreting creatinine measurements in pregnant women. One limitation of using creatinine formulas to estimate GFR is that
