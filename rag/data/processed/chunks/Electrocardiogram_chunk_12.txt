and there is often a reciprocal ST depression in leads III and aVF in lateral wall MI.[55] ST depressions are also associated with non-ischemic causes, including digoxin toxicity, hypokalemia, hypothermia, and tachycardia.[56] **QT Interval** It represents the start of depolarization to the end of the repolarization of ventricles. The normal QT interval duration is somewhat controversial, and various normal durations have been previously suggested. Generally, the normal QT interval is less than 400 to 440 milliseconds (ms), or 0.4 to 0.44 seconds. Women usually have a slightly longer QT interval than men. A QT interval has an inverse relation to the heart rate. A prolonged QT interval presents an imminent risk for serious ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. A common cause of QT prolongation includes medications, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, and congenital long QT syndrome.[57] A short QT interval ( less than 360 milliseconds) may be associated with hypercalcemia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, or short QT syndrome.[58] **U Wave** It is a small wave that follows the T wave. It represents the delayed repolarization of the papillary muscles or Purkinje fibers. It is commonly associated with hypokalemia. **J Wave** Also known as the Osborn wave, it is an abnormal ECG finding in hypothermia. It appears as an extra deflection on ECG at the QRS complex and ST-segment junction.[59] **Epsilon Wave** It is a small positive deflection usually found buried at the end of the QRS complex as a characteristic finding in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.[60] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The use of an electrocardiogram has expanded from simple heart rate and essential rhythm monitoring to interpreting complex arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and other ECG abnormalities. The rapid detection of myocardial infarction has substantially reduced the door-to-balloon time for reperfusion therapy. Nurses' skills regarding assessment and comprehensive knowledge of the dysrhythmias can prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation and improve patient outcomes from the emergency department presentation through discharge and follow-up.[61] Cardiology board-certified pharmacists can make appropriate medication recommendations for several medications, particularly antiarrhythmics, based on ECG readings and patient history, working in conjunction with the cardiologist. ECG outcomes in management are noticeable in every department within the interprofessional healthcare team. Interaction among clinicians (MDs and DOs, including specialists, NPS, and PAs), nurses, patient care assistants, pharmacists, and ECG technicians is critical to providing the most effective patient care.
