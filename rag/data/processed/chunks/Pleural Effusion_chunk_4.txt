indicates the presence of a significant amount of pleural fluid, typically exceeding 200 mL and blunting the costophrenic angle (see **Image.** Right Lung Pleural Effusion Radiograph, Posteroanterior). In lesser quantities of pleural effusion, blunting of the costophrenic angles on posteroanterior erect chest roentgenograms serves as a clue to elicit further investigations. However, a lateral decubitus view can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid in the pleural space (see **Image.** Pleural Effusion Radiograph, Lateral Decubitus).[[15]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13089-023-00356-z) Ultrasound is more sensitive and is readily available for diagnosing and confirming an effusion and planning a thoracentesis.[[7]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=165654#ref_30272503)[[8]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=165654#ref_29916720)[14] All initial effusion occurrences warrant a thoracentesis to ascertain the underlying etiology of the condition, except in instances where heart failure is confidently suspected. In such cases, a trial of diuresis may be conducted as a preliminary measure. Incorporating thoracic ultrasound in management planning is crucial. This test's prompt availability and rapid performance reduce the need for ancillary diagnostic testing such as computed tomography (CT) and offer valuable insights into fluid characteristics, which can aid in diagnosis (see **Image.** Bilateral Pleural Effusions on Chest Computed Tomography).[15] In addition, thoracic ultrasound assists in differentiating fluid accumulation from other conditions that present as radiopaque abnormalities on chest radiographs, such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Pleural fluid appears hypoechoic on ultrasound. The dependent chest area and surrounding anatomical structures must be examined for better visualization. Effusion echogenicity must be noted since features such as septations may indicate a complex effusion arising from conditions such as parapneumonic effusion or empyema. The hematocrit sign is characterized by smoke-like shadows, which may indicate the presence of a hemothorax. A complex-appearing fluid collection necessitates planning for chest tube thoracostomy (CTT). Blood tests should include a complete blood count with differential (a leukocytosis may indicate infection, bleeding, or malignancy), serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function tests and enzymes, albumin, lipase, and cardiac enzymes. Routinely assessed biomarkers after thoracentesis include fluid pH, fluid and serum protein levels, fluid and serum LDH levels, fluid glucose levels, fluid cell count differential, fluid gram stain, and culture. Fluid cytology may also be examined in specific situations. Light's criteria may then be applied to classify the fluid as an exudate or transudate. Light's criteria should be interpreted within the clinical context as it has been reported to misclassify 25% to 30% of transudates as exudates in heart failure-related pleural effusion. In such instances, obtaining a fluid B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
