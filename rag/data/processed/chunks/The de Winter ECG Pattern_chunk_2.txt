circulation causes the de Winter ECG pattern.[18][19] This latter hypothesis, however, does not fully explain reports of this presentation in patients without adequate collateral circulation.[8][16][14] Other proposed mechanisms include anatomical variants in the Purkinje fibers and myocardial metabolism downregulation.[8][11][17] A contemporary cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study by Zorzi et al highlighted the potential interplay of several mechanisms (eg, differential action potential expression and collateral circulation) resulting in the de Winter ECG pattern.[18] ## History and Physical Given that the de Winter ECG pattern is generally associated with an ACS, patients frequently will present with a medical history positive for heart disease risk factors, including a family or personal history of heart disease, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Clinical features are also consistent with ACS (eg, oppressive acute chest pain and shortness of breath).[2][5][16][11][19][4] Because the de Winter ECG pattern is often associated with a hyperacute stage of myocardial infarction (MI), physical examination can be unremarkable. However, some patients may present with diaphoresis and ongoing discomfort associated with acute symptomatology in the setting of ACS.[16][11][13][18][19] Findings on physical examination may also vary, as detailed by the Killip classification system, which was developed to guide the clinical assessment of patients with myocardial infarction.[2][20][2] - Killip class I: patients without any clinical sign of heart failure - Killip class II: patients with crackles or rales in the lungs, elevated jugular venous pressure, and an S3 gallop - Killip class III: patients with evident acute pulmonary edema - Killip class IV: patients with cardiogenic shock or hypotension (ie, a systolic blood pressure \<90 mm Hg) and signs of low cardiac output (eg, oliguria, cyanosis, or impaired mental status) ## Evaluation The de Winter ECG pattern, as proposed in the seminal article by De Winter et al, consists of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall and peaked positive T waves.[8] Additionally, most individuals present with a 1 to 2 mm ST-segment elevation in lead aVR.[8] Other possible findings include loss of R wave progression in the precordial leads and QRS complexes of normal duration or only slightly widened.[8] (see **Image.** The de Winter ECG pattern) However, strict criteria defining the de Winter ECG pattern remain elusive, as elegantly reported in a systematic review by Morris et al which showed differences in categorization among studies.[9][10] In this review, upsloping depression of the ST-segment
