"[Central Sleep Apnea](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/141286)" and "[Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30790)," for more information. ## Etiology Pharyngeal narrowing and closure during sleep is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. Sleep-related reductions in ventilatory drive, neuromuscular factors, and anatomical risk factors all contribute significantly to upper airway obstruction during sleep.[1] Anatomical factors that promote pharyngeal narrowing include a large neck circumference, excess soft tissue, bony structures, or blood vessels.[6] Many of these structures can increase pressure around the upper airway, leading to pharyngeal collapsibility and insufficient space for airflow in part of the upper airway during sleep.[7] In addition, the upper airway muscle tone is crucial; when muscle tone decreases, it leads to a repetitive total or partial airway collapse. OSA in adults is most commonly associated with obesity, male sex, and advancing age.[8] **Anatomical Factors** - Micrognathia and retrognathia - Facial elongation - Mandibular hypoplasia - Adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy - Inferior displacement of the hyoid **Nonanatomical Risk Factors** - Central fat distribution - Obesity - Advanced age - Male gender - Supine sleeping position - Pregnancy [9] **Additional Factors** - Alcohol use - Smoking - Use of sedatives and hypnotics **Associated Medical Disorders** - Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, acromegaly, and hypothyroidism) [10][11] - Neurological disorders (eg, stroke, spinal cord injury, and myasthenia gravis) [12][13] - Prader-Willi syndrome [14] - Down Syndrome [15] - Congestive heart failure [16] - Atrial fibrillation [17] - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome These associations between OSA and various medical disorders are primarily based on observational studies rather than randomized clinical trials. ## Epidemiology OSA is a common condition with significant adverse consequences.[18] Using the definition of 5 or more events per hour, OSA affects almost 1 billion people globally,[19]\*\*\*\* with 425 million adults aged between 30 to 69 having moderate-to-severe OSA (15 or more events per hour).[20]\*\*\*\* In the United States, it has been reported that 25% to 30% of men and 9% to 17% of women meet the criteria for OSA.[21][22] Prevalence is higher in Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations. Prevalence also increases with age, and when individuals are 50 years or older, and as many women as men develop the disorder. The increasing prevalence of OSA is related to the rising rates of obesity, ranging between 14% and 55%.[21] Some risk factors, including obesity and upper airway soft tissue structure, are genetically inherited.[23] ## Pathophysiology Upper airway obstruction during sleep is often caused
