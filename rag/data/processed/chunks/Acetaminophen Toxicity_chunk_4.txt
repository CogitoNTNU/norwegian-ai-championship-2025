reported instances of a rare pneumonia resulting from drug-induced lung injury due to acetaminophen.[15] **Drug-Drug Interactions** **Warfarin** : Prolonged oral administration of acetaminophen at 4000 mg/d has been associated with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin. Due to the lack of studies evaluating short-term acetaminophen use with oral anticoagulants, increased frequency of INR monitoring may be advisable in these situations. **Alcohol** : Chronic alcohol misuse increases the risk of acetaminophen toxicity by inducing CYP2E1, reducing hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, and impairing NAPQI detoxification. Moreover, it may decrease glucuronidation, enhance oxidation, cause hepatocyte membrane disruptions, and reduce biliary excretion.[16] ## Contraindications Contraindications to using acetaminophen include hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, severe hepatic impairment, or severe active hepatic disease.[14] **Box Warnings** **Hepatotoxicity:** Acetaminophen use has been associated with liver failure, occasionally resulting in liver transplants or fatalities. The hepatotoxicity observed with acetaminophen use usually corresponds to high doses that surpass the recommended maximum dose.[17][18] This effect may be associated with the consumption of multiple drug products containing acetaminophen as an ingredient. Liver damage has also been documented in patients with chronic acetaminophen dosing. **Dosing errors:** A notable FDA-box warning underscores the importance of preventing dosing errors, especially when administering acetaminophen to pediatric patients. In addition, it underscores the necessity of ensuring that the total daily dose of acetaminophen does not exceed the recommended maximum when accounting for all medications containing acetaminophen. Although these effects, warnings, and associations have been documented, acetaminophen remains a safe and effective medication when used accurately. The current manufacturer dose recommendation is restricted to between 3 and 3.25 g in 24 hours, depending on the formulation. However, toxicity is rare at doses less than 200 mg/kg for a child or 150 mg/kg for adults. ## Monitoring Patients undergoing acetaminophen treatment should undergo monitoring for desired clinical effects, such as pain or fever relief. Serum concentrations are unnecessary when appropriately dosed. In overdose situations, laboratory evaluation becomes necessary. In acute overdoses where ingestion occurs in less than 8 hours, a serum APAP concentration should be assessed and plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. The time course should start at the onset of ingestion to determine toxicity and the need for treatment. For nonacute ingestions, assessing acetaminophen concentration and transaminases is required, and treatment should be administered. Furthermore, caution is warranted for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, alcoholic liver disease, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or severe hypovolemia.
