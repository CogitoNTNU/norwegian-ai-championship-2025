Ultrasonography also demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia detection. In cases where the CXR is negative, some diagnostic algorithms recommend performing a lung ultrasound before CT to identify the presence of aspiration pneumonia.[3] **Laboratory Testing** Laboratory evaluation typically reveals acute inflammation and infection signs, such as an elevated white blood cell count (WBC). However, this may not occur in frail older patients as they may be unable to mount an effective response to infection.[1] Currently, no specific biomarker distinguishes aspiration pneumonia from other diseases or even pneumonitis. Some experts suggest using serum procalcitonin levels to differentiate aspiration pneumonia from aspiration pneumonitis. Procalcitonin is a biomarker specific for bacterial infections, and an elevation is expected in the case of aspiration pneumonia.[4] However, its performance in critically ill patients to differentiate between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis has been poor.[1] Alpha-amylase levels in airway secretions have been investigated as potential biochemical markers for aspiration. In a study involving mechanically ventilated patients, elevated alpha-amylase levels were observed in airway secretions; however, their precise relevance to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis remains uncertain.[6] **Diagnostic Algorithm** A recent diagnostic algorithm has been proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and aid in distinguishing it from aspiration pneumonitis. According to the authors of this algorithm, a combination of clinical pneumonia features and characteristic bronchopulmonary findings on radiological assessment is necessary to diagnose aspiration pneumonia. In frail, older patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, along with characteristic radiologic findings, inquiries about the history of known aspiration events should be initiated. Suppose a history of aspiration, along with at least 1 risk factor for oral colonization with a pathogenic or high burden of bacteria, is present. In that case, a definitive diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia can be established.[3] Risk factors for oral colonization include old age, malnutrition, smoking, dry mouth, poor oral hygiene, and antimicrobial use in the preceding 90 days. Additionally, tracheal cannulation, medications that modify gastric pH (eg, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H2 blockers), enteral nutrition, and inhaled corticosteroids are considered risk factors for oral colonization.[3] Patients presenting with clinical and radiological findings suggestive of aspiration pneumonia in the absence of a known history of aspiration before a presentation should be diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia if they possess 1 or more risk factors for oral colonization. Risk factors that elevate the likelihood of aspiration include frailty, prior history of stroke,
