Hg) indicates hypoxemia, which can result from various respiratory disorders. **Bicarbonate** HCO3- is a base that helps buffer the bloodâ€™s pH. The normal HCO3- range is 22 to 26 mmol/L. HCO3- levels reflect the metabolic component of the acid-base balance. Increased HCO3- indicates metabolic alkalosis, while decreased HCO3- indicates metabolic acidosis. **Base excess** Base excess (BE) measures the amount of excess or deficient base in the blood. The normal range is -2 to +2 mmol/L. A positive BE indicates metabolic alkalosis, while a negative BE indicates metabolic acidosis. BE helps assess the metabolic component of acid-base disorders.[8] **Basic Interpretation of ABG Results** ABG analysis is crucial in assessing and managing acid-base imbalance. The body compensates through respiratory or metabolic adjustments to restore balance. Information from ABG analysis helps determine the kind and severity of imbalance, guiding treatment. **Acidosis vs alkalosis** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH and a high PaCO2. The causes of this condition include hypoventilation from conditions such as respiratory depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neuromuscular disorders. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by low pH and HCO3-. Causes may include conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and renal failure. Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a high pH and a low PaCO2. Causes include hyperventilation due to conditions such as anxiety, pain, and hypoxemia. Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by high pH and HCO3-. Possible etiologies include vomiting, diuretic use, and hypokalemia. **Compensation mechanisms** The respiratory system adjusts ventilation to correct metabolic acid-base disturbances (respiratory compensation). An example is increasing ventilation to decrease PaCO2 in metabolic acidosis. Meanwhile, the kidneys adjust bicarbonate reabsorption and hydrogen ion excretion to correct respiratory acid-base disturbances (metabolic compensation). An example is increasing HCO3- reabsorption in chronic respiratory acidosis.[9] ## Issues of Concern **Adjusting Ventilator Settings Based on Arterial Blood Gas Analysis Results** Ventilator setting adjustments are often guided by both clinical evaluation and ABG analysis. Specific strategies are explained below. **Hypoxemia** Hypoxemia is characterized by a low PaO2. Increasing FiO2 can improve oxygenation. However, prolonged high FiO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity. Thus, the goal is to maintain PaO2 within the target range using the lowest FiO2 required. Increasing PEEP is a strategy that improves oxygenation by keeping the alveoli open. Optimal PEEP settings can enhance gas exchange and reduce the risk of atelectasis. Longer Ti can improve oxygenation but may increase auto-PEEP risk if not properly managed. An inverse I:E
