Attention is given to ongoing correction of fluid and electrolytes, as well as intestinal decompression, until adequate bowel function returns during the postoperative period. Patients are monitored clinically for complications relating to the surgical intervention and with laboratory and radiology as needed. Contrast imaging may be used if there is concern for intestinal leaks or ongoing obstruction. Weaning off medications such as opioids that may prolong postoperative ileus is an important aspect of pain management. Wound care is another important aspect of the postoperative period. Adequate mobilization and attention to deep venous thromboprophylaxis with mechanical thromboembolic devices and anticoagulants are important aspects of postoperative care. Depending on the period of SBO, as well as the extent of resection of the small bowel, there may be nutritional depletion, and care to monitor and augment nutrition with the parenteral route may be indicated until the return of bowel function.[39][40] ## Deterrence and Patient Education **Deterrence Strategies** Preventing SBO focuses on reducing modifiable risk factors and implementing measures to lower recurrence. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery face a heightened risk of adhesional SBO, which constitutes the majority of cases. Using minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopy, can significantly decrease adhesion formation compared to open procedures. Additionally, adhesion barriers like sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose applied during surgery may further reduce the likelihood of adhesions. Early repair of abdominal wall hernias, particularly in high-risk individuals, can prevent incarcerated or strangulated hernias that often lead to SBO. Managing chronic medical conditions, such as Crohn disease or radiation enteritis, through adherence to prescribed treatment regimens can minimize complications like strictures and fistulas that predispose patients to obstruction. **Patient Education** Educating patients about SBO is essential for timely recognition and management of the condition. Individuals, especially those with prior abdominal surgeries, cancer, or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, should understand the symptoms and risk factors. Patients should be taught to recognize signs such as abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and an inability to pass stool or gas and to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.[41][42] Preventive measures, such as maintaining a balanced fiber-rich diet, can help avoid obstructions caused by constipation or bezoar formation. Those with a history of obstruction should avoid high-risk foods like persimmons or fibrous vegetables. Patients taking medications that impair bowel motility, such as opioids or anticholinergics, should discuss potential adjustments with their healthcare providers to reduce their risk. **Postoperative Education** Patients recovering from
