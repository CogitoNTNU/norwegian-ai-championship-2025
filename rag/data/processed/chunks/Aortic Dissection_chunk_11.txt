as factors like anatomy, dissection extent, and complications influence outcomes. - Surgical repair - Open surgery for type B dissections is reserved for cases where TEVAR is not feasible or for patients with severe complications. Open repair is associated with a higher risk of paraplegia due to potential spinal cord ischemia. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses of aortic dissection include the following conditions: - Myocardial infarction - Aortic aneurysm - Cardiac tamponade (from another cause) - Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) - Spontaneous pneumothorax - Pulmonary embolism - Stroke or transient ischemic attack ## Prognosis The prognosis of aortic dissection varies significantly depending on multiple factors, including the type and location of the dissection, timing of intervention, and presence of complications. Acute aortic dissection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly when diagnosis and management are delayed. A prompt and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can markedly improve survival outcomes. **Prognosis Based on Dissection Type** - **Stanford type A dissections** - Mortality without treatment - Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the high risk of fatal complications, such as cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Without intervention, the mortality rate increases by 1% to 2% per hour within the first 24 to 48 hours, reaching nearly 50% by the end of the first week. - Surgical mortality - With prompt surgical repair, the in-hospital mortality rate for type A dissections is around 15% to 30%, depending on factors such as patient age, presence of comorbidities, and intraoperative complications. Despite successful surgical intervention, long-term mortality remains high due to risks of recurrence, progressive aortic disease, and associated complications. - Long-term outcomes - The 5-year survival rate after surgical repair is approximately 70% to 80%, while the 10-year survival rate decreases to around 50% to 60%. Late mortality is often due to complications such as aortic aneurysms, redissection, and cardiovascular events. - **Stanford type B dissections** - Prognosis with medical management - Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed conservatively with blood pressure control. The in-hospital mortality rate for medically managed type B dissections is around 10% to 15%. Patients who remain stable during the acute phase have a relatively favorable short-term prognosis. - Prognosis with complications - Complicated type B dissections, such as those associated with malperfusion syndromes, rupture, or rapid expansion, carry a higher risk of adverse outcomes. In these cases, in-hospital mortality
