superiority in reducing MR but also supported the long-term safety of the edge-to-edge repair device and its durability in reducing MR.[10][11] The edge-to-edge leaflet repair device is a minimally invasive, catheter-based therapy based on the principle of the "Alfieri stitch," a surgical technique pioneered by Dr. Ottavio Alfieri, an Italian cardiothoracic surgeon. This technique involves bringing together the 2 flailing leaflets of the MV, resulting in reduced or eliminated regurgitation. Typically, this repair creates a double orifice based on the surgical edge-to-edge Alfieri repair.[12][13] Many percutaneous options exist for patients with MR and multiple comorbidities, placing them at higher risk for surgical interventions.[14] These percutaneous techniques can be classified based on the specific site of the mitral apparatus they target, such as the leaflets (edge-to-edge repair), annulus (indirect or direct annuloplasty), chordae (neo-chords, percutaneous chord implantation), or left ventricle (percutaneous left ventricle remodeling).[14][15][16] This article discusses primary and secondary MR and noninvasive catheter management options, including their indications, contraindications, procedural techniques, and complications. The primary focus of the discussion will be on the United States Food and Drug Administration's approved edge-to-edge repair devices. ## Anatomy and Physiology Andreas Vesalius first suggested the name "mitral" for the left-sided atrioventricular valve, given its resemblance with a bishop's miter.[17][18] The mitral valve apparatus is a complex anatomic structure that includes the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, mitral annulus, subvalvular structures (chordae tendineae, papillary muscles) and left ventricle (see **Images.** Mitral Valve Anatomy and Mitral Valve, Transverse View). The mitral annulus is a saddle-shaped structure; the competence of the mitral valve depends on the correct interaction of different components of the mitral valve apparatus.[2][18][19] The anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve should "coapt" to prevent MR during systole. An alteration in the functioning of any mitral valve component can lead to the development of MR.[20] The 2 types of MR are primary and secondary. Primary MR is a degenerative valve disease, while secondary MR is characteristically a functional myocardial disease, ie, ventricular remodeling (see **Table 1.** Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation).

Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation. Primary and secondary MR are further classified into stages A through D (see **Table 2.** Stages of Primary Mitral Regurgitation and **Table 3.** Stages of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation), indicating whether they are mild, moderate, or severe. Several interventions exist to treat severe MR, including surgical and nonsurgical. Patients with severe MR
