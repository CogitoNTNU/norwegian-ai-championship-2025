plethysmography. Patients with diabetes may have a regular appearing ABI but abnormal PVR or velocities from duplex imaging.[17] **Pulse volume recording (PVR)** The downstream disease can affect proximal waveforms, which can be confounding. ## Complications Patient discomfort with inflation of occlusive cuffs. While noninvasive modalities can shed light on the quality of forwarding flow, they are not always predictive of healing potential following an amputation.[18] ## Patient Safety and Education Patients should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. There are no dietary restrictions necessary for these tests, nor should patients stop any previously prescribed medications. ## Clinical Significance For patients with the suspected peripheral arterial disease on history and physical exam, noninvasive imaging (ABI with PPG, toe pressure with PVR) is a reasonable next step for further evaluation before the contrast-enhanced scan or more invasive treatment. Continuous-wave Doppler is a quick, facile bedside adjunct to assess blood flow within a vessel. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=127284&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=127284) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/127284/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=127284) ## References 1.
