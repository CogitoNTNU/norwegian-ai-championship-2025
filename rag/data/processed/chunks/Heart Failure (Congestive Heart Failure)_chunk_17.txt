performance, and long-term outcomes in HF management. Structured communication strategies, such as interdisciplinary rounds and shared electronic health records, ensure seamless information exchange among clinicians. Clinical pharmacists work closely with physicians and nurses to review patient medication lists, optimize pharmacologic therapy, and prevent adverse drug-drug interactions, thereby improving medication safety. Collaboration between primary care clinicians and cardiologists helps ensure continuity of care, minimize adverse effects of medical therapy, and slow disease progression. A well-coordinated, team-based approach significantly improves the quality of life for HF patients by integrating medical, pharmacologic, and lifestyle interventions while reducing hospitalizations and mortality. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22661&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22661) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/congestive-heart-failure-chf/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22661) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22661/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22661) [![Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph](/books/NBK430873/bin/cHF.gif)](/books/NBK430873/figure/article-22661.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK430873/figure/article-22661.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph.
