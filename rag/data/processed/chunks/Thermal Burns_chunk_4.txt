common, is another important complication to remember. Before hyperbaric therapy is initiated, patients should be fully evaluated for a pre-existing pneumothorax, which should be managed before starting treatment. An untreated pneumothorax is the only absolute contraindication to hyperbaric therapy.[9] Systemic oxygen toxicity from hyperbaric therapy can also cause a rare yet concerning side effect: seizures. Hyperic-induced seizures have an incidence of about 0.011%, according to a retrospective analysis of 2,334 patients.[10] They have also been associated with patients receiving certain medications, including insulin, steroids, thyroid replacement therapy, and sympathomimetics, and thus, patients on these medications should be carefully monitored during sessions.[11] If seizures do occur, they should be managed acutely by reducing the Fi02 concentration to that of air (21%), administering anticonvulsant therapy, and stopping hyperbaric treatment as soon as possible.[9] ## Clinical Significance **In summary, HBO therapy during the first 24 hours of burn has shown to:** 1. Decrease edema by vasoconstriction and decrease the chance of burn shock 1. Decrease wound infections 1. Promote epithelialization 1. Increase the viability of skin flaps and grafts 1. Be effective against carbon monoxide and smoke inhalation injury 1. Reduce fluid requirements of the patient 1. Counteract ischemia in tissue by raising oxygen levels in hypoxic tissue to supraphysiologic levels **Twenty-four hours after thermal burn injuries, HBO has shown to:** 1. Relieve a paralytic ileus 1. Decrease the incidence of Cushing ulcers 1. Reduce hypertrophic scarring and ulceration 1. Counteracts burn encephalopathy/cerebral edema 1. Reduce the length of hospital stay 1. Reduce the need for surgery ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Thermal burns are best managed by an interprofessional team, including a wound care nurse. While the treatment in most patients is supportive, recent evidence indicates that HBO therapy may help wounds heal faster. However, the vascular status of the wound must be assessed because without adequate blood supply, HBO therapy may not always work, and empirically sending every patient for HBO therapy is not cost-effective. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23152&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23152) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/thermal-injury-treatment/hyperbaric-treatment-of-thermal-burns-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23152) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23152/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23152) [![Image ](/books/NBK470524/bin/thermal__burn.gif)](/books/NBK470524/figure/article-23152.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470524/figure/article-23152.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Thermal Burn DermNet New Zealand [![Thermal Burn, Third Degree](/books/NBK470524/bin/Thermal__Burn__3rd__degree.gif)](/books/NBK470524/figure/article-23152.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470524/figure/article-23152.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Thermal Burn, Third Degree.
