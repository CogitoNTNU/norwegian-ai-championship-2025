treatment of these patients for up to 24 hours. **Acute Hospital Management** [34] - **Blood pressure:** The guidelines suggest blood pressure (BP) management of \<180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after IV TPA. The 2023 AHA guidelines also recommended that in patients for whom mechanical thrombectomy is planned and who have not received IV fibrinolytic therapy, it is reasonable to maintain BP ≤185/110 mm Hg before the procedure.[40] A new recommendation is lowering BP initially by 15% in patients with comorbid conditions such as acute heart failure or aortic dissection. Antihypertensive management does not prevent death or dependency in patients with BP \<220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA and have no comorbid conditions requiring blood pressure reduction. The theoretical risk of BP lowering is the potential reduction of perfusion to the ischemic areas, which is pressure-dependent. The risk applies to the first 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke. For patients with a BP ≥220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA, the guideline suggests it may be reasonable to reduce BP by 15% in the first 24 hours, although the benefit is uncertain. A large trial recently published showed a U-shaped curve correlating acute MAP and stroke clinical outcomes. The ideal mean systolic BP is 135 mm Hg to 150 mm Hg.[40] Antihypertensive options include the following: ``` * Labetalol 10 to 20 mg IV; may repeat once * Nicardipine 5 mg/hour IV. Increase 2.5 mg/hour every 5 to 15 minutes. The maximum dose is 15 mg/hour. * Clevidipine 1 to 2 mg/hour IV. Double dose every 15 minutes. Maximum 21 mg/hour. * Hydralazine and enalaprilat may be considered. ``` Hypotension and hypovolemia should be avoided because cerebral perfusion pressure is dependent on the maintenance of an elevated MAP as ICP increases due to an ischemic event (see **Image.** Cushing Reaction: CNS Ischemic Response). - **Temperature:** Hyperthermia >38 °C should be avoided and treated appropriately. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen may be used. Common sources of infection, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, should be ruled out. There is insufficient data to support therapeutic hypothermia in acute ischemic strokes currently. A retrospective study recently demonstrated an association between a peak temperature >39 °C (100.4 °F) in the first 24 hours and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. - **Glucose:** Maintain glucose in the 140 to 180 mg/dL range in the first
