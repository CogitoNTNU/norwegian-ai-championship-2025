Unlike the younger patient, the management of cervical spine injury in the elderly patient remains controversial. Making the treatment more difficult is that many elderly patients also have numerous comorbidities. Thus, these patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes trauma surgery, orthopedics, physical therapy, and medical doctors. No matter what treatment approach is undertaken, one should consider the patient's age, comorbidity and potential complication of the procedure. Many elderly patients may not be candidates for surgery, and one also has to take into account the post-procedure quality of life.[12] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=38689&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=38689) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/joint-muscle-and-bone/geriatric-cervical-spine-injury/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=38689) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/38689/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=38689) ## References 1.
