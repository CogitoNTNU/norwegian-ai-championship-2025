Assessment of ventricular activation interval upon cessation of atrial overdrive pacing (ventricular activation linking) to differentiate atrial tachycardia from AVNRT/AVRT - When the first V-A interval immediately following the last atrial paced beat—measured from at least 2 different atrial pacing sites (eg, right atrium, proximal coronary sinus, and distal coronary sinus)—differs by 14 milliseconds or less, it supports a diagnosis of AVRT or AVNRT.[12] Greater differences in ventricular activation intervals support a diagnosis of atrial tachycardia. - Assessment of the cessation response (AH-HA versus A-H-A) to differentiate AVNRT from junctional tachycardia - When AOP is stopped and tachycardia resumes, the electrogram displays distinct patterns depending on the type of tachycardia that has occurred. In junctional tachycardia, the response is an "Atrial-His-His-Atrial" (AH-HA) sequence (see **Image.** Atrial Overdrive Pacing Response in Junctional Tachycardia). This occurs because the tachycardia resumes with a junctional beat initiated by a His signal immediately after pacing stops. In contrast, in AVNRT, cessation of AOP typically results in the tachycardia resuming with an atrial beat first, producing an "atrial-His-atrial" (A-H-A) sequence on the electrogram.[13] - Response to atrial extrastimuli during tachycardia to differentiate AVNRT from junctional tachycardia - This maneuver is specifically used to distinguish between AVNRT and junctional tachycardia. An atrial extrastimulus, known as a premature atrial contraction (PAC), is delivered at various points during the TCL. Key observations are made based on the following 2 scenarios: - When the PAC is timed to coincide with the refractoriness of the His bundle (late PAC response) - When the PAC is timed before the His refractoriness (early PAC response) If a late PAC affects the timing of the subsequent His depolarization, it strongly suggests the involvement of anterograde slow pathway conduction. This finding is typically associated with AVNRT. However, a negative response (ie, no change in His timing) is nondiagnostic. In contrast, if an early PAC advances the immediate His potential without terminating the tachycardia, it is a strong indicator of junctional tachycardia (see **Image.** Response to Early Premature Atrial Contraction in Junctional Tachycardia vs Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia). This observation suggests that the tachycardia circuit does not depend on a retrograde fast pathway through the AV node, which is typically involved in AVNRT. Other responses, such as no change in the immediate His timing, followed by tachycardia termination, delay, or further advancement, are considered nondiagnostic.[14][15] **Footnotes** When the pacing cycle length does not shorten or 1:1
