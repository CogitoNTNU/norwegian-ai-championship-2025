fevers, chills, dyspnea, orthopnea, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Patients can also present with a transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure symptoms. On physical exam, patients with aortic valve endocarditis may demonstrate an aortic insufficiency diastolic murmur (new or change in preexisting murmur), and signs of heart failure if aortic valve function is compromised. Other sequelae may include neurological findings such as vision loss, weakness, or peripheral stigmata of the disease as described above including splinter hemorrhages, Osler nodes, Roth spots, Janeway lesions, organomegaly, and hematuria if kidneys are involved. Signs of neurological dysfunction due to an embolic stroke may be found in at least 1/3rd of patients. Other features of infective endocarditis include confusion, delirium, pallor, lethargy, arrhythmias, and anorexia. ## Evaluation The Modified Duke Criteria are applicable in the evaluation of patients suspected of infective endocarditis. Three categories include definite infective endocarditis, possible infective endocarditis, or rejected infective endocarditis.[5] Definite infective endocarditis further subclassifies into[6][5]\[7\]: - Definite infective endocarditis by pathological criteria: where microorganisms are present on culture or histologic examination of the vegetation, embolized vegetation or an intracardiac abscess, or pathological lesions demonstrating active endocarditis - Definite infective endocarditis by clinical criteria: defined by the presence of two major criteria, one major criterion plus three minor criteria, or five minor criteria in The Modified Duke Criteria Major clinical criteria are defined as follows\[5\]: - Multiple positive blood cultures, single positive culture for _Coxiella burnetii_ or antiphase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1 to 800 - Endocardial involvement (presence of new valvular regurgitation) - Presence of vegetation, abscess, or dehiscence (worsening or a change of pre-existing murmur does not meet criteria) Minor clinical criteria are as follows\[5\]: - Predisposing heart condition or use of intravenous drug use - Fever with body temperature greater than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) - Vascular phenomena: arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesion - Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, rheumatoid factor, and - Positive blood culture that does not meet the major criteria Possible infective endocarditis criteria are when there are one major criterion and one minor criterion or three minor criteria present. Rejected infective endocarditis is defined when there is likely an alternative diagnosis, or there is no pathological evidence of IE with fewer than 4 days of antibiotic therapy or there is the resolution of
