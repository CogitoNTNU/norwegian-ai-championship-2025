the U.S. in 2017, showing significant benefits for diagnosing and excluding acute myocardial infarction.[57] The new hs-cTn assays have higher analytical sensitivity—less than 10% imprecision at very low troponin concentrations.[4] High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays must meet analytical criteria established by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Biomarkers (C-CB) and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Academy, which focus on imprecision at the 99th percentile upper reference limit and the ability to measure hs-cTn in ≥50% of males and ≥50% of females above the limit of detection (LoD) within a regular healthy cohort.[58] Two challenges limit the ease of switching from one troponin assay to another in clinical practice or research. First, no primary reference cTnI material is currently available for manufacturers to standardize cTnI assays.[59] Second, measured assay concentrations fail to be consistent because cTnI circulates in various forms; the antibodies used in the available assays recognize different epitopes of cTnI even for assays and instruments marketed by the same manufacturer.[60] ## Interfering Factors One problem with using troponins to diagnose acute myocardial infarctions is that troponins can be elevated in other conditions as well.[61] Anything that causes damage to cardiac muscle can cause troponin to spill into circulation. The most common cause of injury is oxygen supply and demand mismatch, seen in acute myocardial infarction.[62] However, many other conditions can cause this mismatch and cause elevated troponins. For example, tachycardia can cause decreased perfusion due to reduced diastolic time when coronary blood flow occurs and oxygen demand increases.[63] Patients in shock can also have a supply and demand mismatch due to low blood volume, and elevated troponins in these patients are indicative of worse outcomes.[64] Another cause of elevated troponin levels is cardiac muscle injury due to non-ischemic causes. Direct, blunt trauma to the chest can cause significant myocardial damage and, in turn, can lead to increased troponin.[65] In a study of 333 blunt chest trauma patients, elevated troponin was found in 144 (44%) patients.[66] Inflammatory conditions such as viral myocarditis and infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis have also been shown to cause elevations in troponins.[67] Troponin leaks can also occur with processes outside of the heart. For example, troponin elevations have been seen frequently in patients with acute strokes, although they have no evidence of coronary artery disease.[68] One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is that there
