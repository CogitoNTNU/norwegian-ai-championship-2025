levels with oxygen administration under pressure. It has been shown to decrease edema through vasoconstriction, preserve microcirculation, and enhance oxygen delivery by a direct osmotic effect. HBO also aids in the deactivation of white cell adhesion. Most studies of hyperbaric treatment of burns have been reported using various animal burn models, showing that HBO therapy is beneficial in reducing edema, decreasing fluid requirements, preserving dermal structures with improved vascularity, and increasing immune response. In human studies, the results have varied but support the potential benefit of HBO therapy as an adjunct therapy.[4] A Cochrane review was published in 2004 that looked at 2 small randomized trials. These studies demonstrated improved healing, decreased mortality, reduced hospital stay, and decreased need for surgery.[5] However, some studies have shown little to no benefit with HBO therapy. Insufficient evidence is available to support the routine use of patients with thermal burns, although it is a widely used adjunct therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen does have the potential to decrease healing time and fluid requirements, as well as increase the success of skin grafts, but more studies must be conducted to adopt this into routine practice as this therapy requires complex equipment, procedures, and specialized skills in a constricted environment, which may become unsafe when caring for critically ill burn patients. ## Anatomy and Physiology Thermal burns are classified by the depth of the tissue injury. The American Burn Association has established 4 classifications: **Superficial:** These injuries involve the epidermal layer of the skin. They do not blister but can be painful. They usually self-resolve within 1 week. **Partial Thickness (second-degree):** Involve the epidermal layer and parts of the dermal layer. Superficial partial-thickness blisters are painful but resolve within 21 days and usually do not cause scarring. Deep partial-thickness burns always blister and cause damage to hair follicles and glandular tissue. Deep partial-thickness burns are extremely painful. These burns can get infected and may need to be grafted depending on the extent of the injury. These injuries take up to 9 weeks to heal and form hypertrophic scarring. **Full Thickness (third-degree):** These burns go through the dermal layer and frequently injure subcutaneous tissue. Burn eschars, or the denatured dermal layer, is intact acutely. The wound may be anesthetic due to the necrotic nature of the burn. The appearance can be waxy or grey to black. The eschar of the burn eventually falls off, revealing a bed of
