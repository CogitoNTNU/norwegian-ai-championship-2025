It continues to remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, especially in middle and lower-income countries. It is divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) or late-onset sepsis (LOS) based on the age of presentation after birth, with different experts using 72 hours or 7 days as the cutoff. This activity describes the treatment and evaluation of neonatal sepsis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Assess the etiology of early and late-onset neonatal sepsis. - Evaluate various clinical and laboratory findings associated with neonatal sepsis - Differentiate the various treatment and management options available for neonatal sepsis. - Communicate the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for neonates affected by sepsis.

It remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates, especially in middle and lower-income countries [1]. Neonatal sepsis is divided into 2 groups based on the time of presentation after birth: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis in neonates at or before 72 hours of life (some experts use 7 days), and LOS is defined as sepsis occurring at or after 72 hours of life [2]. ## Etiology EOS is generally caused by the transmission of pathogens from the female genitourinary system to the newborn or the fetus. These pathogens can ascend the vagina, the cervix, and the uterus and can also infect the amniotic fluid. Neonates can also become infected in utero or during delivery as they pass through the vaginal canal. Typical bacterial pathogens for EOS include group B streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenza, and Listeria monocytogenes. Maternal factors that increase the risk of neonatal sepsis include chorioamnionitis, GBS colonization, delivery before 37 weeks, and prolonged rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours [3].
