or a left bundle branch block (LBBB) 1. Presence of pathological Q waves on electrocardiogram (ECG) 1. New regional wall motion abnormality on imaging study 1. Presence of an intracoronary thrombus at autopsy or angiography ## Etiology Acute myocardial infarction occurs due to decreased coronary blood flow, leading to insufficient oxygen supply to the heart and cardiac ischemia. Decreased coronary blood flow is multifactorial. Atherosclerotic plaques classically rupture and lead to thrombosis, contributing to acutely decreased blood flow in the coronary. Other etiologies of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery embolism, which accounts for 2.9% of patients, cocaine-induced ischemia, coronary dissection, and coronary vasospasm.[4][5] **Nonmodifiable Risk Factors** - Sex - Age - Family history - Male pattern baldness **Modifiable Risk Factors** - Smoking - Dyslipidemia - Diabetes mellitus - Hypertension - Obesity - Sedentary lifestyle - Poor oral hygiene - Presence of peripheral vascular disease - Elevated levels of homocysteine **Other Causes of MI** - Trauma - Vasculitis - Drug use (cocaine) - Coronary artery anomalies - Coronary artery emboli - Aortic dissection - Excess demand on the heart (hyperthyroidism, anemia) ## Epidemiology Approximately 70% of fatal AMI cases are attributed to occlusion caused by atherosclerotic plaques. As atherosclerosis is the predominant cause of AMI, risk-factors for atherosclerotic disease are often mitigated in disease prevention. Modifiable risk factors account for 90% of AMI cases in men and 94% in women. These modifiable risk factors include cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, obesity, elevated cholesterol levels (particularly LDL), and high triglyceride levels. In contrast, age, sex, and family history are nonmodifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis and AMI.[6][7] ## Pathophysiology The rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque initiates an inflammatory response of monocytes and macrophages, leading to thrombus formation and platelet aggregation. This process decreases oxygen delivery through the coronary artery, resulting in inadequate oxygenation of the myocardium (see **Image.** Specimen Showing MI). The subsequent inability to produce ATP in the mitochondria triggers an ischemic cascade, ultimately leading to apoptosis (cell death) of the endocardium or myocardial infarction. With some exceptions due to genetic variation, coronary arteries exhibit unique and diagnostic territorial distributions. For example, the left anterior descending coronary artery supplies blood flow to the interventricular septum, anterolateral wall, and ventricular apex. The left circumflex artery supplies blood to the inferolateral wall. The right coronary artery supplies the right ventricle. The inferior wall is supplied either by the left circumflex or right coronary artery.[8]
