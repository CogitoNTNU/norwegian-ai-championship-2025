clamping [14] - Fire accidents and explosions - High voltage electric shock and lightning strikes, which also cause direct injury to the sarcoplasmic membrane, with massive calcium influx, along with severe rhabdomyolysis [15] - Strenuous muscular exercise (especially in untrained individuals), lifting heavy weights, performing under exceedingly hot conditions, status epilepticus, tetanus, and rarely sepsis [16][17] **Nontraumatic or Nonphysical Causes** Nontraumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis can occur from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, electrolyte changes, and metabolic abnormalities. - Medications: rhabdomyolysis is a common adverse effect of many medications, particularly statins. - Infections: viral myositis is most common, and recently, SARS-CoV-2 is commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis.[18] See below for sepsis/bacterial infection. - Electrolyte abnormalities: hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperosmolar conditions, hypo- and hypercalcemia, and severe dehydration.[19] - Endocrine: hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis with coma, myxedema. - Congenital myopathies: most common are myotonic dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy. See below for further details.[20] - Toxins: insect bite, snake venom, hornet sting, carbon monoxide, Haff disease, and mushroom poisoning.[21] - Autoimmune myositis: polymyositis, dermatomyositis.

[23] - Drugs: Both drug intoxication and drug withdrawal can cause rhabdomyolysis. **Statins** Statins are the most common pharmaceutical to cause rhabdomyolysis. Up to 10% of patients taking statins experience muscle pain.[3] With the increased use of lipid-lowering drugs, the incidence of rhabdomyolysis from HMG Co-A inhibitors is rising. Muscle toxicity from statins ranges from myopathy, myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Proposed mechanisms are CoQ10 depletion-causing myocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of cellular respiration, impaired calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, and anti-HMG Co-A inhibitors. Statins commonly cause toxic myopathy, associated with no muscle necrosis and CPK less than 1000 U/L, and rarely autoimmune myopathy, associated with CPK greater than 1000 U/L and muscle necrosis.[24] Discontinuation of statins is an effective treatment method for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. However, persistent elevation of CPK after discontinuation of statins should raise concern for necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Concomitant use of other medications like gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and corticosteroids poses an increased risk for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Clinically significant rhabdomyolysis requiring hospital admission was noted in about 0.44 per 10000 patients treated with
