can damage the conus, especially in low-lying conus or achondroplasia. It is best to consult neurology, neurosurgery in these patients. **Meningitis:** Proper techniques of disinfection avoid infection. **Headache:** Typically, 20 or 22G needles have a reported incidence of 2.2% for FGLP while varies between 20.5 to 26.4% under blind technique.[13] The headache takes one day to appear, peaks after an additional day, and takes one day to disappear. Post lumbar puncture headache increases with lower gauge needles. Unlike cutting Quincke needles (regular spinal needles), non-cutting Sprotte or Whitacre needles cause fewer headaches. Single dural puncture and replacing the stylus before withdrawing the needle decreases the probability of post-spinal headache. The bevel position perpendicular to the long axis of the nerves while entering the dura also reduced the risk of headache.[14][15] Many patients improve without any treatment.[16] Although advised and practiced universally, the strict bed rest after the LP has no demonstrable bearing on the headache; however, patients generally are recommended to take 2-hour bed rest.[17] Caffeine may help reduce the headache.[18] In refractory cases, a fluoroscopy-guided epidural blood patch is an effective treatment.[19] **Vascular injury:** A long needle can injure the posterior wall of the aorta by passing through the intervertebral disc, causing hematoma and pseudo-aneurysm. When the needle penetrates the aortic wall, fresh arterial blood spurts through the needle, the needle also pulsates along with the aortic pulsations. A lateral radiograph can confirm the retroperitoneal extent of the needle. When the arterial injury is suspected, we recommend consulting a vascular surgeon. It is essential to closely monitor the patient for hemodynamic stability. The reduction of the aortic pressure also helps to stabilize the hematoma. CT angiogram can be performed to look for active extravasation and stability of the hematoma. If the hematoma is felt to be stable, consider slowly removing the needle and then placing the patient supine for the tamponade effect on the aorta to stabilize the hematoma.[20] **Radiation:** The average procedure time for the FGLP ranges between 12 min (range 12-30 min, SD 6) and the average radiation dose area product DAP of 10 Gy√ócm(2) (range 0.1-70, SD 11) and average effective dose estimate of 2.9 mSv (range 0.9-9.4, SD 1.9).[21] ## Clinical Significance LP is one of the most common bedside procedures performed in the office, emergency department, or inpatient location. LP is required to diagnose infection, demyelinating process, malignancy, and also for myelography and cisternography.
