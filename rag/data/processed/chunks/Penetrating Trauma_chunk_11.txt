and strained relationships. This may also reduce attention and cognitive function, increasing the risk of dementia. While noise can affect work performance, the extent of this impact often depends on individual predisposition. Additionally, the financial burden of hearing loss and compensation costs for employers can be significant. ## Deterrence and Patient Education The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that hearing loss is among the 20 leading causes of disease burden and the most common disability globally. NIHL is the most preventable cause of hearing loss. However, AAT may be less predictable and preventable in occupational or military settings. A critical component of prevention efforts is education at all levels. Individuals at risk, such as military personnel, must understand that hearing can only be protected through efforts to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. The importance of wearing HPDs and referring individuals to specialists after AAT—regardless of the level of hearing loss—should be emphasized in hearing conservation programs. ## Pearls and Other Issues AAT presents various challenges and considerations in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Critical facts to keep in mind regarding AAT include: - AAT can be prevented with the use of hearing protection. - Hearing loss resulting from blast injuries may recover spontaneously in some cases. - The underlying pathophysiology likely involves changes to the middle ear muscles and cochlea. - AAT may also be underreported and undertreated, highlighting the need for increased awareness. - Evaluation begins with a thorough otomicroscopy and audiometry assessment. - Treatment should be individualized, with realistic expectations communicated to each patient, as permanent hearing loss remains a possibility. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Providing patient-centered care for individuals experiencing AAT (acute acoustic trauma) requires a collaborative effort among various healthcare professionals, including physicians, advanced practice practitioners, nurses, audiologists, speech therapists, and others. Healthcare providers must have the necessary clinical skills and expertise to diagnose, evaluate, and treat patients suffering from AAT. This includes surgical proficiency in understanding the middle ear and temporal bone anatomy, recognizing potential complications, and being aware of the timing nuances in diagnostics and treatment. A strategic approach that involves evidence-based guidelines and individualized care plans tailored to each patient's unique circumstances is vital. Care coordination is crucial for ensuring seamless and efficient patient management, especially since AAT is often underreported and underestimated. Physicians, audiologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey—from the initial diagnosis of hearing
