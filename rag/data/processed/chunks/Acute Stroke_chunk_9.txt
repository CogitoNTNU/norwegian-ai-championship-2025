Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, there was a significant increase in the annual number of strokes (ischemic, ICH, SAH, and all types of strokes combined) and deaths attributed to stroke between 1990 and 2019.[22] According to a population-based cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom, it was found that 5 years following a first stroke (including ischemic, ICH, SAH, and cases with uncertain type), 47% of patients were deceased, and 39% were living with disabilities.[59] Based on a longitudinal observational study of the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke), it was found that the survival rates differed between patients with ischemic stroke and those with ICH. At 30 days after a first stroke, 89.9% of patients with ischemic stroke were alive compared to 69.3% of patients with ICH. Although early mortality was higher for patients diagnosed with ICH, beyond 30 days, survival declined at a similar rate for both groups. However, the proportion of functionally dependent survivors remained consistently higher for patients with ICH at all time points. The study found that at 5 years, the survival rate was 49.4% for ischemic stroke and 37.8% for ICH. The authors concluded that 5 years after a first stroke, over 65% of patients with ischemic stroke and over 75% of patients with ICH were either deceased or functionally dependent.[60] According to a large national cohort study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, among patients hospitalized with a first stroke (including ischemic stroke, ICH, SAH, and cases with unspecified type), the survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 52.8% and 36.4%, respectively. The study also reported a cumulative incidence of stroke recurrence of 19.8% at 5 years and 26.8% at 10 years.[61] In a population-based study conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on patients aged 18 to 49 who survived for at least 30 days after experiencing a first stroke (including ischemic stroke, ICH, and stroke not otherwise specified), it was observed that the risk of mortality remained elevated compared to the general population for up to 15 years following the stroke.[62] In a population-based cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom, it was observed that the rate of stroke recurrence within 5 years decreased from 18% among individuals who experienced a stroke (including ischemic, ICH, and SAH) between 1995 and 1999 to 12% among those who had a stroke between 2000 and 2005. However, there has been no further reduction
