by Plasmodium falciparum, the malarial parasite, is a crucial enzyme for the generation of energy in the parasite. Since these malarial parasites lack a tricarboxylic acid cycle for ATP formation, anaerobic glycolysis serves as a source of energy.[28] The inhibitors of _Plasmodium falciparum_ LDH would only be directed towards the parasite and would selectively kill the parasite. Most invasive tumors undergo a metabolic switching (Warburg effect) from oxidative phosphorylation to higher anaerobic glycolysis. This switch occurs through upregulation of the LDH-5 (also called LDH-A), the isoform normally present in muscles and the liver.[22] Hence, inhibition of LDH-5 can specifically target the site of tumor progression and invasiveness. An analog, N-hydroyxindole class LDH inhibitors are also tested effectively as anticancer agents.[29][30] Many clinical trials and translational data demonstrated that targeting LDHA genes or its protein product LDH-5 may be harnessed as a metabolic treatment of cancer.[31][28] Researchers have conducted clinical trials in melanoma patients with low LDH, and treatment with Ipilimumab showed higher efficacy when treatment started with low baseline LDH.[32][33] Another trial using a combination of Bcl2 antisense oligonucleotide plus dacarbazine also showed efficacy in patients with low baseline LDH.[34] Thus, the overall importance of LDH as a tumor marker becomes masked because of its low sensitivity and specificity.[35] High LDL levels are usually associated with advanced stages of cancer.[36] The deficiency of the enzyme LDH is very rare, and not much data is available for its prevalence. This deficiency can result from either the mutations in the LDHA gene or the LDHB gene leading to a deficiency in LDH-A (M- subunit protein) and LDH-B (H-subunit protein) proteins, respectively.[37] LDHA gene mutations result in the formation of an abnormal M subunit protein. This protein subunit cannot bind to other subunits to form the LDH enzyme. LDHA gene mutation mostly affects skeletal muscles, because skeletal LDH has all M-subunits. However, a lack of a functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme formed in all other tissues as well. This chemistry results in an ineffective breakdown of glycogen. Hence, LDHA gene deficiency is also called glycogen storage disease XI. The unavailability of sufficient energy, especially to the muscle cells, causes muscle weakness and breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis).[38] The effect is more pronounced during strenuous activities, and muscle tissue destruction releases protein myoglobin. This protein is processed in the kidneys and released in the urine, causing myoglobinuria. The high accumulation of myoglobin
