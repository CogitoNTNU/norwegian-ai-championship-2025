be consulted if there is suspicion of infection or MI as the trigger. The pharmacist and nurses should determine if the patient was compliant with insulin treatment. Following discharge, the social workers should be involved in the care since recurrent DKA admissions are common, especially in inner-city hospitals. Socioeconomic status, education status, access to insulin, the presence of health care coverage, and the presence of mental illness, etc. play a big role in these patients. An interprofessional team, including social workers, are often needed to address these particular situations. Meticulous discharge planning, involving social workers for patients with socioeconomic needs, and hospital initiated follow up clinics for discharged patients are some of the factors important to reduce the recurrences of DKA in the same individual. Finally, patient education is highly recommended, as in many cases, the cause of DKA is failing to comply with treatment. **Outcomes** In developed countries, the morbidity and mortality rates are low chiefly because of a streamlined interprofessional approach to the management of these patients. However, in developing countries, mortality rates of 0.3 to 2.5% are still reported. The major cause of death in most young patients is cerebral edema. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=74978&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=74978) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diabetes/adult-diabetic-ketoacidosis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=74978) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/74978/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=74978) ## References 1.
