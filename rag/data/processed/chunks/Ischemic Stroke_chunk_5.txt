glycolysis ensues, resulting in tissue acidosis due to lactic acid accumulation. Neuronal electrical failure occurs at a cerebral blood flow of 16 to 18 mL/100 g/min, followed by failure of membrane ion homeostasis at 10 to 12 mL/100 g/min.[19] This threshold typically marks the onset of infarction. In hypertensive individuals, autoregulation adapts to operate at higher arterial pressures. Lowering blood pressure to normal levels in such individuals could exacerbate autoregulation dysfunction during stroke, leading to further reductions in cerebral blood flow. **Concept of the Ischemic Penumbra** During an acute ischemic stroke, the brain tissue that relies exclusively on 1 artery for its blood supply will suffer an infarct, forming what is known as the infarct core.[20] Surrounding this core is an area of brain tissue called the ischemic penumbra, which maintains some blood supply through collateral circulation. However, as swelling from the infarction grows, the penumbra diminishes, and the infarct core expands. Under normal conditions, cerebral perfusion is approximately 50 mL/100 g/min. Brain cells begin to die when perfusion drops below 30%, equivalent to \<15 mL/100 g/min. Hence, when blood flow is reduced but remains above 30% of the normal rate, the brain tissue is ischemic but not infarcted, highlighting the critical principle that "time is brain." This principle underscores the importance of timely revascularization treatments in acute ischemic stroke, given the distinct time windows for intervention based on these physiological insights.[21][22][23] **Ischemic Stroke Syndromes** Ischemic strokes can present in predetermined syndromes due to decreased blood flow to particular areas of the brain that correlate to exam findingsâ€”allowing clinicians to predict the site of the brain vasculature that can be affected. **Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Infarction** The MCA is the most common artery involved in stroke (see **Images.** Left MCA Territory Infarction and Right-Sided MDA 'Cord Sign' Harbingering Acute Infection). The MCA is divided into 4 segments (M1, M2, M3, and M4) and supplies a large area of the lateral surface of the brain, part of the basal ganglia, and the internal capsule. The M1 (horizontal) segment gives off the lenticulostriate arteries, which supply the basal ganglia and internal capsule. The M1 segment continues to the M2 (Sylvian) segment and supplies the insula, superior temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and inferolateral frontal lobe.

The MCA distribution involves the lateral cerebral cortex. MCA syndrome is best explained by understanding the
