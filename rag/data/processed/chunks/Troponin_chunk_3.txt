for troponin measurement in the setting of chest pain should be 60 minutes, and individual laboratories should strive to achieve this time.[37] ## Diagnostic Tests In the emergency department setting, it is impossible to follow troponin levels completely from rising to peak to fall.[29] When a patient presents complaining of chest pain, a diagnostic decision has to be made promptly. To help guide decision-making in the emergency setting, myocardial infarctions are divided into two categories using ECG findings; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI).[38] In STEMIs, patients will have an elevated troponin and one of the following ECG changes: ST-segment elevations greater than 1 mm in contiguous leads with reciprocal changes, new evidence of a left bundle branch block, or ST-segment elevations noted on a posterior ECG.[39] In this scenario, the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are simple. The patient likely has a major blockage of a coronary vessel and requires emergent coronary catheterization, if available or thrombolytic therapy to open the blocked vessel and reperfuse the cardiac muscle.[40] The non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is an injury to the cardiac muscle that results in an elevated troponin but lacks the ECG changes that define an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.[41] NSTEMIs usually represent less myocardial tissue damage than STEMIs, and an emergent coronary catheterization is not needed initially.[42] NSTEMIs are generally treated with medical management, including dual antiplatelet therapy and full anticoagulation, such as heparin.[43] NSTEMIs present a difficult challenge to the emergency provider. It is possible that a patient with chest pain can initially have a negative troponin with no ECG changes but can still have an NSTEMI because troponin levels do not start to rise until at least 2 to 3 hours after the initial insult.[44] This emphasizes the importance of getting serial troponins spaced 3 to 6 hours apart in patients suspected of having an ischemic event but with a troponin that is initially normal.[45] ## Testing Procedures Several assays for troponin are commercially available. A variety of quantitative and semiquantitative point-of-care methods have also been developed. Current assays for cTnT and cTnI are two- or three-site immunoassays.[23] All the assays are of the capture type, where an immobilized antibody specifically binds the troponin present in the serum or plasma. The captured troponin is then reacted with a second antibody and, in some assays, a third antibody coupled to an indicator
