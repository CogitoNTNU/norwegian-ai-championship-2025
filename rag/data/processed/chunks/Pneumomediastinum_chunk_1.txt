Bronchiectasis - Interstitial lung disease - Lung cancer - Foreign body in the airway - Increased intrathoracic pressure (e.g., forceful sneezing/inhalation)[4] - Childbirth - Excessive vomiting (i.e., Boerhaave syndrome, anorexia nervosa) - Excessive coughing (i.e., asthma exacerbation) - Strenuous physical activities **Iatrogenic Causes** - Endoscopy - Intubation - Central venous access procedures - Thoracostomy - Chest or abdominal surgeries **Traumatic Causes** - Blunt trauma - Penetrating trauma - Blast injuries[5] ## Epidemiology Pneumomediastinum is rare, with a reported prevalence as low as 0.002%.[2] Spontaneous pneumomediastinum most commonly presents in younger males of tall stature with low body mass index (76% of cases). One explanation for this predilection for younger adult patients is that mediastinal tissues in this population are less fibrotic compared to older patients and thus allow for easier air extravasation and subsequent spread. However, it is not well described in the pediatric literature except in neonates.[6] In patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, air leaks of any type excluding pneumothorax occurred in 3.7% of patients. In adult patients with blunt chest trauma, up to 10% had evidence of pneumomediastinum. ## Pathophysiology Spontaneous pneumomediastinum typically develops in a three-step process called the Macklin phenomenon:[7] 1. Increased intra-alveolar pressure results in alveolar rupture 1. Air dissects into peribronchial and perivascular sheaths 1. Air progressively spreads into the mediastinum and surrounding tissue Intra-alveolar pressure may increase from excessive vomiting or coughing, strenuous physical exertion, or Valsalva maneuvers (e.g., childbirth). Airway disease, such as asthma and COPD, causes bronchial constriction, which predisposes patients to airway injury due to baseline increased alveolar pressures. Forceful inhalation during illicit drug use may cause changes in intra-alveolar pressure or direct barotrauma, which similarly increases the risk for pneumomediastinum. Secondary pneumomediastinum is typically caused by trauma to the trachea or esophagus. Penetrating trauma (i.e., stab wounds) or blunt trauma (i.e., motor vehicle accident) may cause tracheal or esophageal injury. Though not well described, blasts may also cause secondary pneumomediastinum.[5] Iatrogenic trauma (e.g., endoscopy or endotracheal intubation) may result in similar injuries.[8] ## History and Physical In gathering the history, it is important to identify any existing risk factors for pneumomediastinum as well as preceding events. Key elements of the history include: - History of smoking or recreational drug use - History of airway or lung disease - History of excessive vomiting or coughing - Recent history of instrumentation - History of blunt or penetrating trauma The
