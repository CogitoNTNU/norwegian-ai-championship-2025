especially in cases with higher initial β-hCG levels. Generally, a 2-dose regimen may be preferred for medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy, especially in patients at high risk for treatment failure (eg, high β-hCG levels and large adnexal masses). The multidose regimen is less favored due a more complicated administration and follow-up protocol and a the higher risk of adverse effects. Some experts have suggested that multidose regimens may considered for ectopic pregnancy of advanced gestation or extratubal locations (eg, cervical or ovarian ectopic pregnancy).[14] Serum β-hCG levels are measured on days 4 and 7 after methotrexate administration. A decline of at least 15% between days 4 and 7 indicates effective treatment. If this reduction does not occur, additional methotrexate or surgical intervention may be required. Weekly monitoring continues until β-hCG is undetectable, which can take up to 8 weeks. Patients should be counseled about the risk of rupture until β-hCG reaches undetectable levels and be advised to seek emergency care if symptoms worsen.[1] Common adverse effects of methotrexate include gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), vaginal spotting, and transient hair loss. Patients should avoid folic acid supplements, NSAIDs, alcohol, narcotics, and activities that increase rupture risk (eg, vigorous exercise and intercourse). Methotrexate dermatitis can occur with sun exposure, and patients are advised to use contraception for at least 1 ovulatory cycle posttreatment, with some experts recommending a 3-month waiting period. Studies suggest methotrexate does not negatively affect future fertility.[6][1] **Surgical management** Surgical intervention provides a higher success rate than methotrexate. The decision to proceed with the surgery is guided by various factors, including elevated β-hCG levels (typically >5,000 mIU/mL), ultrasound findings indicating an embryo with cardiac activity, and social factors that may restrict follow-up access. When methotrexate is contraindicated, or not the preferred option, laparoscopic surgery is commonly performed.[6][1] Surgical options include salpingostomy and salpingectomy. Salpingectomy generally involves the partial or complete removal of the fallopian tube. Salpingostomy, also known as salpingotomy, entails removing the ectopic pregnancy through a tubal incision while keeping the fallopian tube intact. Both methods yield similar outcomes concerning future intrauterine pregnancy rates and the recurrence of ectopic pregnancies. The choice to remove or preserve the fallopian tube relies on intraoperative evaluation and the patient's fertility objectives. In instances of significant tubal damage, rupture, or previous tubal ligation, salpingectomy is the preferred approach. Patients with an intact contralateral fallopian tube experience comparable reproductive outcomes,
