patient with advanced dementia, smaller disturbances such as constipation, dehydration, sleep deprivation, urinary retention, or minor medical procedures can also precipitate delirium. The nature of delirium is transient but can persist in patients with predisposing factors. A systematic review showed that hospital delirium persisted until discharge in 45% of cases and persisted one month later in 33% of cases.[8] ## Epidemiology The prevalence of delirium is higher in the elderly population. It is a common surgical complication among older adults, with an incidence reported up to 10 to 20% after major elective surgery and up to 50% after high-risk procedures. Postoperative delirium is associated with a 7 to 10% increased risk of 30-day mortality and increases hospital stay by 2 to 3 days.[9] Delirium in the general population increases healthcare utilization and is associated with increased complications and poor outcomes. The total healthcare cost attributable to delirium is estimated at $164 billion annually. In patients presenting to the emergency department with delirium, there is a 70% increased risk of death at six months, and delirium in the ICU is associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased risk of overall mortality.[10] ## Pathophysiology There is no single mechanism to explain the etiology of delirium. It is a complicated and multifactorial process. Several hypotheses describe different aspects of the pathophysiology of delirium, and multiple processes are likely to occur simultaneously to create the delirium syndrome. **Increased Age** Changes associated with age lead to diminished physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to physical stress and illness. Some changes associated with age include decreased brain blood perfusion, increased neuron loss, and changes in the proportion of stress-regulating neurotransmitters. **Neuroinflammation** Peripheral inflammatory insults damage endothelial cell-cell adhesions at the blood-brain barrier. The increased endothelial permeability promotes inflammation in the central nervous system, causing further damage, ischemia, and neuronal death. **Reactive Oxidation Species** Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are mediators of cellular damage. The central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to reactive oxygen species due to its high lipid content and low antioxidant capacity. **Circadian Rhythm Dysregulation** Disruption in sleep duration and architecture and melatonin secretion leads to dysfunction of many systems. Melatonin affects many functions in the central nervous system, including regulation of sleep-wake cycles, glucose regulation, core body temperature, antioxidant defenses, and immune system response. **Neurotransmitter Imbalance** Delirium is associated with decreased acetylcholine and increased dopamine activity.
