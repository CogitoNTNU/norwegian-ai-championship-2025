waveform ceases as soon as apnea occurs. Additionally, in cases of deep sedation where there is an increased risk of airway obstruction, CO2 monitoring provides early detection of airway obstruction.[16] In conclusion, pulse oximetry and capnography individually offer two useful non-invasive techniques to facilitate respiratory monitoring in clinical settings. A proper grasp of the benefits and limitations of each of the techniques can significantly aid in patient management and safety.[17] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Pulse oximetry and capnography can help elucidate underlying pathology and help the medical team provide appropriate care without invasive monitoring. Understanding the indications and limitations of these techniques can help the medical team improve patient care and outcomes. The nursing staff is an essential contributor to the management of patients using these techniques. The critical care and emergency specialized nurse can help assist the medical team make the correct diagnosis, verify correct endotracheal intubation, and assure the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation using these techniques. The respiratory therapist can assist the medical team achieve adequate mechanical ventilation in patients using capnography and pulse oximetry waveforms. A collaborative interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists can help assure appropriate and judicious use of capnography and pulse oximetry to provide optimal medical care.
