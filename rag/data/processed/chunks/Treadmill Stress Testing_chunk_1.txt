the increase in myocardial oxygen demand and coronary vasodilation allows for increased oxygen delivery which is crucial to myocardial perfusion, thereby preventing ischemia. Through this hyperemic effect, providers can identify ischemia, as stenotic vessels do not vasodilate as well as normal vessels.[4] Due to sympathetic stimulation and vagal inhibition, an increase in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output is noted. Alveolar ventilation and venous return also increase as a consequence of selective vasoconstriction. The hemodynamic response depends on the amount of muscle mass involved, exercise intensity, and overall conditioning. As exercise progresses, skeletal muscle blood flow increase and peripheral resistance decrease leading to a rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure.[5] Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) may remain unchanged, slightly increase, or slightly decrease. The age-predicted maximum heart rate is a useful measure for estimating the adequacy of stress on the heart to induce ischemia. The goal is usually 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate, calculated by subtracting the patient's age from 220.[6][7][8] ## Indications Treadmill stress testing is indicated for the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). This is the initial investigation of choice in patients with a normal or near-normal resting ECG capable of performing adequate exercise.[9][1] Indications for treadmill testing include: - Symptoms suggesting myocardial ischemia - Acute chest pain in patients excluded for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - Recent ACS treated without coronary angiography or incomplete revascularization - Known CAD with worsening symptoms - Prior coronary revascularization (5 years or longer after coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] or two years or less after percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) - Valvular heart disease (to assess exercise capacity and need for surgical intervention) - Certain cardiac arrhythmias to assess chronotropic competence - Newly diagnosed heart failure or cardiomyopathy[1][8] ## Contraindications **Absolute Contraindications** - Acute myocardial infarction within 2 to 3 days - Unstable angina not previously stabilized by medical therapy - Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise[10] - Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis[11] - Uncontrolled symptomatic heart failure - An acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction - Severe pulmonary hypertension - Acute myocarditis or pericarditis, or endocarditis - Acute aortic dissection **Relative Contraindications (can be overlooked if the benefits of treadmill stress testing outweigh the risks)** - High-grade AV blocks - Severe hypertension (systolic greater than 200 mmHg, diastolic greater than 110 mmHg, or both) - Inability to exercise
