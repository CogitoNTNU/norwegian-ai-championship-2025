is disrupted autonomic function after a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which can cause an increased catecholamine response that acts on the cardiac myocytes.[69] Another issue that complicates the measurement of troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarctions is chronic kidney disease (CKD).[70] Patients with CKD have been shown to have elevated troponin levels greater than the 99th percentile with no evidence of cardiac disease. Although the mechanism for increased troponins is not completely understood, it is thought to be due to underlying structural abnormalities of the cardiac tissue and chronic myocardial injury.[71] Studies have also suggested that the kidneys have some role in clearing troponin from circulation, although there is no evidence of troponin in urine. This can complicate the diagnosis of a CKD patient who presents to the emergency department complaining of chest pain with an elevated troponin.[72] A meta-analysis of 14 studies showed that the specificity of an elevated troponin over the 99th percentile was drastically decreased in patients with CKD. It is crucial to know if the troponins are trending over time in these patients.[73] The troponin levels in patients with CKD are usually steady, so a rise and fall of the troponin would be more indicative of a cardiac cause of the elevated troponin.[70] One accepted recommendation is if there is a change in the troponin level of 20% during serial testing, it is likely due to a cardiac cause; the research for this recommendation is lacking.[74] Reports indicate that hemolysis can interfere with some troponin immunoassay procedures, and false-positive and false-negative results have been reported.[75] Troponin bound to heparin causes lower measured troponin plasma concentration compared to serum.[76] Other sources of interference that may affect the assay detection process and cause false-negative troponin values include ascorbic acid in immunoenzymometric assays using alkaline phosphatase, biotin in assays using a biotinylated antibody, streptokinase in the presence of streptavidin, and high titers of antibodies to ruthenium or streptavidin in cTnT assays.[77] Interference is method dependent and may vary for each commercially available assay.[78] Diagnostic manufacturers specify in their package inserts upper limits above which interference due to hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia, among others, may occur.[79] The specificity of the antibody is critical. One of the possible sources of interference for the sandwich-type immunometric troponin assays is endogenous antibodies directed against the proteins of nonhuman species (i.e., heterophile antibodies).[80] Heterophile antibodies consist of natural antibodies and autoantibodies that are
