not shown consistent clinical benefit in patients with aspiration-associated pleuropulmonary disease. According to current recommendations, glucocorticoid therapy does not manage aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.[6][8] The British Thoracic Society offers similar recommendations for managing aspiration pneumonia, emphasizing the polymicrobial nature of aspiration pneumonia and the necessity for broader-spectrum antibiotics for effective treatment. However, citing ecological concerns associated with the use of cephalosporins, the British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest initiating therapy with amoxicillin for most patients with aspiration pneumonia. In cases of penicillin allergy, alternatives such as respiratory fluoroquinolone, a macrolide, or a tetracycline may be considered.[1] Adequate oxygenation is another essential component of treatment in patients with treatment in patients with aspiration pneumonia. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend maintaining a 94% to 98% target oxygen saturation for most patients. In acutely ill patients with a higher disease severity, oxygen saturation of 94% to 96% may be optimal. However, exceptions should be made for patients at risk for hypercapnia due to underlying comorbidities, with a target oxygenation range between 88% and 92% as clinically appropriate.[1] ## Differential Diagnosis In the differential diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, several conditions warrant consideration, and it is crucial to differentiate aspiration pneumonia from these entities:[4] - Aspiration pneumonitis - CAP - Acute respiratory distress syndrome - Viral Pneumonia - Negative-pressure pulmonary edema: Presents with bilateral symmetric lung infiltrates and occurs due to breathing against a closed airway. It can happen during events such as general anesthesia, choking, or near drowning.[6] ## Prognosis Patients with CAP who have an increased aspiration risk are noted to have higher in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Aspiration risk also increases recurrent pneumonia risk and all-cause readmission rates. Aspiration pneumonia is identified as an independent risk factor for these outcomes, although the lack of robust data prevents specific predictions relating to aspiration pneumonia.[9] Older adults aged over 80 with pneumonia and those with aspiration pneumonia exhibited higher mortality rates, elevated sodium levels, and poorer renal function compared to age-matched controls with pneumonia but without evidence of aspiration.[6] In the US, aspiration pneumonia caused an average of 58,576 deaths per year between 1999 and 2017, with individuals aged 75 or older accounting for 76% of deaths attributable to aspiration pneumonia.[10] Among hospitalized patients with aspiration pneumonia, the mortality rate is approximately 10% to 15%, with the highest risk of poor outcomes observed in patients with older age.
