cell morphology and exclude other contributing factors, as mentioned above.[4][13][14] **White Blood Cell Tests** **White blood cell count** WBC, or the absolute WBC, is the number of white blood cells present per blood microliter (μL). The normal reference interval in adults is usually 4500 to 11000 cells/μL. Leukopenia is defined as a low WBC and may be due to reduced production, increased utilization, or increased destruction of white blood cells. A spurious leukopenia may occur due to white blood cell clumping. An elevated white blood cell count is called leukocytosis and may be caused by an inflammatory stressor or myeloproliferative pathology. A spurious leucocytosis may occur in the setting of: - Reticulocytosis, where nucleated red blood cells are counted as white blood cells - Platelet clumping, where aggregate platelets are counted as white blood cells - Fibrin clumps - Cryoproteinemia Identification of a WBC abnormality is followed by an assessment of the white cell differential to identify which white blood cell types are affected. The differential may be reported as a percentage of the total WBC or as an absolute count for each mature white cell type.[15] **Neutrophil count** The neutrophil count is the number of neutrophils per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or, as an absolute number, absolute neutrophil count. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 40% to 60% of the absolute WBC or 1500 to 8000 cells/µL. Neutrophilia, which refers to an increase in the neutrophil count, can be due to infection, trauma, tissue necrosis, physical or emotional stress, smoking, myeloproliferative disease, chronic inflammatory disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), vasculitides, chronic hepatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute gout, congenital conditions (such as Down syndrome and hereditary idiopathic neutrophilia), blood loss, hemolytic anemia, obesity, pregnancy, or medications. Neutropenia, which refers to a decrease in the neutrophil count, can be due to bone marrow failure (due to myeloproliferative diseases, lymphoproliferative disease, metastatic malignancy, myelodysplasia or irradiation), megaloblastic anemia, hereditary, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), hypersplenism, hemodialysis, viral infection (such as cytomegalovirus, measles, rubella, human immunodeficiency virus, Dengue fever, infectious mononucleosis), bacterial infections (such as typhoid fever or septicemia), protozoal infections, idiopathic, or drug-induced. **Lymphocyte count** The lymphocyte count is the number of lymphocytes per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number.
