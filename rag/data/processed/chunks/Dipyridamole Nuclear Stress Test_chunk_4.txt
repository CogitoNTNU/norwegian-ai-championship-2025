suggest monitoring the patients for toxicity while undergoing perfusion testing with particular attention for signs of hypoperfusion, including extremity cyanosis, pallor, or decreased temperature.[17] In addition to the physical manifestations, vigilance for the changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or respiration should occur while using dipyridamole for pharmacologic stress testing.[16][18] **Pharmacokinetic Parameters** - Half-life elimination: 10 to 12 hours - Peak time: 2 to 2.5 hours - Onset: 24 minutes - Duration: 3 hours - Protein-bound: 91 to 99% - Vd: 2 to 3 L/kg - Clearance: 2.3 to 3.5 mL/min/kg - Excretion: Fecal excretion - Metabolism: Liver - Dialyzable: not-dialyzable ## Toxicity To reverse any complications and side effects of dipyridamole, aminophylline (50 to 250 mg IV push over 30 to 60 seconds given no sooner than 1 minute after the radiotracer injection) should be on hand for urgent/emergent use.[18] This use is particularly used in the setting of adverse effects while undergoing pharmacologic stress testing. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes When using dipyridamole in the setting of pharmacologic stress testing, it is essential to actively look out for the clinical findings associated with an adverse pharmacologic stress test. As outlined above, monitoring for hypoperfusion while undergoing diagnostic testing is imperative to assist in preventing adverse events. It is essential that the entire interprofessional stress-testing team is aware of and actively evaluate the signs of hypoperfusion. The entire team, including the ultrasound technician, nursing team, cardiologist, and any other assistants involved in administering the stress test, understand the signs and symptoms of toxicity. A pharmacist should also review the patient's medication profile to ensure no drug-drug interactions and alert the team of any findings that may raise concerns. In addition to the importance of active monitoring, having the appropriate resources to reverse induced hypoperfusion is also essential to deter sequela. Maintaining an adequate stock solution of aminophylline with suitable syringes is important to allow for time-sensitive reversal when appropriate and necessary.[18] Interprofessional coordination will drive better patient results with minimal adverse events.
