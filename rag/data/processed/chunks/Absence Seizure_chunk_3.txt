times throughout the day. Most children stop their activity completely, but some can continue it more slowly or unusually.[1] Some children have 3-Hz regular eyelid fluttering.[1][2] Clinical presentation can also vary in the same individual.[7] Oral automatisms can also occur, especially with prolonged seizures or during hyperventilation. Children frequently have mild clonic or tonic movements in the first few seconds of the spell. Pallor is commonly reported.[1] Urinary incontinence is rare. Spells usually last between 4 and 30 seconds. Hyperventilation, a state of arousal, sleep deprivation, and medication use can affect the duration of the seizure.[1] These seizures are not preceded by an aura and do not have a postictal state.[13] On physical examination, hyperventilation can trigger absence seizures. To test this, the examiner asks the child to blow repetitively for at least 2 minutes. Using a pinwheel or paper can be helpful because this encourages the child to cooperate more during testing. If hyperventilation is done successfully, the patient may develop seizures that can be seen clinically or on EEG. There is some evidence that absence seizures are more easily provoked when the person is in a sitting position.[15] For JAE, the age of onset is classically between 10 and 19 years, with a peak at 15 years.[4] Seizures are less frequent than in CAE but tend to last longer.[3][4] Absence status consists of generalized, nonconvulsive seizures characterized by impairment of awareness and intermittently has other manifestations such as automatisms or subtle myoclonic, tonic, atonic, or autonomic phenomena. Patients usually have a previous diagnosis of generalized epilepsy. Absence status presents as a nonconvulsive seizure lasting between a half hour and several days. It usually ends spontaneously and suddenly but should be treated with antiseizure medications at the time of diagnosis.[16] ## Evaluation EEG is the main diagnostic tool for the evaluation of absence epilepsy. In the case of childhood absence seizures, EEG shows bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3-Hz spike and wave discharges that start and end abruptly (see **Image.** EEG Showing the Characteristic 3-Hz Spike and Wave Discharges Seen in Absence Epilepsy). These discharges sometimes have maximum frontal amplitude or begin with unilateral focal spikes.[2] In 50% of seizures in CAE, the initial discharge seen has a typical spike and wave morphology. The remaining 50% can show a single spike, polyspikes, or an atypical, irregular, generalized spike and wave on a normal background.[1][4] Atypical absence seizures show a more
