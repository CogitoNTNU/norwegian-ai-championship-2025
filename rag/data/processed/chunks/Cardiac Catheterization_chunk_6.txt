kidney injury was 7.1% among the patients undergoing elective and urgent coronary intervention.[8] The risk is higher in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal disease, people with diabetes, elderly, females, patients on diuretics, ACEI, and metformin. Adequate pre-hydration, use of iso-osmolar agents, and techniques to minimize the amount of dye used will help prevent this complication. Renal atheroemboli can also cause renal failure and are associated with other signs of embolization. \*\*_Infection_ \*\* Cardiac catheterization is performed using sterile technique, and local or systemic infection is extremely rare. Routine prophylaxis for endocarditis is not recommended during cardiac catheterization procedures. \*\*_Radiation Injury_ \*\* Radiation skin injury can occur if a patient is exposed to excessive doses of radiation to one particular area of the body, and manifestation could range from mild erythema to deep ulceration. Skin biopsies should be avoided for these lesions as they would make the underlying condition worse. This complication should be managed by a combined team of cardiologists, dermatologists, and plastic surgeons. \*\*_Arrhythmias_ \*\* The occurrence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia during the procedure could be related to irritation or ischemia of the myocardium by the catheter, contrast material, or occlusive balloons. These arrhythmias occur more frequently in people presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Treatment includes cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs and restoration of the flow to the occluded artery. Atrial tachyarrhythmias can occur following the irritation of the right atrium during right heart catheterization and is usually self-limiting. Transient bradyarrhythmias are also a common occurrence in the cardiac cath lab. Prolonged episodes resulting in hypotension will need treatment with intravenous atropine or temporary transvenous pacing. In people with preexisting right bundle branch block, development of the left bundle branch block during right heart catheterization may result in complete heart block. This can be avoided by minimal catheter manipulation in the right ventricular outflow tract. ## Clinical Significance With the advent of the small catheters, increased use of the transradial approach, and improving technical skills of the operators, the risks and complications associated with cardiac catheterization have decreased significantly. Utmost care is necessary with each procedure to decrease the risk of complications of this commonly used life-saving procedure. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Cardiac catheterization is usually done by an interprofessional cardiac care team that includes an interventional cardiologist with assistance from nurses and radiologic technologists. During the procedure, a nurse is dedicated to the
