intraosseously, or endotracheally via an endotracheal tube. Data show that the intranasal route is as effective as the intramuscular route in the prehospital setting. However, naloxone may cause agitation and aggression when it reverses the opioid effects. The lowest naloxone dose necessary to reverse respiratory apnea should be administered in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Patients may become combative or violent in the ambulance, and restraints may be needed for the safety of both the patient and EMS personnel. If the patient remains unresponsive to naloxone, endotracheal intubation should be considered to protect the airway. **Emergency Department Care** Immediate assessment of the patient's airway and hemodynamics should be given priority upon evaluation in the emergency department. Additional information from EMS personnel should include the presence of any drugs or paraphernalia, the patient's initial presentation (including vital signs), any potential trauma, and details regarding the timing and specifics of the suspected overdose. EMS personnel at the scene may have already secured the airway by administering naloxone or performing endotracheal intubation in some cases. Emergency physicians should evaluate the patient's airway and breathing upon arrival and determine if further intervention is necessary. Immobilization should be prioritized if suspicion of occult trauma to the cervical spine arises. A capillary blood glucose level should be checked in any patient presenting with an unknown cause of lethargy or loss of consciousness, even if an overdose is highly suspected. Initial treatment of overdose starts with supportive care, including assistance with respiration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the absence of spontaneous circulation, and removal of any opioid agent, such as a patch or infusion. Naloxone should be administered immediately when an opioid overdose is suspected as the cause of respiratory and CNS depression, without delay for laboratory studies. **Naloxone administration** Naloxone is a pure competitive antagonist of opiate receptors and has no agonistic activity. The drug is relatively safe and may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or endotracheally, though research on tracheal absorption has been conducted only in animal models. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an intranasal formulation commonly used by first responders in patients without intravenous access. Intranasal naloxone is also available to the community.[31] After naloxone administration, the onset of action occurs within minutes, regardless of the route. A second dose may be given every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed by 3 to
