Last Update: October 3, 2022. ## Introduction The mediastinum is a complex anatomic space within the central thoracic cavity, surrounded by the lungs. It extends from the thoracic inlet superiorly to the diaphragm inferiorly. The mediastinum contains multiple vital organs and anatomical structures. Understanding anatomy helps narrow the differential while evaluating mediastinal masses, which helps recommend the right imaging modality. Mediastinal pathology ranges from congenital abnormalities and vascular, traumatic, and infective etiologies to benign and malignant neoplasms. While computed tomography (CT) is considered the imaging modality of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), and ultrasonography are also helpful in narrowing the differential. Chest radiography is the most common initial imaging modality for evaluating the mediastinum. ## Anatomy There are multiple classification systems for dividing the mediastinum into various compartments, which radiologists, surgeons, and anatomists use. While clinically, the Shield system is the most popular; the Felson classification is more common among radiologists.[1] According to the Felson classification, the mediastinum is classified into anterior, middle, and posterior compartments. A line drawn from the anterior tracheal wall to the posterior inferior vena cava on a lateral chest radiograph separates the anterior mediastinum from the middle mediastinum. The middle and posterior mediastinal compartments are separated by drawing another line passing 1 cm posterior to the anterior margin of the vertebral bodies. The newer classification systems include the ITMIG (International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group) classification of mediastinal compartments, which allows boundaries based on anatomic structures that can be seen on cross-sectional imaging.[1] This classification is more inclusive and divides the mediastinum into: 1. Prevascular or the anterior compartment 1. Visceral or the middle compartment 1. Paravertebral or the posterior compartment. **Anterior Compartment** This extends from the posterior surface of the sternum to the anterior aspect of the great vessels and pericardium. Its contents include lymph nodes, fat, thymus, and internal mammary arteries. Approximately 50% of all mediastinal masses are located in the anterior mediastinum. Most common masses include thymic tumors, lymphoma, thyroid tumors, and tumors arising from the germ cell rests, such as teratomas. Thyroid tumors are usually a substernal extension of masses arising from the thyroid gland in the neck. **Middle Compartment** This extends from the pericardium to the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine. Its contents include the heart, pericardium, aorta
