This activity outlines the etiology, evaluation, and medical treatment of infective endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the etiologic pathogens commonly associated with infective endocarditis. - Outline the common signs and symptoms associated with infective endocarditis. - Summarize the management of infective endocarditis based on pathogen susceptibility. - Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.

Changes in the host include older and sicker patients who carry a high burden of comorbidities. Resistance to antibiotics is another challenge threatening healthcare worldwide and seems to be growing. Despite technological advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the overall mortality has not improved. Aortic valve infective endocarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of infective endocarditis with a particular emphasis on aortic valve endocarditis. The term native valve endocarditis denotes a cardiac infection that involves the leaflets of the valves, the endocardial surface, chordae tendinae, congenital defects, and anastomosis sites. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined by an infection involving artificial valves, conduits, catheters, assist devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, or other artificial intracardiac structures. ## Etiology The
