response is particularly beneficial for identifying retrocochlear pathology and assessing symptoms related to eighth nerve disorders. The application of this test is most valuable when comparing auditory brainstem response results to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) in patients who have experienced significant auditory trauma. ## Treatment / Management Despite promising outcomes, conflicting evidence exists regarding a definitive treatment protocol for patients with AAT. The JTS Practice Guidelines prioritize primary prevention over treatment, recommending that individuals at risk be educated on the importance of using ear protection and minimizing noise exposure. Emphasis is also placed on educating individuals to recognize AAT symptoms and the importance of self-reporting for evaluation.[25] The treatment of patients with AAT can vary based on several factors, and it is essential for each patient to understand that no treatment guarantees complete restoration of hearing. If there is visible trauma from a blast injury to the outer ear, ear canal, tympanic membrane, or middle ear, addressing these issues should be the priority. In such instances, the management approach may involve staged healing and potential surgical repair as needed, with the acknowledgment that some degree of hearing loss may still occur. If the hearing loss is purely sensorineural and no other otologic or brain trauma is evident, several treatment strategies are available, as described below. **Corticosteroids:** These may be effective whether administered intravenously, orally, or intratympanically.[61][62][63][64][65] - Intravenous corticosteroids: These regimens may include methylprednisolone at 125 mg on the first day of treatment, 80 mg on the second day, and 40 mg on the final day.[64] - Oral prednisone: This drug may be administered at a dosage of 1 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 60 mg daily, for 1 to 2 weeks. Longer courses often yield better outcomes in patients who can tolerate high-dose steroids for more than 1 week.[65][61] - Steroid injections: The JTS guideline recommends high-dose oral or transtympanic steroid injections, when not contraindicated, for patients with threshold shifts of more than 25 dB in 3 consecutive frequencies. The injection regimen typically includes transtympanic dexamethasone at a concentration of 24 mg/mL. Patients should undergo weekly audiometric evaluations, regardless of the treatment approach. If follow-up audiograms indicate some recovery, additional injections are recommended, up to a total of 3.[25] **Antioxidants and neurotrophins:** These may provide benefits in the acute treatment of NIHL.[66] Although the evidence supporting the use of antioxidants and neurotrophins is limited,
