magnesium sulfate has also been shown to increase lung function and decrease hospitalization in children - Administering systemic corticosteroids within one hour of an emergency room or urgent care presentation has a significant effect on patients with severe exacerbation and also decreases hospitalization - Patients should be sent home on oral prednisone after an acute hospitalization [4] ## Differential Diagnosis Making sure a patient has asthma and not another condition is an essential step before initiating treatment. **Adults** - Chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) - Congestive heart failure - gastroesophageal reflux disease - mechanical obstruction of airways - vocal cord dysfunction - Obstructive sleep apnea - Depression and stress \_**Infrequent Causes** \_ - Pulmonary embolism - pulmonary infiltrates - Medications such as ACE inhibitors **Children** In children distinguishing between asthma wheezing versus others, causes can be difficult. The differential in children for wheezing can be the following: \_**Upper Airway Diseases** \_ - Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis \_**Obstructions Involving Large Airways** \_ - Foreign body in trachea or bronchus - Vocal cord dysfunction - Vascular rings or laryngeal webs - Laryngotracheomalcia, tracheal stenosis, or bronchostenosis - Enlarged lymph node or tumor \_**Obstructions Involving Small Airways** \_ - Viral bronchiolitis - Cystic Fibrosis - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia - Primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome \_**Other Causes** \_ - Congenital heart disease - A recurrent cough not due to asthma - Aspiration - Gastroesophageal reflux ## Staging See [Table 1](https://www.statpearls.com/pictures/getimagecontent/6730) ## Prognosis The prognosis of asthma is variable amongst adults and children. Children do experience complete resolution more than adults. However, the progression of severe disease is unlikely in both groups unless there are other underlying lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or tobacco abuse. Many studies have shown those patients that have had previous hospitalizations, as well as intubations who are classified as severe asthmatics, have a poorer prognosis. Patients who smoke and have underlying COPD have a poorer prognosis as well in this subset of patients permanent lung impairment can occur. Many recent studies have shown if inhaled steroids are started early in the course of the disease as well as continuously has a beneficial effect and can improve lung function.
