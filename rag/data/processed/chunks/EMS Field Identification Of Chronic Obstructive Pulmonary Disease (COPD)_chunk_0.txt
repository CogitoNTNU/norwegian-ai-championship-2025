It is a common cause of death worldwide. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be diagnosed and treated promptly. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). - Recall, analyze, and select appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). - Explain the treatment and management options available for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). - Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and improve outcomes.

It is associated with structural lung changes due to chronic inflammation from prolonged exposure to noxious particles or gases most commonly cigarette smoke. Chronic inflammation causes airway narrowing and decreased lung recoil. The disease often presents with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum production. Symptoms can range from being asymptomatic to respiratory failure. [1] ## Etiology COPD is caused by prolonged exposure to harmful particles or gases. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD worldwide. Other causes may include second-hand smoke, environmental and occupational exposures, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). [1] ## Epidemiology COPD is primarily present in smokers and those greater than age 40. Prevalence increases with age and it is currently the third most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2015, the prevalence of COPD was 174 million and there were approximately 3.2 million deaths due to COPD worldwide. However, the prevalence is likely to be underestimated due to the underdiagnosis of COPD. [1][2] ## Pathophysiology COPD is an inflammatory condition
