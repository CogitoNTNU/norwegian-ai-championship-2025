is the most widely used alternative but is associated with an increased risk of SCD due to decreasing defibrillation threshold. Patients on beta-blockers reported having lower mortality rates. For primary prevention of SCD in patients from the high-risk group, as well as for secondary prevention in patients who already have a prior history of sustained VT or VF, ICD implantation is recommended.[15][16] Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) have benefits in terms of mortality and survival rates compared to medical treatment. ## Differential Diagnosis The following signs speak in favor of ventricular tachycardia: QRS complex greater than 0.14 seconds with right bundle branch morphology or greater than 0.16 seconds with left bundle branch morphology, RS interval > 100 ms in a precordial lead, AV dissociation, negative QRS concordance in the precordial leads and ventricular fusion beats.[12] If the patientâ€™s condition allows, differential diagnosis of a wide-complex tachycardia should be made between ventricular tachycardia (80% of wide-QRS tachycardia cases), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction (15% to 20%) and SVT with pre-excitation and antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) (1% to 5%).[16] Every wide complex tachycardia should be considered as VT until proven otherwise.[17][18] ## Prognosis Prognosis of pulseless ventricular tachycardia heavily depends on the time from the onset of tachycardia to defibrillation and restoration of sinus rhythm and efficient perfusion. Shorter delays in defibrillation associated with higher survival rates, up to 50%. Delays in treatment up to 15 minutes decrease the survival rates to as low as 5%.[18] The prognosis also depends on a patient's cardiac status, including underlying ischemic or structural heart disease, as well as other comorbidities. ## Complications Pusless ventricular tachycardia can lead to cardiac arrest and insufficient organ perfusion, which is the main cause of most complications. Anoxic brain injury and lifelong neurological complications can result from tachycardia that lasts for greater than 3 minutes.[19] Anoxic brain injury is one of the multiple pathophysiological conditions that can occur in post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Other complications of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome include post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction and systemic ischemia/reperfusion response. Myocardial dysfunction from ischemia can lead to transient global dysfunction and is a common cause of early mortality after cardiac arrest.[20] Reperfusion after ischemia causes activation of immunologic and coagulation pathways, which increases the risk of multiple organ failure and infections. The ischemic-reperfusion injury also depletes intravascular volume and impairs vasoregulation and oxygen delivery to organ tissues.[20] Treatment for post-cardiac arrest
