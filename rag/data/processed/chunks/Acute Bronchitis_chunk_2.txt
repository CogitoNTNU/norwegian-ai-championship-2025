This case surge aligns with increased outdoor activities, providing more significant opportunities for viral transmission. Vaccination status, particularly against viruses like influenza, can influence the etiology of acute bronchitis. A study conducted in France revealed that among 164 cases of acute bronchitis in adults who have received influenza vaccination, 37% were found to have a viral origin. Within the identified viral causes, 21% of cases were attributed to rhinovirus. This underscores that despite being vaccinated against influenza, individuals may remain susceptible to rhinovirus infections, which can manifest as bronchitis symptoms.[11] Exposure to irritants such as smoke, contaminated air, dust, and other environmental pollutants can also cause acute bronchitis or exacerbate preexisting respiratory conditions. Furthermore, allergens can trigger an allergic response within the airways, ultimately culminating in inflammation and the onset of bronchitis symptoms, particularly in individuals who are susceptible to such triggers.[12] ## Epidemiology Acute bronchitis represents a common clinical presentation across various healthcare settings. In the United States, approximately 5% of individuals annually report physician-diagnosed cases of acute bronchitis. The numbers tend to peak during winter, aligning with the seasonal prevalence of respiratory viral infections like influenza and RSV, which often coincide with flu season.[13][14] Similarly, a study conducted in the United Kingdom reported similar rates of acute bronchitis, with an incidence of 54 cases per 1000 persons. Notably, these rates exhibit variability among different age groups, with lower rates among younger men (36 per 1000) and higher rates in individuals older than 85 (225 per 1000).[8] These discrepancies in incidence may be attributed to variations in healthcare-seeking behavior, age-related immune responses, and exposure to viral pathogens in different settings. In addition, several risk factors contribute to the development of acute bronchitis, including a history of smoking, residence in polluted areas, crowded living conditions, and a prior history of asthma. Specific allergens such as pollen, perfume, and vapors can potentially trigger acute bronchitis in susceptible individuals. In instances where the infection is of bacterial origin, the isolated pathogens tend to overlap with those commonly associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Examples of such pathogens are _Streptococcus_ _pneumonia_ and _Staphylococcus_ _aureus_.[15][16] ## Pathophysiology Acute bronchitis is inflammation affecting the large and mid-sized airways (bronchi), frequently precipitated by viral infections. The wide array of anatomical sites within the respiratory tract where these pathogens can take hold underscores the diverse impact of these microorganisms on the respiratory tract.
