cardiac disease but also provides useful information to guide therapy. **Transesophageal echocardiography** : an invasive test in which transthoracic echo is inconclusive or needs further information on infectious endocarditis. The esophagus's proximity to the heart and absence of intervening structures such as the lung make the Transesophageal echo ideal for examining various important structures. **Stress echocardiography** : including imaging in routine stress testing increases the sensitivity and specificity of the test in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography post-myocardial infarction helps in risk stratification, location, and extent of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography can also be used to risk-stratify patients before non-cardiac surgery, as resting echo does not provide essential prognostic information. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes To perform echocardiography requires an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist and an echo technician. It is vital to take a proper history and perform a pre-procedure physical examination to determine the indication of the procedure. Communication between echo technicians and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in results. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=129469&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=129469) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/ultrasound-adult-echocardiography-assessment-protocols-and-interpretation-echocardiography/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=129469) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/129469/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=129469) [![Parasternal Long-Axis View on Transthoracic Echocardiography](/books/NBK570556/bin/PLAX__view.gif)](/books/NBK570556/figure/article-129469.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK570556/figure/article-129469.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Parasternal Long-Axis View on Transthoracic Echocardiography.
