HF) HF include: - In patients with hypertension, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be used for the management of hypertension. - In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors are indicated to reduce HF hospitalizations. - Lifestyle modifications, including healthy eating, physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and avoidance of smoking, are indicated. - Prognostication scores are recommended for patients with HF to estimate the risk of future HF events.[45] Examples include the Framingham Heart Failure Risk Score (1999), Health ABC Heart Failure Score (2008), ARIC Risk Score (2012), and PCP-HF score (2019). - Optimal management of cardiovascular diseases in patients known to have CAD should be implemented. - Patients at risk for HF due to exposure to cardiotoxic medications (eg, chemotherapy) should be managed with an interprofessional approach. - Natriuretic peptide screening and periodic evaluation should be performed. **Stage B Heart Failure Management** Management of Stage B (pre-HF) is focused on preventing clinical HF and reducing mortality and adverse cardiovascular events, including: - For patients with LVEF ≤40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent clinical HF and for mortality reduction. - For patients with LVEF ≤40% and evidence of prior or recent acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, the use of a statin and beta-blocker is recommended for reduction of mortality, CHF, and adverse cardiovascular events. - For patients with LVEF ≤30% and receiving optimal medical therapy, with NYHA-class I and an expectation of meaningful survival of more than 1 year, a primary prevention ICD is recommended. - Beta-blockers are recommended for patients with LVEF ≤40%, irrespective of the etiology, to prevent symptomatic HF. - For patients with LVEF ≤50%, the use of thiazolidinediones and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers increases the risk of adverse outcomes and HF hospitalizations, so they should be avoided. - Valve repair, replacement, or interventions have associated guidelines for asymptomatic valvular heart disease. - Patients with congenital heart disease also have associated guidelines. **Stage C Heart Failure Management** The recommended treatment for stage C (HF) includes: - Interprofessional management is indicated for improving self-care and mortality of patients with HF. - Patient education and social support are required for optimal management. - Vaccination against respiratory illnesses is effective in reducing mortality. - Screening patients for frailty, depression, low literacy, low social support, and resource and transport logistics during healthcare encounters is reasonable. - A low-sodium diet is recommended. - Exercise training is
