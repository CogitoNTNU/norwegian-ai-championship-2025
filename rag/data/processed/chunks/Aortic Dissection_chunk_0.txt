Early recognition, prompt imaging, and appropriate surgical or medical management are crucial for survival. Management involves a multifaceted approach, including blood pressure control, pain management, and potential surgical intervention, depending on the type and location of the dissection. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for complications like redissection, aneurysm formation, and cardiovascular events. Clinicians participating in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of aortic dissection and insights into recent advancements in treatment modalities and patient care strategies. The course enhances clinicians' ability to identify high-risk patients, interpret imaging findings, and apply evidence-based therapeutic interventions. Participants will also learn about the importance of interprofessional collaboration and effective communication that improves patient outcomes and ensures patient safety in complex cases. **Objectives:** - Identify the clinical signs and symptoms of aortic dissection to ensure timely recognition in patients presenting with chest pain. - Differentiate between aortic dissection and other potential causes of acute chest pain, such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. - Select the most effective pharmacologic interventions to manage blood pressure and heart rate in patients with aortic dissection. - Collaborate with surgical and medical teams to develop a comprehensive management plan for patients diagnosed with aortic dissection.

Blood enters between the intima and media, propagating the dissection either proximally or retrograde, resulting in compromised blood flow to vital organs. Acute aortic dissection carries extremely high mortality rates, with many patients dying before reaching emergency care. Patients with chronic aortic dissection, defined as a dissection present for
