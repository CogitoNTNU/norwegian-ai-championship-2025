reveals transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness in approximately 40% of patients with diagnosed acute bronchitis. A reported 17% of these patients exhibit reversibility of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) greater than 15%.[14] Airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness typically resolve within 6 weeks.[24] ## Treatment / Management Acute bronchitis is typically a self-limiting condition, and its treatment primarily revolves around providing symptomatic and supportive therapy. For alleviating cough, both nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches can be considered. Nonpharmacological strategies include remedies such as hot tea, honey, ginger, and throat lozenges. Notably, the efficacy of these interventions has not been evaluated through clinical trials. In clinical practice, antitussive agents like dextromethorphan (with or without codeine) are often used to suppress cough based on their effectiveness in managing chronic bronchitis symptoms and data from studies on cough associated with the common cold. No randomized trials specifically assess the efficacy in antitussive agents in acute bronchitis. Codeine usage should be avoided due to its addictive potential. The available data regarding the use of mucolytic agents in acute bronchitis treatment are conflicting and lack a clear consensus on efficacy. Therefore, these agents' role in managing acute bronchitis remains a subject of ongoing investigation and debate. Beta-agonists are commonly administered to patients with acute bronchitis who exhibit wheezing. However, the findings from small randomized control trials investigating the use of beta-agonists for cough in acute bronchitis have yielded mixed results. In a Cochrane review encompassing 5 trials, no substantial benefit of beta-agonists on daily cough was observed, except for a minor advantage in a subgroup of patients with wheezing and airflow obstruction at baseline.[25] A more recent Cochrane review reported similar outcomes.[26] Analgesic and antipyretic agents may manage associated symptoms like malaise, myalgia, and fever. Additionally, prednisone or other steroids may be administered to address inflammation. While the evidence supporting their benefit in acute bronchitis is limited, they can be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Typically, steroids are utilized as a short-term burst therapy. In certain cases, an extended tapering course of steroids may be warranted, especially for patients with underlying asthma or COPD.[27][28] ACCP guidelines recommend against antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis among otherwise healthy adults. A comprehensive Cochrane review of 9 randomized, controlled trials of antibiotic agents found only a minor reduction in the total duration of cough (0.6 days) with no significant decrease in
