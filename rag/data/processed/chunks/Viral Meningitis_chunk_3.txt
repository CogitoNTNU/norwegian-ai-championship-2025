a normal head CT does not preclude increased intracranial pressure or impending brain herniation. If the clinical symptoms are consistent with impending herniation, regardless of whether or not the CT head is normal, avoid the LP and start treatment. Blood work should include blood culture, serum electrolytes as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is not uncommon, serum glucose, renal and liver function, and testing for HIV. ## Treatment / Management Antibiotics and supportive care are critical in all cases of bacterial meningitis.[13][14][15] Managing the airway, maintaining oxygenation, giving sufficient intravenous fluids while providing fever control are parts of the foundation of meningitis management. The type of antibiotic is based on the presumed organism causing the infection. The clinician must take into account patient demographics and past medical history in order to provide the best antimicrobial coverage. **Current Empiric Therapy** Neonates - Up to 1 month old - Ampicillin intravenously (IV) and - Cefotaxime (or equivalent, usually ceftazidime or cefepime) IV or gentamicin IV and - Acyclovir IV More than 1 month old - Ampicillin IV and - Ceftriaxone IV Adults (18 to 49 years old) - Ceftriaxone IV and - Vancomycin IV Adults older than 50 years old and the immunocompromised - Ceftriaxone IV and - Vancomycin IV and - Ampicillin IV Meningitis associated with a foreign body (post-procedure, penetrating trauma) - Cefepime IV or ceftazidime IV or meropenem IV and - Vancomycin IV Meningitis with severe penicillin allergy - Moxifloxacin IV and - Vancomycin IV Fungal (Cryptococcal) meningitis - Amphotericin B IV and - Flucytosine by mouth **Antibiotics** Ceftriaxone - Third-generation cephalosporin - Gram-negative coverage - Very effective against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Neisseria meningitidis_ - Better CNS penetration than piperacillin-tazobactam (typically used in gram-negative sepsis coverage) Vancomycin - Gram-positive coverage (MRSA) - Also used for resistant pneumococcus Ampicillin - Listeria coverage (gram-positive bacilli) Cefepime - Fourth-generation cephalosporin - Increased activity against pseudomonas Cefotaxime - Third-generation cephalosporin - Equivalent to ceftriaxone - Safe for neonates **Steroid Therapy** There is insufficient evidence to support the widespread use of steroids in bacterial meningitis. Some studies report a reduction in mortality for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis, but not in _Haemophilus influenzae_ or _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis. In children, steroids were associated with a reduction of severe hearing impairment only in cases of _Haemophilus influenzae_ meningitis.
