quickly become severe if not treated promptly. Although extrapulmonary symptoms are rare, many patients develop severe respiratory distress, often requiring mechanical ventilation.[47] ## Evaluation In a nontoxic-appearing patient, particularly in the outpatient setting, a high clinical suspicion is sufficient to pursue empiric treatment. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis, and sputum Gram stain may show an accumulation of inflammatory cells without any identifiable organisms.[48] Urea levels may be elevated, and although leukocytosis may not always be present in most individuals, it is more likely to be elevated in older age groups. Other laboratory investigations, including serology and molecular testing, often complement and further help risk-stratify individuals and direct treatment.[1] In addition to assessing leukocytosis, some providers may evaluate a left-shift typical of legionellosis or perform a procalcitonin test to help differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However,\*\*\*\* the yield of pro-calcitonin in the clinical setting is often mixed.[49][50][51][52] _Legionella_ species infection may be associated with hyponatremia on electrolyte testing.[53] Patients admitted to the hospital with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia should undergo urinary antigen testing for _L. pneumophila_ species, as _L. longbeachae_ may not be detected by this test. Swabs should also be taken to exclude viral causes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR). Depending on the setting and resources of the healthcare institution, PCR testing can also be run on multiplex panels that include atypical bacterial organisms, including _Legionella_ ,_Chlamydia_ , and _Mycoplasma_ ,\_\_ that appear equivalent to standard single-organism PCR and sequencing.[54][55] Serology testing can be used to confirm cases, but given the time taken to obtain paired samples to analyze for immunoglobulin titer rise or seroconversion, these tests may not assist in the acute clinical setting.[56][57] In addition, it is important to obtain blood cultures to exclude associated bacteremia and, if necessary, collect deep sputum cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens to exclude typical bacterial infections and other infectious causes, such as viruses and fungi, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. These tests can also help identify the growth of atypical bacteria despite the lower yield compared to molecular testing.[1][54]\*\*\*\* These efforts may ultimately assist with later antimicrobial rationalization and de-escalation of antibiotics once the patient has improved. In ill-appearing individuals or those in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a chest x-ray is the diagnostic gold standard. Classic imaging findings in atypical pneumonia include patchy infiltrates, sometimes bilateral in distribution, and interstitial patterns, but these may reflect worse changes than what
