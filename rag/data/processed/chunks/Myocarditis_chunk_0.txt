Although this condition is most commonly caused by viral infections, it can also result from autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity reactions, or exposure to cardiotoxic substances. Diagnosis can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and the overlap with other cardiac conditions. Diagnostic tools, including cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (utilizing the Lake Louise criteria), and, in select cases, endomyocardial biopsy, aid in confirming the diagnosis. Prognosis depends on disease severity, with some patients recovering fully, while others may develop chronic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Management strategies vary according to the stage of the disease. This activity provides a comprehensive review of acute myocarditis, focusing on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in alignment with the 2024 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway. This activity also enhances clinicians' ability to recognize diverse clinical presentations, apply appropriate diagnostic pathways, interpret advanced imaging, and manage complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias. In addition, this activity underscores the importance of interprofessional collaboration among healthcare providers in achieving patient-centered outcomes through evidence-based, team-oriented care, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach. **Objectives:** - Identify early clinical signs and symptoms of acute myocarditis to facilitate timely diagnosis and interventions. - Differentiate acute myocarditis from other cardiac conditions with similar presentations, such as coronary artery disease, pericarditis, or heart failure, based on clinical presentation and diagnostic tools. - Apply evidence-based management strategies for acute myocarditis, including guideline-directed therapy for heart failure, arrhythmias, and etiology-specific treatments. - Collaborate with interprofessional healthcare providers to manage severe cases of myocarditis, particularly those requiring mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation.

Myocarditis was previously referred to as inflammatory myocarditis, and the condition primarily affects individuals aged 40 or younger. Myocarditis is classified into 4 formsâ€”acute, fulminant, chronic active, and chronic persistent.[1] Acute myocarditis accounts for approximately 65% of all myocarditis cases
