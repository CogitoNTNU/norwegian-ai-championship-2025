and giant cell arteritis. Additional causes include acute rheumatic fever, exposure to venoms or chemicals (eg, hydrocarbons), and cellular rejection following cardiac transplantation.[9] ## Epidemiology The true prevalence of acute myocarditis remains uncertain due to its variable clinical presentation and the challenges associated with diagnosis. The condition is frequently underdiagnosed, complicating efforts to determine its exact incidence and prevalence. Acute myocarditis occurs more commonly in younger adults and affects individuals across all sexes and racial groups. However, notable regional variations in incidence have been reported.[10][11] According to the Global Burden of Disease Report (2019), the estimated incidence of acute myocarditis is approximately 6.1 cases per 100,000 individuals.[12] Other sources suggest a broader incidence range, from 10 to 22 cases per 100,000 population. In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million cases were reported globally.[13] Additionally, myocardial involvement is estimated to occur in up to 5% of patients with an acute viral illness. Among individuals presenting with angina-like chest pain, mildly elevated troponin I levels, and no evidence of CAD, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has identified myocarditis in approximately 13% of cases.[14] ## Pathophysiology Acute myocarditis is classified as an inflammatory cardiomyopathy. A triphasic model has been proposed to describe the pathophysiology of acute myocarditis. - Phase I involves direct myocardial injury caused by infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites), toxins, drugs, or autoimmune mechanisms. - Phase II involves an immune-mediated response characterized by cytokine release, cellular infiltration, molecular mimicry, production of antimyocyte antibodies, and a T-cell response targeting cardiac self-antigens. - Phase III represents either resolution or progression to chronic disease. Potential outcomes include complete resolution with full recovery, chronic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyopathy, or progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] Autoimmunity has a significant role in inflammatory myocarditis.[15] Autoantibodies against the cardiac myosin chain are detected in more than half of cases of inflammatory myocarditis. Additionally, environmental factors may interact with genetic predispositions to promote inflammatory responses.[6] In viral myocarditis, the inflammatory process begins when the virus enters myocardial cells, triggering an innate immune response within the first week. This is followed by an adaptive immune response over the subsequent 1 to 4 weeks. In the chronic stage, chronic inflammation and remodelling of the myocardium can lead to myocardial dilation and the development of cardiomyopathy.[6][16] Viral-induced cell damage leads to the release of interleukins (ILs) and damage-associated molecular patterns, which facilitate the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the innate immune system.
