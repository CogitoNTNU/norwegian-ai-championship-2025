end-expiratory pressure** PEEP is the pressure in the lungs (above atmospheric pressure) that remains at the end of the expiratory phase of ventilation. PEEP helps to keep alveoli open, improve oxygenation, and prevent atelectasis. However, excessive PEEP can lead to overdistension and barotrauma. The optimal PEEP level balances these factors to maximize alveolar recruitment while minimizing lung injury.[6] **Inspiratory time** Ti is the duration of the inspiratory phase of ventilation. Adjusting inspiratory time can influence gas exchange and patient comfort. Longer inspiratory times can improve oxygenation but may increase auto-PEEP risk if not properly managed. **Inspiratory flow** V’ is the rate at which air is delivered to the patient during the inspiratory phase. Adjusting inspiratory flow can affect the distribution of ventilation within the lungs and the patient’s work of breathing. Faster flow rates can decrease inspiratory time and increase peak airway pressures. **Inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio** I:E is the ratio of the duration of the inspiratory phase to the expiratory phase. This variable is typically set to 1:2 to mimic normal breathing patterns. Adjusting the I:E ratio can improve oxygenation and CO2 clearance. An inverse I:E ratio (more time in inspiration) may be used in severe hypoxemia but requires careful monitoring to avoid auto-PEEP.[7] **Basic Components of Arterial Blood Gas Analysis** ABG analysis evaluates a patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance. The primary components of an ABG report include pH, PaCO2, PaO2, bicarbonate (HCO3-), and base excess. Together, these parameters provide critical insights for diagnosing and managing respiratory, metabolic, and systemic conditions. **pH** The pH measures the hydrogen ion concentration in the blood, indicating the acidity or alkalinity. The normal pH range is 7.35 to 7.45. A pH below 7.35 indicates acidosis, while a pH above 7.45 indicates alkalosis. This variable determines the acid-base balance and guides the diagnosis of respiratory and metabolic disorders. **Partial pressure of carbon dioxide** The PaCO2 measures the pressure of carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood. The normal PaCO2 range is 35 to 45 mm Hg. An elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg) indicates hypercapnia, commonly due to hypoventilation. Decreased PaCO2 (\<35 mm Hg) indicates hypocapnia, often from hyperventilation. PaCO2 is crucial for assessing the respiratory component of the acid-base balance. **Partial pressure of oxygen** The PaO2 measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood. The normal PaO2 range is 80 to 100 mm Hg. PaO2 is essential for evaluating oxygenation status. Low PaO2 (\<80 mm
