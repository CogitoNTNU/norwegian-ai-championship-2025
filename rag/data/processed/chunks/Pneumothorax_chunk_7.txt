Mediastinitis - Psychiatric - Anxiety or panic attack The possibility of tension pneumothorax and concomitant hemothorax must always be considered in traumatic pneumothorax. Patients with traumatic pneumothorax often have a high association with additional thoracic and abdominal injuries. Therefore, a comprehensive trauma evaluation by emergency physicians and trauma surgeons is essential to identify and manage any concurrent injuries effectively. ## Prognosis The prognosis of spontaneous pneumothorax largely depends on the size of the pneumothorax, the underlying cause, and the patient's overall health. In many cases, small, primary spontaneous pneumothoraxes may resolve on their own with minimal intervention, and the prognosis is generally good. However, recurrence rates are high, ranging from 20% to 60% within 3 years of the initial episode.[51] For patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, often related to underlying lung diseases, the prognosis can be more guarded and may require more aggressive treatment. Early detection and appropriate management are key to reducing complications and improving long-term outcomes. ## Complications Misdiagnosis is a common complication of pneumothorax. Several factors can contribute, including an incomplete or inadequate history or physical examination, low clinical suspicion, failure to obtain a chest radiograph, or failure to recognize a pneumothorax on imaging. Misdiagnosis can result in delayed treatment, leading to serious consequences, such as: [36][52][53][54][55] - Conversion to tension pneumothorax - Hypoxemic respiratory failure - Shock - Respiratory or cardiac arrest - Empyema - Reexpansion pulmonary edema - Iatrogenic complications from needle decompression or thoracostomy procedure, including lung to re-expand, lung laceration, infection at the insertion site, pleural space infection, intercostal vessel or internal mammary artery laceration, hemothorax, persistent air leak, and damage to the intercostal neurovascular bundle - Chest tube-induced arrhythmia - Pneumomediastinum, where air from the pneumothorax tracks into the mediastinum, may present as air lucency around the heart on a chest x-ray. A characteristic crunching sound, Hamman's crunch, can also be auscultated during the cardiac examination, most notably in the left lateral decubitus position. ## Consultations The management of pneumothorax often requires consultation with multiple specialists, depending on its severity and underlying cause. In cases of uncomplicated primary spontaneous pneumothorax, a pulmonologist or emergency medicine physician may oversee treatment, including observation, oxygen therapy, or simple aspiration. However, if the pneumothorax is large, recurrent, or associated with significant symptoms, a thoracic surgeon may be consulted for chest tube placement, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or pleurodesis to prevent recurrence. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, often linked to
