approach for treating acute pulmonary embolism, has limitations. The risk of major bleeding, particularly in high-risk patients, can be significant. Additionally, systemic delivery may not adequately reach and break down the clot, potentially limiting its effectiveness. CDT emerges as a promising alternative. This targeted approach delivers clot-busting medication (thrombolytics) directly to the pulmonary embolism through a catheter, potentially enhancing efficacy while reducing bleeding risk compared to systemic administration. However, the optimal CDT approach remains nuanced, varying based on individual characteristics and pulmonary embolism severity. **Evidence Landscape** While the evidence base for CDT is evolving, it shows promise. Ongoing clinical trials like Pulmonary Embolism-Thrombus Removal with Catheter-Directed Therapy (PE-TRACT) and Higher Risk Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (HI-PEITHO) are investigating its effectiveness in specific patient populations. However, further research is needed to solidify its role and define optimal treatment strategies.

AC = Anticoagulation, tPA = Tissue plasminogen activator, USAT = Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis **CDT in Practice** Several CDT devices are available, each with unique mechanisms. Two such mechanisms are the established EKOS Intelligent Drug Delivery System (IDDC) and the recently approved Bashir Endovascular Catheter (BEC-CDT), each equipped with distinctive instruments to combat pulmonary embolism clots. **EKOS-CDT** - Central conductor: The EKOS-IDDC serves as the central conduit for intervention. This multi-lumen catheter allows simultaneous delivery of a thrombolytic agent (eg, rt-PA) and saline coolant directly to the target thrombus. - Sonic disruption module: The MicroSonic Device (MSD) nested within the IDDC harbors multiple ultrasound transducers that emit targeted low-frequency sonic waves to facilitate clot fragmentation and enhance drug penetration. - Hemodynamic monitoring: Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters (eg, pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output) and electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the procedure and guiding therapeutic adjustments.[22] **BEC-CDT** - Expandable catheter: The 7-F BEC-CDT occupies the central role in this system. Its unique feature is an expandable "basket" equipped with 48 orifices, allowing for strategic deployment and maximizing drug-thrombus contact within the clot. - Pulse spray delivery: A dedicated syringe administers controlled "pulse sprays" of the thrombolytic agent, creating initial fissures within the clot. Subsequently, a continuous infusion pump ensures sustained thrombolysis. - Fluoroscopic visualization: Real-time fluoroscopy offers visual guidance for catheter placement, ensuring optimal positioning of the expanding basket within the target thrombus.[21] **Shared Instrumental Landscape** - Venous access establishment: Both procedures require initial venous access, typically achieved using
