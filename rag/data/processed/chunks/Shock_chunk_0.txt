This activity reviews the evaluation and management of cardiogenic shock and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Outline the etiology of cardiogenic shock. - Describe the history and physical examination of patients with cardiogenic shock. - Review the management of patients with cardiogenic shock. - Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with cardiogenic shock.

Clinical criteria include a systolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for greater than or equal to 30 minutes or support to maintain systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg and urine output less than or equal to 30 mL/hr or cool extremities. Hemodynamic criteria include a depressed cardiac index (less than or equal to 2.2 liters per minute per square meter of body surface area) and an elevated pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure greater than 15 mm Hg. Cardiogenic shock is a clinical entity characterized by a low cardiac output state of circulatory failure that results in end-organ hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is acute myocardial infarction, though other disorders leading to impairment of the myocardium, valves, conduction system, or pericardium also can result in cardiogenic shock. Despite advances in reperfusion therapy and mechanical circulatory support treatments, morbidity, and mortality among patients with cardiogenic shock remain high.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Various forms of cardiac dysfunction can cause cardiogenic shock. [4][5] The most common causes of cardiogenic shock include: - Acute myocardial ischemia - Mechanical defect: acute mitral regurgitation (papillary muscle rupture), ventricular wall rupture (septal or free wall), cardiac tamponade, left ventricular outflow obstruction (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [HOCM],
