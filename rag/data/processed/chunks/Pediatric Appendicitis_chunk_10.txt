appendiceal malignancies. They rarely metastasize; primary metastatic sites are the liver and lymph nodes. Therefore, in patients with suspicious GEP-NETs, further evaluation of the liver and the ileocolic lymph node basin are essential. Surgical management is dictated by the size of the primary tumor. An appendectomy with negative margins is the only surgical management in carcinoid tumors of \<1 cm in size. A right hemicolectomy is indicated for a carcinoid tumor of >2 cm. The optimum surgical intervention for carcinoid tumors measuring from 1 to 2 cm remains undefined. However, a right hemicolectomy is recommended for mesenteric invasion, enlarged lymph nodes, or equivocal surgical margins. **Goblet Cell Carcinoma** Goblet cell carcinomas are ubiquitous in appendiceal malignancies, sharing the diagnostic features of both appendiceal adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. A comprehensive peritoneal evaluation with further peritoneal cancer index score (PCIS) documentation should be undertaken. A right hemicolectomy will benefit patients with a non-metastatic lesion or a lesion â‰¥2 cm in size.[49] **Lymphoma** Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphoma, may initially present as acute appendicitis. The surgical management of this highly uncommon appendiceal malignancy should be limited to a simple appendectomy. However, a comprehensive systemic evaluation should be undertaken to exclude any potential metastatic site.[50] **Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma** Adenocarcinoma of the appendix, a rare appendiceal neoplasm with three histopathological subtypes, commonly presents as acute appendicitis. The standard treatment is a right hemicolectomy. The surgical management of appendiceal adenocarcinoma is irrespective of the tumor size or the involvement of the lymph node basin.[51] **Mucocele and Mucinous Neoplasm** Appendiceal mucoceles can manifest with symptoms similar to acute appendicitis. Mucoceles can arise from various benign or malignant processes involving mucosal hyperplasia and intra-appendiceal cystic formations. Several preoperative radiological features, including a well-encapsulated cystic structure in the right lower quadrant, would raise the suspicion of an appendiceal mucocele; a definitive diagnosis requires intraoperative evaluation and histopathological reports. The preferred surgical management of appendiceal mucoceles is an appendectomy with great cautionary measures to prevent capsular rupture. It is important to assess for peritoneal involvement; peritoneal biopsy should be considered. In cases of suspicious mucinous neoplasm of the appendix, it is vital to perform a thorough peritoneal examination and consider recording any findings using the PCIS when mucin is present. Patient selection for the laparoscopic approach in managing appendiceal mucocele is limited to those with radiologic features suggestive of a homogenous cyst.[52] ## Prognosis Appendectomy is a
