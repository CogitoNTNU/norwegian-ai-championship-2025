Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen - PaO2 = Arterial partial pressure of oxygen Alveolar gas equation:[7] - PAO2 = FiO2 (PB - Pwater) - PaCO2/0.8, or PIo2= (PB - 47) × FIo2, - PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen - FiO2 = Fraction of inspired oxygen - PB = Barometric (Atmospheric) pressure - Pwater = Vapor pressure of water at body temperature (37°C)=47 mmHg - PaCO2 = Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with normal A-a gradients include: - **Alveolar hypoventilation:** Alveolar hypoventilation increases the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that an increase in PaCO2 causes a decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2). In this situation, the A-a gradient is normal, as the PAO2 and PaO2 decrease in equal magnitudes. When severe, alveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure.[8] (as discussed later in this section under Type 2 respiratory failure). - **Low atmospheric pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen:** The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) decreases with low atmospheric pressures (Patm) and with low levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In either situation, the A-a gradient remains normal, and the PaCO2 is decreased, given the response to hypoxia is hyperventilation. Clinically, this cause of respiratory failure occurs at high altitudes.[9] Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with increased A-a gradients include: - **Diffusion defect:** Gas exchange between the environment and the body occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. Structural changes to the alveolar component of the alveolar-capillary interface, such as decreased surface area or increased thickness, may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. Additionally, reducing pulmonary capillary transit time through the alveolar-capillary interface may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. In either situation, hypercapnia does not occur, as carbon dioxide diffuses more readily across the alveolar-capillary membrane than oxygen.[10] Etiologies of diffusion defects include: - Emphysema - Interstitial lung disease - ****Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch:**** The alveolar gas composition depends on the balance of alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary blood flow that occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. When perfectly matched, the V/Q ratio is equal to one. When ventilation is excessive to perfusion, the V/Q ratio is greater than one; Dead space ventilation occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches infinity. When perfusion is excessive to ventilation, the V/Q ratio is less than one; Shunt occurs when the
