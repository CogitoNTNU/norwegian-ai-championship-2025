The disorder is associated with capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage. Once ARDS develops, patients usually have varying degrees of pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and may develop pulmonary hypertension. ARDS carries a high mortality, and few effective therapeutic modalities exist to alleviate this deadly condition. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and highlights the importance of coordinated interprofessional teamwork in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome. - Differentiate a patient presentation consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome from similar conditions. - Select correct ventilatory parameters utilizing the NIH-NHLBI ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation Protocol. - Explain the critical role of well-coordinated, interprofessional teamwork when caring for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

On a microscopic level, the disorder is associated with capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage. ARDS is an acute disorder that starts within seven days of the inciting event and is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates and severe progressive hypoxemia in the absence of any evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. According to the Berlin definition, ARDS is defined by acute onset, bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiography or CT scan of a non-cardiac origin, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg. The Berlin definition differs from the previous American-European Consensus definition by excluding the term acute lung injury; it also removed the requirement for wedge pressure \<18 mm Hg and included the requirement of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of greater than or equal to 5 cm H20. Once ARDS develops, patients usually have
