Febrile seizures are generalized seizures, typically in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, that occur with a fever greater than 100.4 °F (38 °C) not associated with a central nervous system (CNS) infection, a known seizure-provoking etiology (eg, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, or substance abuse), or history of an afebrile seizure.[1] No defined fever threshold is required to precipitate febrile seizures, as each patient's convulsive temperature threshold varies.[2][3] The primary febrile seizure risk factors appear to include existing neurologic impairment, the presence of a viral infection, a family history of seizure, developmental delay, decreased serum zinc and iron levels, and maternal smoking and stress.[1] An estimated 10% to 33% of patients have a first-degree relative with a positive seizure history, along with a concordance rate of approximately 35% to 69% in monozygotic twins and 14% to 20% in dizygotic twins, which suggests that the cause of febrile seizures may have a genetic component.[5][6] An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance and a polygenic or multifactorial mode of inheritance may be present in addition to specific genes that increase the risk of febrile seizures and are found on the following loci of chromosomes: 1q31, 2q23*34, 3p24.2*23, 3q26.2*26.33, 5q14*15, 5q34, 6q22*24, 8q13*21, 18p11*2, 19p13*3, 19q, and 21q22.[5] Another factor determining the risk of febrile seizures may be the highest temperature reached during a fever rather than the speed at which the temperature rises.[7][8][9] A contributing factor that can also affect fever's impact is the seizure threshold, which varies among individuals and changes with age and development. Infants have a higher risk of febrile seizures, but premature infants are at an even higher risk, especially those receiving postnatal corticosteroids.[10] Furthermore, infants generally have a lower seizure threshold, which may be modified by certain medications and water and electrolyte imbalances (eg, hyponatremia). Iron, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, selenium, calcium, and magnesium deficiencies increase the risk of febrile seizures.[5] No specific fever etiology is more likely to cause febrile seizures; however, 80% of viral infections rather than bacterial infections are commonly associated with febrile seizures.[11] _Roseolovirus_ is the most common virus associated with febrile seizures in the US and European countries and is observed in up to one-third of patients younger than 2 years.[12] Other studies have found that febrile seizures secondary to _Roseolovirus_ are associated with a higher incidence of complex features, recurrence, and febrile status epilepticus.[13][14] In
