The epithelial cells, referred to as follicular cells or thyrocytes, surround the colloid in the lumen. The ultimo-branchial cells or neural cells accompanying them are the origins of the C-cells in the thyroid gland, which secrete the hormone calcitonin.[1] The hypothalamus releases thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The anterior pituitary releases TSH and stimulates the thyroid follicular cells to release thyroxine, T4 (80%), triiodothyronine, or T3 (20%). The synthesis of thyroid hormones depends on the availability of iodide, TSH stimulation, and tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin. When T4 is released into circulation, it can convert to T3 through deiodination. T4 and T3 can then exert negative feedback on TSH levels, with high levels of T3/T4 decreasing TSH and low levels of T3/T4 increasing TSH levels from the anterior pituitary. This topic reviews the physiology, biochemistry, and clinical relevance of thyroid hormones.[2] ## Issues of Concern The thyroid follicular cells within the thyroid gland respond to the TSH released from the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary. TSH release from the anterior pituitary is modulated by the release of thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. In primary disease, the disease originates in the thyroid gland. If the thyroid gland is secreting high levels of T3/T4, this provides negative feedback on the anterior pituitary and, thus, decreases the secretion of TSH. If the thyroid gland is secreting low levels of T3/T4, the absence of negative feedback on the anterior pituitary increases TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary. The disease originates in the anterior pituitary for secondary disease or central hyperthyroid or hypothyroid disease. If a tumor in the anterior pituitary is secreting excessively high TSH, this stimulates the thyroid follicular cells to secrete high levels of T3/T4. If the anterior pituitary is secreting low TSH levels, such as in pan-hypopituitarism, this lack of stimulation of thyroid follicular cells causes them to secrete low levels of T4.[3] One must assay the TSH in conjunction with T3/T4 levels to
