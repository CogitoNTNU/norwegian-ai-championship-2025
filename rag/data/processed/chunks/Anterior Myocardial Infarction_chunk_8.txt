equivocal. TTE helps defines wall motion abnormalities in a territorial distribution of the LAD artery. Wall motion abnormalities are seen in the apical, anterior septal, and anterior segments. Additionally, TTE is valuable in identifying mechanical complications, such as ventricular septal rupture, mitral regurgitation, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm in myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Ejection fraction, initially determined by echocardiogram, strongly predicts survival and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with anterior myocardial infarction. **Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR):** In patients presenting with late anterior wall infarction, CMR is instrumental in assessing myocardial viability. Measurement of end-diastolic wall thickness helps assess transmurality of the infarction. A wall thickness of less than 6 mm is less likely to show functional recovery following revascularization. Late gadolinium enhancement involves the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents, which highlight areas of scar tissue. Transmural hyperenhancement, indicating the presence of contrast uptake throughout the full thickness of the myocardium, suggests transmural infarction and lack of viability. Additionally, dobutamine stress CMR can be employed to assess viability by evaluating the contractile reserve of the myocardium. **A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)** is a valuable imaging modality utilized in cases with uncertainty or limited visualization of cardiac structures and mechanical complications with a TTE. ## Treatment / Management Managing myocardial infarction should focus on hemodynamic stability, pain relief, avoiding hypoxia, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, and providing the earliest possible revascularization. **Nitrates** : In patients with ongoing chest pain suggestive of myocardial infarction, administering sublingual nitroglycerin can help alleviate symptoms and improve coronary blood flow. The recommended dose is 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin, which can be repeated every 5 minutes for 3 doses if the pain persists. If the chest pain persists or there is inadequate relief, the need for intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin should be considered. IV nitroglycerin can provide more sustained and controlled vasodilation and may be necessary in severe or refractory chest pain cases. Nitrites should be avoided in patients with systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg, severe bradycardia, suspected RV infarction, and those receiving a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the last 24 hours. **Oxygen** : Maintaining adequate oxygenation is crucial to meet the myocardial oxygen demand. Supplemental oxygen should be considered when the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) falls below 90%. For patients without COPD, supplemental oxygen can be administered at a flow rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute via nasal cannula. This standard starting range can be adjusted based on
