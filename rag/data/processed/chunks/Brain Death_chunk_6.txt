is clinically and legally declared deceased at the time of completion of brain death testing. At this time, depending on family and patient preference, cardiopulmonary support should be withdrawn, or arrangements for organ harvest should commence. Adequate documentation of all criteria of the diagnosis of brain death must be included in the patient's medical record. It is recommended that some form of checklist be used to ensure the completeness of brain death testing.[10] ## Differential Diagnosis Several conditions may mimic brain death, including those listed below. - Vegetative state - Minimally responsive state - Locked-in syndrome[22] - Hypothermia - Drug intoxication - Guillan-Barre syndrome - Delayed paralytic clearance The clinicians should perform a clinical evaluation to exclude these conditions before proceeding with the brain death examination. It is essential to differentiate between coma and brain death. When the AAN guidelines are followed, there have been no misdiagnoses of brain death reported in the literature; of the reported misdiagnoses, at least one violation of the AAN guidelines was identified.[10][23] ## Prognosis The prognosis of brain death, by definition, is 100% fatal.[24] ## Complications Questioning the diagnosis of brain death only arises when AAN guidelines or protocols for brain death determination are not followed. These complications are limited to misdiagnosing a different neurologic condition as brain death and the ultimate death of a patient who was not brain dead.[25] ## Deterrence and Patient Education The diagnosis of brain death is difficult for families to accept. However, research supports asking the family to witness the clinical evaluation of brain death will help them understand the diagnosis. Multiple meetings with more than one provider, clergy, social workers, or ancillary staff may be necessary for the family's acceptance of the diagnosis.[23] ## Pearls and Other Issues Requirements for the diagnosis of brain death are coma with an identified cause, absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea. The diagnosis is best made by closely following the American Academy of Neurology guidelines.[26] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The designation of brain death involves an interprofessional team. Nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy will play a vital role in coordinating with families during the process of brain death examination and counseling after the diagnosis has been made. Subspecialists, such as intensivists, neurologists, or neurosurgeons, are required to interpret the physical examination findings, and radiologists may be necessary to interpret ancillary testing if the clinical diagnosis is inconclusive.
