with a score over 5 indicating a high likelihood for overt DIC.[18][19][20][21] ## Treatment / Management The treatment for DIC centers on addressing the underlying disorder that ultimately led to this condition. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and consideration for exploratory surgical intervention in trauma-related cases represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. A common threshold utilized for platelet transfusions in this patient population is less than 50 x 109 platelets/L for actively hemorrhaging patients and 10-20 x 109 platelets/L for those not actively bleeding but at high risk of future bleeding. Likewise, fresh frozen plasma, typically at 15 mL/kg to 30 mL/kg, and cryoprecipitate can be transfused to replenish coagulation factors. Prothrombin complex concentrate may also be considered; however, this formulation only contains some coagulation factors and will only mildly correct a patientâ€™s hemostasis. Heparin may also become necessary if a patient has extensive clotting, as this medication may prevent further activation of the clotting cascade. Patients with DIC who are not actively bleeding should receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin.[5][11][19][20][22] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for disseminated intravascular coagulation includes: - Dysfibrinogenemia - Hemolytic uremic syndrome - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - Immune thrombocytopenia - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ## Pearls and Other Issues Disseminated intravascular coagulation can quickly lead to multiorgan failure and death, particularly if early recognition and treatment fail to occur. A high index of suspicion of this high-mortality disease in critically ill patients remains paramount to improving outcomes in patients with DIC. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of DIC are complex and challenging. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that could consist of a hematologist, surgeon, intensivist, infectious disease consultant, pathologist, and internist. The key is to address the underlying disorder that ultimately led to this condition developing. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and consideration for exploratory surgical intervention in trauma-related cases represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. Despite optimal treatment, DIC carries a very high
