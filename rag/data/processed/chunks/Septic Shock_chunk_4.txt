pediatric patients **Signs and Symptoms of Severe Sepsis** Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis and end-organ dysfunction. At this stage, signs and symptoms may include: - Altered mental status - Oliguria or anuria - Hypoxia - Cyanosis - Ileus Patients progressing to septic shock will experience signs and symptoms of severe sepsis with hypotension. Of note, at an early "compensated" stage of shock, blood pressure may be maintained, and other signs of distributive shock might be present, for example, warm extremities, flash capillary refill (less than one second), and bounding pulses, also known as warm shock. This stage of shock, if managed aggressively with fluid resuscitation and vasoactive support, can be reversed. With the progression of septic shock into the uncompensated stage, hypotension ensues, and patients may present with cool extremities, delayed capillary refill (more than three seconds), and thready pulses, also known as cold shock. After that, with continued tissue hypoperfusion, shock may be irreversible, progressive rapidly into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death. ## Evaluation **Laboratory Findings** Findings in sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock are as follows \[16\]: - Hyperglycemia (glucose more than 120 mg/dL) - Leukocytosis (WBC more than 12,000/mm3) or leukopenia (WBC less than 4000/mm3) - Bandemia (more than 10%) - C-reactive protein or procalcitonin more than 2 SD above normal - Mixed venous saturation of more than 70% - PaO2: FiO2 less than 300 - Pre-renal azotemia - Coagulopathy, INR more than 1.5 or PTT more than 60 sec - Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL) - Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin more than 4 mg/dL) - Lactic acidosis (more than 2 mmol/L) Patients should be placed on continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring to allow close observation of vital signs. A thorough assessment of end-organ function and peripheral perfusion should be undertaken to determine where they may fall along the pathophysiologic continuum of sepsis. This should include a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) or mental status assessment, urine output measurement, or lactate/mixed venous saturation determination (with central lines). Regardless of where along the continuum patients are, all patients should have drawn a complete blood count with differential (CBC-d), source cultures (blood, urine, tracheal (if intubated), wound), and a urinalysis. Depending on the severity of presentation and age of the patient, a lumbar puncture may be indicated, for example, in patients with signs of encephalitis or meningitis or febrile pediatric patients under six weeks of age.
