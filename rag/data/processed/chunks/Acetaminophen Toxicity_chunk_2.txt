with less than 5% appearing as unconjugated or free acetaminophen. Over 90% of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. ## Administration **Available Dosage Forms** Acetaminophen can be administered through oral, rectal, or IV routes.[10] - Oral: Acetaminophen is available in various formulations, including tablets, capsules, syrup, oral solution, or suspension. - Rectal: Acetaminophen is available as a rectal suppository for adult and pediatric patients. - IV: Acetaminophen is also available as an IV infusion for administration. Tompkins et al conducted a literature review on the effectiveness of IV acetaminophen in postoperative pain control.[11] The investigators found a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of IV acetaminophen when compared to oral or rectal acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, or placebo across various surgical procedures, including abdominal, gynecological, genitourinary, orthopedic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and renal surgeries. The investigators conclude that IV acetaminophen offers limited clinical benefits compared to oral or rectal administration. Establishing the maximum daily allowable dosage of acetaminophen involves considering all modes of administration, including IV, oral, and rectal, as well as all formulations containing acetaminophen. **Dosages for Adults and Adolescents** **Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight of ≥50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. Notably, the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen should not exceed 4000 mg. **Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight \<50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. In addition, it is essential to adhere to a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen not exceeding 75 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 3750 mg. **Specific Patient Populations** **Hepatic impairment:** Acetaminophen is contraindicated in cases of active liver disease or severe hepatic impairment. Caution is advised for patients with mild hepatic impairment, necessitating a reduced total daily dosage of acetaminophen and regular monitoring of liver function. **Renal impairment:** In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min), extending dosing intervals and reducing the total daily dosage of acetaminophen may be advisable. **Pregnancy considerations:** Observational studies have associated prenatal acetaminophen exposure with potential reproductive and neurobehavioral effects, including the risks of cryptorchidism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
