on a biphasic defibrillator or 360 joules using a monophasic. Patients receiving prompt defibrillation have shown improved survival (39.3%) compared to patients in whom defibrillation was delayed by 2 minutes or more (22.2%).[10] Administer epinephrine and amiodarone as per ACLS protocol in patients sustaining VF rhythm regardless of receiving 3 shocks. Amiodarone significantly improves survival to hospital admission without affecting survival to hospital discharge.[11] Identifying and addressing the cause of inciting event is equally important. Professionals should undertake cause-specific measures such as securing the airway, correcting electrolytes, administrating fluids, decompressing pneumothorax, draining tamponade while resuscitating the patient. Once the patient attains return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), physicians should begin a definitive evaluation for coronary artery disease. **Preventative Management** Primary prevention has been a significant factor in reducing VF-related SCDs. Most VF transition from VT and other VA and hence identifying such arrhythmias at an early stage can help prevent VF. In patients with symptoms suspected to be related to VA, detection using ambulatory electrocardiography and implanted cardiac monitors is recommended. [7]. Healthcare professionals should offer family members of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes genetic testing and counseling for risk stratification. \*\*_Medication Therapy_ \*\* Amiodarone is the most commonly studied antiarrhythmic for prevention of SCD. The overall effect of amiodarone on survival is controversial. Most studies have failed to show any added benefit when compared to placebo or ICD.[12] Sotalol, on the other hand, is associated with an increased risk of mortality by decreasing the defibrillation threshold. A meta-analysis published in 2007 showed a significant reduction in risk of SCD with statin treatment.[13] Lower SCD incidence has been reported in patients on chronic beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. \*\*_Defibrillators_ \*\* Randomized control trials such as MADIT-I (Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial), MADIT-II, SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) have clearly demonstrated mortality benefits with ICD when compared to standard medical therapy. Trials comparing ICD with antiarrhythmic therapy such as AVID (Antiarrhythmic Versus Implantable Defibrillator) have shown similar results. ICD placement is recommended for primary prevention of SCD in patients at increased risk of life-threatening VF/VT. ICD placement is also indicated for secondary prevention of SCD in patients with prior episodes of VF and sustained VT. ## Differential Diagnosis It is important to differentiate VF from pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole as both these conditions are managed differently as per ACLS protocol.
