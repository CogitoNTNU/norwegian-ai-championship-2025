and greater than 1 mm ST-segment depression. These patients can have false-positive results on an exercise stress test. 1. Symptomatic aortic stenosis.[4] ## Potential Diagnosis **Medications used for stress testing diagnosis include all of the following.** **Adenosine** Adenosine acts on the coronary arteries through specific activation of the A2A receptor and causes them to dilate.[5][6] There are 4 types of adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. - Activation of the A1 receptor results in decreased atrioventricular conduction and reduces heart rate. - Activation of A2A receptors in vascular smooth muscles in blood vessels such as in coronary arteries causing vasodilation - Activation of the A2B and A3 receptors in bronchial beds can also result in bronchospasm. Dose: The dose of adenosine used during a pharmacologic stress testing is 140 mcg/kg/min, and it is given continuously for 6 minutes duration. The radioactive material is normally given at 3 minutes, and then adenosine is kept infusing for 3 more minutes. There is an additional methodology in which adenosine is given for 4 minutes as a continuous infusion, and its effects and outcomes are comparable to the continuous infusion lasting for 6 minutes.[7] Adenosine generally produces a modest increase in heart rate and a modest decrease in blood pressure. The infusion results in a 3.5- to 4-fold increase in coronary blood flow over baseline. The half-life of adenosine is less than 10 seconds.[1] Limiting caffeine intake: Methylxanthines such as theophylline or caffeine, block adenosine binding due to antagonistic action at A2A receptors and can reduce the coronary vasodilation effects of adenosine. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue consumption of caffeine-containing medications, foods, or beverages for at least 12 hours and ideally 24 hours before adenosine stress testing.[8] Contraindications: 1. Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with reactive airway disease with significant wheezing 1. Patients with a history of advanced conduction abnormalities, including 2nd or 3rd-degree atrioventricular block in the absence of a permanent pacemaker. 1. Patients with a history of abnormalities in the sinus node in the absence of a permanent pacemaker 1. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg 1. Poorly controlled blood pressure with systolic blood pressure significantly higher (over 200 mmHg at rest). 1. Caffeine intake in the previous 12 hours 1. Known hypersensitivity to adenosine 1. Patients with acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina or who experienced a myocardial infarction less than 1 week ago. **Dipyridamole** Dipyridamole was
