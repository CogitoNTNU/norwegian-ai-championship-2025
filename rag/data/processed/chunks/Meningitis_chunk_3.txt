cause, additional associated findings may be present.[2][4] ## Evaluation In recent years, although the cause of aseptic meningitis remains unidentified in up to two-thirds of cases, advances in diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of pathogens. Similarly, substantial progress has been achieved in detecting and diagnosing autoimmune or paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.[2] The initial assessment should involve laboratory testing to explore other potential causes of the symptoms (see **Image.** Laboratory Evaluation for Aseptic Meningitis). This evaluation usually includes a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and testing for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) for enterovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and HSV.[2] A lumbar puncture (LP) is essential for collecting CSF to establish a definitive diagnosis.[2][4][7] During CSF analysis, it is crucial to assess cell count, measure glucose and protein levels, perform a gram stain, conduct cultures, and employ bacterial PCR (typically targeting _Neisseria meningitides_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , and _Haemophilus influenzae_. Specific viral PCR studies should also be selected based on the patient's clinical presentation. Other tests to consider include syphilis serology, tuberculosis (TB) testing, and serum HIV testing. Viral CSF PCR can detect enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, and arbovirus.[2][4][7] Typical CSF findings in patients with aseptic meningitis include an opening pressure that is either normal (\<180 mmH2O) or slightly elevated. Glucose levels are usually normal to mildly decreased, while protein levels are normal to mildly elevated (\<200 mg/dL). The cell count ranges from 10 to 1000 cells per microliter, with an initial predominance of neutrophils (>50%) that gradually shifts toward lymphocytes (>80%) over time.[2][4][7] For patients in the US presenting between June and September, it is advisable to test for West Nile virus IgM in the CSF or serum.[15] Significant differences exist between adults and children in the presentation and laboratory findings.[7] These differences often require specialized approaches in diagnosis and treatment tailored to each age group, emphasizing the importance of age-specific considerations in managing patients with aseptic meningitis. Adults typically report symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, malaise, and photophobia. They are more likely to exhibit nuchal rigidity during examinations compared to children. Fever, concurrent respiratory illness, and rash are signs and symptoms that are more commonly observed in children.[7] Just as physical findings can differ, adult patients tend
