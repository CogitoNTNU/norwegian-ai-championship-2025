such cases, steroids can be given to the increased arteriolar expression of alpha-1 receptors. Hydrocortisone 100 mg is the typical treatment. In cases where vasopressor drips are not immediately available, and the patient has critically low perfusion pressure (particularly MAP less than 50 mmHg, the critical perfusion pressure to the brain), push dose vasopressors can be utilized. Epinephrine and phenylephrine are common agents of choice for this purpose. Soon after resuscitation consider a diet. Some patients may require tube feedings and others may require parenteral feeding. ## Differential Diagnosis - Anaphylaxis - CO poisoning - Adverse drug reaction - Neurogenic shock - Toxic shock syndrome - Cyanide poisoning - Cardiogenic shock - Hemorrhagic shock - Tamponade ## Prognosis The mortality from distributive shock varies on the cause and can range from 20-80%. Early recognition is the key to improved survival. Higher mortality rates are linked to: - Positive blood cultures - Advanced age - Elevated serum lactate or failure to clear lactate when labs are repeated - Infection due to pseudomonas aeruginosa - Alcohol use - Immunocompromised state - Poor functional status prior to the event ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Distributive shock is a life-threatening condition with multiple causes. It carries high morbidity and mortality if not rapidly diagnosed and treated appropriately. Outcomes are dependent on underlying etiology, and multiple medical specialties and varying levels of nursing care may be required depending on the cause of shock. The underlying etiology of distributive shock must be addressed and treated to maximize patient outcomes. Intense nursing interventions and ICU monitoring are frequently required in these critically ill patients with frequent reporting of progress to the clinical team. Evidence shows that early enteral nutrition results in better outcomes, and diet should be initiated when appropriate. The critically ill ICU patient will benefit from interprofessional rounds that may include a nutritionist, pharmacist, PT/OT, and other patient care providers which will result in coordinated care and team monitoring which will improve outcomes. **Outcomes** Patients who do respond to a fluid challenge and have no organ failure have good outcomes. Patients with multiple organ dysfunction and the need for high doses of vasopressors usually have a poor outcome.[14][15] (Level V) ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28974&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28974) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/distributive-shock/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28974) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28974/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28974) ## References 1.
