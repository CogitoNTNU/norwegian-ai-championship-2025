and can be kept at refrigerated temperatures for three days. NT-proBNP can be tested in serum and plasma collected in either heparin or EDTA. When EDTA plasma is used, NT-proBNP concentration is about 10% lower than for serum or lithium heparin.[31] ## Testing Procedures Both BNP and NT-proBNP levels can be tested through standard blood draws. There are also point-of-care BNP assays, which take approximately fifteen minutes for results and are often helpful in emergent settings.[32] BNP and NT-proBNP are determined by several different immunoassays using antibodies directed to different epitopes on the antigen molecules.[33] Before introduction into clinical practice, BNP and NT-proBNP assays must be characterized with respect to the following pre-analytical and analytical issues:[34] **Pre-Analytical** a. Effect of storage time and temperatureb. Influence of different anticoagulantsc. Influence of gel separator tubesd. Plastic blood collection tubes are necessary for BNP; for NT-proBNP, either glass or plastic is acceptable **Analytical** a. Identification of both antibody recognition epitopesb. Cross-reactivity characteristics with related natriuretic peptides, including NT-pro ANP, ANP, CNP, BNP, and glycosylated and nonglycosylated NTproBNP and proBNPc. Identification of interferences from heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors, and human antimouse antibodiesd.

Clarification of dilution responses ## Interfering Factors BNP and NT-proBNP levels may be affected by specific comorbidities, such as chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[23] Levels are higher in patients with renal failure, diabetes, and ACS and lower in patients with obesity.[7] Decreasing renal function with age may be partly responsible for the increase in BNP/NT-proBNP. In the absence of heart failure, the concentration of BNP/NT-proBNP increases in patients with a decreasing glomerular filtration rate.[35] It is also possible that elderly subjects who appear healthy may have declining cardiac function not detectable by current noninvasive techniques.[36] The body mass index (BMI) is another variable influencing the reference intervals for BNP and NT-proBNP. Patients with a BMI in the obese range have lower BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations than patients with a normal or underweight BMI. There have been several theories as to the mechanism for these observations.[37] Natriuretic peptide receptors are found in high concentrations in adipose tissues, suggesting that BNP is degraded. However, this does not account for the obesity effect seen for NT-proBNP, which is not degraded by these receptors.[38] Therefore, comparisons of levels among patients are less meaningful
