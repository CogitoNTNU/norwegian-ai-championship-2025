similar for patients with HFpEF and HFrEF.[27][93] The presence and severity of common comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease significantly influence the prognosis of patients with HFpEF.[27][94][27] Biomarkers like BNP, NT-pro BNP, and high-sensitivity troponin are associated with prognosis in HFpEF; elevated biomarker levels may indicate increased cardiovascular risk. Independent predictors of mortality in patients with HFpEF confer a poor prognosis.[10][52][36][53][94] These predictors include but are not limited to: - Older age - Male sex - NYHA class C or D - Lower LVEF and the degree of diastolic dysfunction - Extent of coronary artery disease - Peripheral artery disease - Diabetes - Functional renal impairment - Pulmonary hypertension - Right ventricular dysfunction - Atrial fibrillation - Increased red cell distribution width. ## Complications Complications stemming from HFpEF are multifaceted, reflecting the intricate interplay of diverse risk factors, complex pathophysiological processes, and the heterogeneous nature of this clinical syndrome. Left atrial dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension often develop, placing an increased workload on the right ventricle and increasing the risk of biventricular failure. Beyond cardiovascular implications, HFpEF introduces complications associated with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Impaired exercise tolerance and functional decline are common, as diminished physiologic reserve manifests in more severe dyspnea and fatigue, impacting daily activities. Diagnostic challenges and overlapping symptoms make timely identification complex, potentially delaying appropriate interventions. Therapeutic challenges arise from the varied responses to interventions among HFpEF patients, necessitating a personalized, multidisciplinary approach to manage these complications effectively. Ongoing research endeavors aim to deepen our understanding and refine strategies for addressing the intricate complications associated with HFpEF, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. ## Consultations Patients with HFpEF typically present to a primary care provider with complaints of exertional dyspnea, activity intolerance, and fatigue. However, the diagnosis of HFpEF may require the expertise of a cardiologist. Once a diagnosis of HFpEF is made, patients require consultation with the cardiac rehabilitation team, cardiac nursing, and a cardiac dietitian. Underlying comorbidities may necessitate consultation with interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, pulmonology-sleep medicine, endocrinology, or a heart failure specialist. While the primary care team can meet most primary palliative care needs, consultation with social workers, case management, or palliative care specialists may become necessary to identify barriers to adequate care and provide patient- and family-specific support.
