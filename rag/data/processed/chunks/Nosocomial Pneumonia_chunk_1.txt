a rate of 5 to 10 per 1000 hospital admissions and is considered the most common cause of hospital-acquired infection in Europe and the United States. Over 90% of pneumonia episodes developing in ICUs occur in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated.[1][3] ## History and Physical Symptoms may include cough, expectoration, a rise in body temperature, chest pain, or dyspnea. Signs include fever, tachypnea, consolidations, or crackles. ## Evaluation **Clinical Evaluation** Establishing the diagnosis of HAP remains controversial, and there is no superior method. In the guidelines for the management of HAP and VAP by the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2016, diagnosis is based upon the presence of a new lung infiltrate and clinical evidence that the infiltrate is of an infectious cause (new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and a decline in oxygenation). Clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS), which includes clinical and radiological criteria, is suggested to increase the likelihood of the presence of pneumonia, but some investigators suggest that the CPIS, while being sensitive, lacks specificity and leads to unnecessary antimicrobial treatment\*\*[4][5]\*\* **Bacteriologic Evaluation** For patients with VAP sampling the lower airways to get quantitative cultures can be done by: - _Blind tracheobronchial aspiration (TBAS)_ is a noninvasive technique done by inserting a flexible catheter into the distal trachea via the endotracheal tube. This technique is relatively noninvasive. However, this blind technique prevents direct sampling of the lung segments which have an infiltrate on the radiograph, and this may lead to increasing the false-negative rate. Also, contamination of the suction catheter, as it traverses the endotracheal tube and more proximal airways, may increase the false-positive rate. - _Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)_ allows the sampling of the lung segments which are suspected to be affected by pneumonia, decreasing the false-negative rate. But, the technique is operator dependent, and contamination of the bronchoscope can affect the results. Also, bronchoscopy can worsen hypoxemia which may not be tolerated by some patients. - _Protected specimen brush (PSB)_ can be advanced through a bronchoscope and has the advantage of avoiding contamination with upper airway secretions, as it is not advanced until positioned in the distal airway.[6] For patients with HAP (non-VAP), noninvasive methods for sampling the lower airways include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, and nasotracheal suctioning in a patient who cannot cooperate to produce a sputum sample. All respiratory tract samples should be sent for microscopic analysis
