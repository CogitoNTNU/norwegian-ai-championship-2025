PE vary depending on the size and severity. Acute massive and submassive PEs should be considered for catheter-directed tPA. Smaller pulmonary embolisms in the absence of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain can be found for systemic anticoagulation.[13] All institutions currently or planning on treating PEs in the future are encouraged to set up a pulmonary embolism response team made up of a cardiologist and pulmonologist. This team is designed to swiftly and accurately triage new PEs for appropriate treatment.[14] **Pericarditis** Pericarditis can be managed with ibuprofen and colchicine for at least three months. If recurrent pericarditis occurs, a longer course of treatment is recommended.[15] **Drug-drug interaction or Intoxication** Serum drug levels may help identify intoxication with a particular medication that may be causing ECG abnormalities. It is recommended to stop the drug if intoxication or drug-drug interaction is suspected while workup is being done. Some drugs have reversal agents. For example, dig immune Fab is the first-line agent for digoxin toxicity. It is an immunoglobulin fragment that binds with digoxin and neutralizes it.[10] ## Differential Diagnosis **The differential diagnoses for ECG T waves include the following:** **T-wave Inversion** - Normal variant - Myocardial ischemia - Ventricular strain - Cerebrovascular injury - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Idiopathic - Left bundle branch block - Right bundle branch block - Ventricular beats **Peaked T-waves** - The hyperacute phase of myocardial infarction - Prinzmetal angina - Normal variant - Hyperkalemia - Left ventricular hypertrophy - Left bundle branch block - Acute pericarditis[4] ## Prognosis The prognosis depends mainly on the underlying etiology. T-wave abnormalities seen on the EKG may be benign or represent severe, life-threatening conditions. The ECG and a thorough history and physical provide valuable information about the patient's etiology and prognosis. ## Complications The worst complication of T-wave abnormalities is a misdiagnosis of serious T-wave pathology or delay in treatment intervention. Other possible complications include cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia or infarction, arrhythmia, tamponade, heart failure, and even death. ## Consultations Consultations with interventional cardiology would be appropriate in the setting of suspected myocardial infarction. It is recommended that a consult is placed to nephrology in the context of chronic kidney disease or severe hyperkalemia. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients must be educated on the signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease and instructed to seek medical attention when these arise.
