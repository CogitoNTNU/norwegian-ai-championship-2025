It is characterized by ventricular dilation and impairment in cardiac function. ACM represents one of the leading causes of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The major risk factor for developing ACM is chronic alcohol use; however, there is no cutoff value for the amount of alcohol consumption that would lead to the development of ACM. This activity describes the pathophysiology of ACM, its causes, presentation and the role of the interprofessional team in its management. ACM is characterized by increased left ventricular mass, dilatation of the left ventricle, and heart failure (both systolic and diastolic). This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Review the evaluation of a patient with ACM. - Summarize the treatment options for ACM. - Describe the pathophysiology of ACM. - Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by ACM.

These findings are coupled with a clinical history of heavy alcohol use in the absence of coronary artery disease as a supportive etiology.[1] Alcohol use is an important cause for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and accounts for 10% of all cases of dilated cardiomyopathies.[2] The major risk factor for developing ACM is chronic alcohol abuse; however, there is no specific cutoff value for the amount of alcohol consumption that would lead to the development of ACM.[3][4][5] ## Etiology Alcohol and its metabolites are cardiotoxic. Myocardial depression secondary to alcohol is initially reversible however prolonged sustained alcohol use leads to irreversible dysfunction. Dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to alcohol use does not have a pre-defined exposure time. Daily alcohol consumption of 80 g per day or more for more than 5 years significantly increases the risk, however not all
