According to KDIGO, AKI is the presence of any of the following:[4] 1. Increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL or more (26.5 μmol/L or more) within 48 hours 1. Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times or more than the baseline of the prior 7 days 1. Urine volume less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 hours The RIFLE criteria define 3 categories of impairment—risk, injury, and failure—and 2 categories of long-term renal outcomes—loss and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Whichever criterion shows the most impairment is used for classification. When baseline Cr is unknown, a baseline GFR between 75 and 100 mL/min is assumed, or the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation can be used to calculate an estimated baseline Cr.[4][5] 1. Risk: Cr ↑ of 1.5x baseline, GFR ↓ of 25%, or urine output \<0.5mL/kg/h for 6 h 1. Injury: Cr ↑ of 2x baseline, GFR ↓ of 50%, or urine output \<0.5mL/kg/h for 12 h 1. Failure: Cr ↑ of 3x baseline, GFR ↓ of 75 %, Cr ≥4.0, or urine output \<0.5mL/kg/h for 12 h 1. Loss: Loss of kidney function for over 4 weeks 1. ESRD: Loss of kidney function for over 3 months The AKIN criteria are based on the RIFLE criteria and are also called the "modified RIFLE" criteria. While the RIFLE and KDIGO systems have higher sensitivity than AKIN, all 3 have similar predictive abilities for in-hospital mortality.[4] ## Etiology The impetus for glomerular filtration is the pressure difference between the glomerulus and Bowman's space. This pressure gradient is affected by the renal blood flow and is under the direct control of the combined resistances of afferent and efferent vascular pathways. For most causes of AKI, renal blood flow reduction is a common pathologic pathway for declining GFR. The pathophysiology of AKI has traditionally been divided into three categories: prerenal, intrinsic renal (ie, intrarenal), and postrenal. Each of these categories has many different associated causes, and some causative factors of AKI have overlapping mechanisms of injury.[6][7] The prerenal form of AKI is due to any cause of reduced blood flow to the kidney. This may be part of systemic hypoperfusion resulting from hypovolemia or due to selective hypoperfusion of the kidneys, such as resulting from renal artery stenosis or aortic dissection. However, tubular and glomerular function tends to be initially normal. A few examples of prerenal AKI mechanisms are
