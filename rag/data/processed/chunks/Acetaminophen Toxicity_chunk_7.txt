NAC for 20 or 21 hours and then discontinuing without reassessing the patient. The panel chose to refine the Rumack-Matthew nomogram by retaining only the lines indicating clinical action. In this refined approach, the blood concentration of APAP is directly plotted on the nomogram, and NAC is administered to patients whose concentration exceeds the treatment line. Stopping criteria for NAC include an acetaminophen concentration below 10 μg/dL, an INR level below 2, normal levels of AST/ALT, or a decrease in AST/ALT by 25% to 50%, provided the patient is clinically stable.[27] High-risk ingestion involves the consumption of at least 30 g of acetaminophen or an acetaminophen concentration surpassing the high-risk line on the nomogram. These cases are managed similarly to other acetaminophen overdoses, with consideration for the extended administration of activated charcoal, especially if the ingestion occurred more than 4 hours prior due to prolonged absorption. In addition, consultation with a clinical toxicologist may be required for an increased NAC dosage. In managing repeated supratherapeutic ingestion in 24 hours, unlike acute ingestion cases, treatment is based on signs and symptoms. If the acetaminophen concentration exceeds 20 μg/mL or AST levels or ALT are abnormal, NAC should be administered until the established stopping criteria are met. Extended-release acetaminophen products, intended for 8-hour use in the United States or Canada, are managed similarly to other acetaminophen products. Activated charcoal may continue to be effective for longer than 4 hours after ingestion, especially when evidence indicates ongoing absorption, such as an increasing acetaminophen concentration. NAC is required if the acetaminophen concentration from samples drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion surpasses the nomogram treatment line. In cases where the concentration from samples drawn 4 to 12 hours after ingestion falls below the treatment line but remains above 10 μg/mL, a follow-up measurement should be taken 4 to 6 hours after the initial assessment. In simultaneous ingestion with anticholinergic or opioid agonists, the concern is the potential for delays or prolongation of acetaminophen absorption. The management approach aligns with that of other acetaminophen products. If the initial acetaminophen concentration measured 4 to 24 hours after ingestion is 10 μg/mL or lower, further measurements are unnecessary, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment is not required. Conversely, if any concentration exceeds the treatment line, NAC is indicated. If the acetaminophen concentration measured within the same time frame falls between 10 μg/mL and the treatment line on the revised
