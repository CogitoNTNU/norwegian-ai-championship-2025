a micropuncture needle and introducer sheath, contingent upon individual patient anatomy and institutional protocols. - Guidewire navigation: A guidewire serves as the forerunner, facilitating the catheters' navigation to the target thrombus within the pulmonary artery. - Anticoagulation support: Anticoagulant therapy plays a crucial role in both paradigms, preventing further clot formation and maintaining vascular patency throughout the procedure. ## Personnel The new guidelines recommend a PERT approach at healthcare facilities.[23] The PERT is a multidisciplinary team specialized in diagnosing and managing acute pulmonary embolism. It brings together experts from various specialties to collaborate on optimal patient care. PERTs usually focus on submassive and massive pulmonary embolism cases but can also benefit low-risk patients with major contraindications to standard anticoagulation, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Critical considerations for PERT activation include the following: - The initiation of anticoagulation remains crucial and should not be delayed unless contraindicated. - PERT activation should occur concurrently with implementing treatment recommendations. - The PERT structure varies by institution but may involve specialties such as critical care, pulmonology, cardiology, interventional radiology, and more. - Each member plays a specific role in patient care, from diagnosis and risk stratification to procedures and medication management. The PERT algorithm provides a general framework and may require adaptation based on specific institutional protocols and patient needs.[24] The following steps encompass the PERT approach to the management of pulmonary embolism: 1. **Patient identification:** Identify patients with suspected or confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, especially submassive or massive cases. Consider low-risk pulmonary embolism with significant contraindications to anticoagulation. 1. **PERT activation:** Trigger activation based on predefined criteria (eg, pulmonary embolism severity and comorbidities). Ensure a precise mechanism for team notification and assembly. 1. **Initial assessment:** The emergency medicine or admitting team performs initial patient evaluation and diagnosis. They gather relevant data such as clinical presentation, risk factors, vital signs, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. 1. **Multidisciplinary consultation:** PERT convenes to discuss the case and treatment options. Consider the potential roles of each specialty: - Critical care: Hemodynamic management, respiratory support - Pulmonology: Diagnosis, risk stratification, follow-up - Cardiology: Medical management, thrombolysis consideration - Radiology: Advanced imaging, procedures (eg, catheter embolectomy) - Vascular surgery: Surgical thrombectomy if needed - Hematology: Anticoagulation selection, thrombophilia evaluation - Pharmacy: Medication dosing and monitoring 1. **Treatment decision:** PERT collaboratively determines the most appropriate treatment approach based on patient factors and available resources. Options may include: - Anticoagulation alone -
