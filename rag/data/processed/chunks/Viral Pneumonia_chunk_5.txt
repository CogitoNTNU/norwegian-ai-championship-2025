## Evaluation As noted above, both history and physical examination may provide few diagnostic cues as to the etiology of pneumonia (bacterial versus virus). With the existence of specific effective treatment modalities, diagnoses of and identification of viruses causing pneumonia is of increased importance. Fortunately, the diagnostic acuity of laboratory examination in combination with radiography and history and physical examination has progressed.[10][11][12] **Laboratory Examination** **_CBC with differential_** - There are no absolute diagnostic findings as viral pneumonia may result in elevated, normal, or decreased WBC counts. However, viral etiology is less commonly associated with elevated WBC and "left shifts" of the differential than bacterial types of pneumonia. **_Chemistry panel_** - Useful for gauging the degree of dehydration, relative renal dysfunction, and dosing of renal excreted medications **_C-reactive protein_** - As a reactive phase reactant, the CRP level may be elevated with viral pneumonia, although this is not a specific or sensitive finding. **_ELISA_ **\_**- rapid antigen tests** \_- ELISA tests allow real-time data for a number of viral pneumonia pathogens. Commonly available ELISA tests include the following: - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - Influenza A and B - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) A caveat is that many viruses may be detected via ELISA in the presence of other known bacterial pathogens, and in some cases, the detection of a viral pathogen does not always indicate active disease. **_Gene amplification_** - First and second-generation PCR testing exists and may allow viral pneumonia etiology diagnosis within clinically relevant timing. Clinically available tests using PCR methodology include the following: - CMV - RSV - HPV - Coronal viruses \*\*_Cytological evaluation_ \*\* - No single cytological evaluation of patient tissue cells is entirely diagnostic for viral pneumonia. However, the generalization can be made that DNA viruses typically produce intra-nuclear inclusions, and RNA viruses typically produce cytoplasmic inclusions. **_Viral culture_** - Although viral cultures are the gold standard for the final diagnosis of viral pneumonia, there are limitations such as the following: 1. Viral cultures are routinely not available for 10 to 15 days, which limits them for acute clinical care decisions. 1. The cultures are very dependent on obtaining a valid specimen. 1. The success of delivering a viable specimen to the lab varies as many of the viruses have very specific transport requirements. 1. The fastidious nature of some viral pathogens limits the validity of a negative culture result. \_**Viral
