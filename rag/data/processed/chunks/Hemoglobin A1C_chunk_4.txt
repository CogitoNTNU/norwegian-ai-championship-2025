If any control rule is violated, patient testing must be halted immediately, appropriate corrective actions implemented, and testing resumed only after control results return to acceptable limits.[38] External quality assessment, or proficiency testing, offers an objective evaluation of laboratory performance. Participating laboratories receive blinded samples from an external organization, submit their results, and have them statistically analyzed and compared against peer groups. For HbA1c, the College of American Pathologists provides an accuracy-based external quality assurance program that promotes interlaboratory consistency and helps identify areas needing improvement.[39][36][40] Given that HbA1c exhibits low within-subject biological variation, typically \<2%, the ADA recommends that intralaboratory imprecision maintain a coefficient of variation (CV) below 2%, and interlaboratory CV should not exceed 3.5%.[41] Meeting these precision standards guarantees the reliability and clinical significance of test results. Laboratory safety is equally critical to overall testing quality. All personnel must follow infection prevention protocols, including proper use of personal protective equipment and safe handling of biological specimens. Maintaining a safe and compliant laboratory environment helps ensure consistent performance while minimizing risks of errors or exposure.[42] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes All clinicians caring for patients with diabetes mellitus need a thorough understanding of HbA1c and its clinical significance. In general, HbA1c reflects the average glucose concentration over 3 months. HbA1c is often used as an outcome measure to determine whether an intervention in a population is successful by demonstrating a decrease in HbA1c by a specific percentage. There is a movement within the medical community to shift away from using HbA1c as an exclusive standard of care test to assess patient response to treatment. The newest proposed methods include the estimated average glucose and the glucose time in range.[43] These methods use data obtained from continuous glucose monitors that record blood glucose levels around the clock. In addition, these methods can offer healthcare professionals a more accurate picture of the blood sugar average and fluctuations. However, these methods are not available to all patients on a widespread basis. According to ADA guidelines, HbA1c levels should be measured 2 times annually in stable patients and at least 4 times in patients with glucose fluctuations or those who have changed their diabetes treatment. HbA1c is one of the preferred diabetes diagnostic tests today. The blood draw can occur anytime, and no special handling requirements exist. However, to ensure that the A1c value is correct, clinicians must be aware of the
