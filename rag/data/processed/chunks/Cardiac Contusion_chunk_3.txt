of pericardiocentesis without imaging. Surgical drainage is required if the heart cannot be reached by a needle, clotted hemopericardium, intrapericardial bleeding, or thoracic conditions that make needle drainage difficult or ineffective.[8]. Definitive treatment to prevent further occurrence is achieved with a pericardial window, a surgical procedure performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential of cardiac tamponade would include other causes of obstructive or cardiogenic shock such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, Type A aortic dissection with extension into the pericardium or tension pneumothorax. In addition to the underlying causes of pericarditis discussed above, other causes of chest pain that should be considered when evaluating for pericarditis would include acute coronary syndrome, angina, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis or esophagitis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses also play a vital role in managing patients with acute pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. Their role includes medication adjustment and follow-up at the pericardial clinic. They not only co-manage patients with the physicians by monitoring patientsâ€™ symptoms and inflammatory markers but also help in contacting patients by phone, titrating dosages of medications, and arranging follow-up visits with an NP/PA in 3 months and with the physician every 6 months. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26956&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26956) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/acute-cardiac-tamponade/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26956) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26956/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26956) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK534806/figure/article-26956.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK534806/figure/article-26956.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Large Pericardial Effusion.
