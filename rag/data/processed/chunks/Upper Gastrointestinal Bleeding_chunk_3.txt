they would likely benefit from continuous telemetry monitoring for earlier recognition of hemodynamic compromise. - Outpatient - Most patients with GI bleeding will require hospitalization. However, some young, healthy patients with self-limited and asymptomatic bleeding may be safely discharged and evaluated on an outpatient basis. **Treatments** - Nothing by mouth - Provide supplemental oxygen if the patient is hypoxic (typically via nasal cannula, but patients with ongoing hematemesis or altered mental status may require intubation). Avoid non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to the risk of aspiration with ongoing vomiting. - Adequate IV access - at least two large-bore peripheral IVs (18 gauge or larger) or a centrally placed cordis - IV fluid resuscitation (with normal saline or lactated Ringer solution) - Blood grouping and cross match - Transfusions - RBC transfusion - Typically started if hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, including in patients with coronary heart disease[12][13] - Platelet transfusion - started if the platelet count is less than 50,000/microL - Prothrombin complex concentrate - Transfuse if INR is more than 2 - Medications - PPIs - Used empirically for upper GI bleeds and can be continued or discontinued upon identification of the bleeding source - Prokinetic agents - Given to improve visualization at the time of endoscopy - Vasoactive medications - Somatostatin and its analog octreotide can be used to treat variceal bleeding by inhibiting vasodilatory hormone release[14] - Antibiotics - Considered prophylactically in patients with cirrhosis to prevent translocation, especially from endoscopy - Anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents - Should be stopped if possible in acute bleeds - Consider the reversal of agents on a case-by-case basis dependent on the severity of bleeding and risks of reversal - Other - Consider NGT lavage if necessary to remove fresh blood or clots to facilitate endoscopy - Placement of a Blakemore or Minnesota tube should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability/massive GI bleeds in the setting of known varices, which should be done only once the airway is secured. This procedure carries a significant complication risk (including arrhythmias, gastric or esophageal perforation) and should only be done by an experienced provider as a temporizing measure. - Surgery should be consulted promptly in patients with massive bleeding or hemodynamic instability who have bleeding that is not amenable to any other treatment. - In case of diverticular bleeding colonoscopy with bipolar probe coagulation, epinephrine injection, or metallic clips are used. - If
