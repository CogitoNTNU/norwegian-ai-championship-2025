circulatory support is utilized as destination therapy. For patients who are not candidates for mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation, palliative care and continuous inotropic support should be considered and discussed with the patient (see **Image.** Congestive Heart Failure).[1][10] ## Differential Diagnosis When patients present with acute decompensated heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, there are many different diagnoses to consider based on the risk factors for heart failure alone. Also important to consider are other potentially life-threatening causes of heart failure. - **Sepsis:** Patients with sepsis are at risk of multiorgan system failure. Approximately 1 out of 3 patients with sepsis present with reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction reduced ejection fracture, and 1 out of 2 patients with sepsis have left ventricular or right ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis can result in significantly increased mortality. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with an increased mortality risk of 80%, and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with a 60% increased mortality.[11] - **Acute respiratory distress syndrome:** This condition is characterized by acute respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, which could potentially mimic flash pulmonary edema.[11] - **Neurological causes:** Hemispheric and hippocampal brain infarcts are associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Infarct of certain areas of the brain tissue can result in a sympathetic storm, and loss of vasomotor homeostasis precipitates neurogenic pulmonary edema (see **Image.** Key Features in the Pathophysiology of Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema).[12] - **Pulmonary embolism:** While a massive pulmonary embolism can cause acute cardiac dysfunction secondary to obstruction of blood flow, post-pulmonary embolism syndrome may also present with heart failure-type symptoms. Postpulmonary embolism syndrome and reduced exercise tolerance have been associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, arrhythmia, valvular dysfunction, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.[13] - **Acute coronary syndrome:** Acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction is a common cause of acute decompensated heart failure. ## Prognosis The diagnosis of heart failure alone can be associated with a mortality rate greater than many cancers. Despite advances made in heart failure treatments, the prognosis of the condition worsens over time, resulting in frequent hospital admissions and premature death. Results from one recent study showed that patients recently diagnosed with new-onset heart failure had a mortality rate of 20.2% at 1 year and 52.6% at 5 years. The 1- and 5-year mortality rates also increase significantly based on the patient's age. Another study had results
