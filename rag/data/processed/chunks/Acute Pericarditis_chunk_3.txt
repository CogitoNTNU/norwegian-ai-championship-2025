of idiopathic acute pericarditis. This form is the most commonly encountered in clinical practice, and extensive testing is rarely necessary unless there is specific clinical suspicion. ## Epidemiology Acute pericarditis is a prevalent form of pericardial disease and a common cause of chest pain. This condition often occurs in trauma patients, those with uremia, and individuals with malignant diseases, with a higher incidence in men.[21] ## Pathophysiology The pericardium serves several functions, including anchoring the heart within the thoracic cavity, forming a barrier against extrinsic infections, and facilitating dynamic interaction between cardiac chambers.[2] Notably, the pericardium is not necessary for survival, as cases have been reported of congenital complete absence of the pericardium, which has been incidentally discovered in asymptomatic individuals.[22] Despite potential concerns about increased cardiac mobility and displacement within the chest cavity, studies show these patients have comparable left ventricular ejection fraction and life expectancy to the general population.[23] The parietal layer’s rich innervation makes it highly sensitive to inflammation caused by infectious, autoimmune, or traumatic insults, often resulting in severe retrosternal chest pain, as seen in acute pericarditis.[1] This explains why over 90% of patients with pericarditis present with chest discomfort.[3] In cases of pericardial effusion, increased pericardial compliance allows the sac to dilate over time in response to slowly accumulating fluid, preventing compression of the cardiac chambers.[2] Consequently, the rate of fluid accumulation—and the resulting pressure changes—often has a greater impact than the volume in determining the hemodynamic effects on the heart. As a result, a relatively small pericardial effusion can lead to life-threatening tamponade if it accumulates rapidly, while a gradual process, such as malignancy, may allow a large pericardial effusion to develop over weeks before causing constrictive physiology in the cardiac chambers.[24] ## History and Physical Pericarditis is classified based on duration. Acute pericarditis lasts less than 4 to 6 weeks, incessant pericarditis persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks but resolves within 3 months, and chronic pericarditis extends beyond 3 months. Recurrent pericarditis refers to a new episode that occurs following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks between episodes.[23] Acute pericarditis accounts for approximately 5% of non-ischemic chest pain presentations in emergency departments and 0.1% of inpatient admissions.[23] The classical presentation involves central, severe chest pain that is pleuritic (which worsens with deep inspiration) and positional (which improves with sitting up and leaning forward). The pain may radiate to the trapezius ridges
