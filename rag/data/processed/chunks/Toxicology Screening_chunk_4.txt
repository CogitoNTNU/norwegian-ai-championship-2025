symptoms. Salicylate toxicity is another entity that can be a diagnostic challenge, and serum concentrations can help guide management. Urine tests give qualitative, presumptive results and need clinical interpretation Serum tests give quantitative, presumptive results and need clinical interpretation, in addition to potentially obtaining repeat sampling for certain poisonings. All toxicologic screening must be interpreted within the context of the patient presentation and should not routinely be a procedure as either exclusionary or confirmatory in a suspected exposure.[12] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Screening for toxic substances is now routine in most emergency departments. However, healthcare workers need to know that in many cases, the results of a toxicology screen are not immediately available, and clinical acumen is required. Toxicological screens take place for various reasons, including a forensic investigation, rape, use of illicit drugs, and drug overdose. While consent is recommended before such testing, some patients may not be able to provide consent for whatever reason. In such scenarios, as long as the clinician is acting in good faith for the benefit of the patient or a legal warrant, then testing can be done without consent. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=406&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=406) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/406/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=406) [![Common False Positive Pitfalls in Screening Contributed by Dr](/books/NBK499901/bin/tox__meds__pic.gif)](/books/NBK499901/figure/article-406.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK499901/figure/article-406.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Common False Positive Pitfalls in Screening Contributed by Dr. Seth Trueger ## References 1.
