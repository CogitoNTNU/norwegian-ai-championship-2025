Thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) - Mechanical thrombectomy (catheter or surgical) - Combination therapies 1. **Ongoing management:** PERT remains involved in monitoring and follow-up care, adjusting treatment as needed. Patients receive necessary interventions such as oxygen and hemodynamic support. Regular reassessment and monitoring for complications are conducted to ensure optimal patient outcomes. PERT is a new team approach to improving coordinated care in acute pulmonary embolism. It brings together specialists for rapid consultations and shared decision-making, improving communication and streamlining treatment. Studies indicate the feasibility of creating PERT teams, and the PERT consortium, a collaborative effort, is gathering data to assess its impact.[24][25][24] This data provides valuable insights into PERT's effectiveness in enhancing patient outcomes, care practices, cost-efficiency, and overall pulmonary embolism treatment knowledge. ## Preparation Before initiating the procedure, the practitioner should inspect the thrombolysis catheter delivery system to ensure all components are present. This procedure necessitates a fully operating catheterization laboratory. Healthcare professionals must adhere to proper sterile techniques, including drapes, gloves, and gowns. ## Technique or Treatment The EKOS system employs low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a specialized catheter to disaggregate fibrin strands within the clot.[22] This disaggregation increases the clot's permeability, enabling deeper penetration and enhanced efficacy of co-administered thrombolytic agents like rt-PA. Additionally, the ultrasound energy generates microstreaming effects, further facilitating drug transport within the clot.[26] It is essential to take a step-by-step approach to USAT. **Patient Selection and Preparation** Meticulous patient selection based on risk stratification and established inclusion/exclusion criteria is paramount for successful US-CDT. Informed consent and pre-procedural imaging, such as echocardiography, are mandatory steps. **Catheter Placement** Venous access is typically obtained via the common femoral vein. A guidewire and angiographic catheter navigate to the embolic occlusion in the pulmonary artery. The EKOS-IDDC replaces the angiographic catheter, allowing a precise positioning of the MSD-containing ultrasound transducers within the IDDC.[22] **Treatment Delivery** Simultaneous rt-PA infusion and saline coolant administration commence through the IDDC at precisely determined rates. Adjustments based on patient factors, such as weight and comorbidities, may be made to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize complications. Concomitant ultrasound delivery begins, utilizing specific protocols based on institutional guidelines and patient characteristics. Hemodynamic monitoring and continuous ECG are essential throughout the procedure to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy. The initial treatment duration varies depending on institutional protocols and individual patient factors, typically 12 to 24 hours. Rt-PA dose and ultrasound delivery adjustments are tailored to the
