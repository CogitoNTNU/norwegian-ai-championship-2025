Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represents a significant subset of HAP occurring in intensive care units (ICUs). This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of nosocomial pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of nosocomial pneumonia. - Review the evaluation of a patient with nosocomial pneumonia. - Outline the treatment and management options available for nosocomial pneumonia. - Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with nosocomial pneumonia.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represents a significant sub-set of HAP occurring in intensive care units (ICUs) and is defined as pneumonia that occurs more than 48 to 72 hours after tracheal intubation and is thought to affect 10% to 20% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.[1][2] ## Etiology Common pathogens of HAP and VAP include aerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g._Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Enterobacter_ spp, _Acinetobacter_ spp) and gram-positive cocci (e.g., _Staphylococcus aureus_ , which includes methicillin-resistant S. aureus, _Streptococcus_ spp). Differences in host factors and in the hospital flora of an institution affect the patterns of the causative pathogens.[2] **Risk Factors for Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) VAP** - Septic shock at the time of VAP - ARDS before VAP onset - Intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days of VAP - Hospitalization more than 5 days before the occurrence of VAP - Acute renal replacement therapy before VAP onset **Risk Factors for MDR HAP** - Intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days of HAP **Risk Factors for MRSA VAP/HAP** - Intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days of HAP or VAP **Risk Factors for MDR Pseudomonas VAP/HAP** - Intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days of HAP or VAP.[1][3][2] ## Epidemiology HAP occurs at
