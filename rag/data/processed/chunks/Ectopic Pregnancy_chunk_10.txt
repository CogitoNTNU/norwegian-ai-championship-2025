of pelvic inflammatory disease, prior ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery, or infertility treatments, should be educated about the symptoms and importance of early prenatal care. Emphasizing the need for timely pregnancy testing and early ultrasound evaluation can aid in the early identification of an ectopic pregnancy before complications arise. Women should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, dizziness, or fainting, as these could indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy requiring emergency care. Clinicians should also counsel patients on modifiable risk factors, eg, smoking cessation and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through safe sexual practices, as these can reduce the risk of tubal damage and future ectopic pregnancies. Patients undergoing fertility treatments or with known tubal abnormalities should be closely monitored in early pregnancy with serial β-hCG measurements and transvaginal ultrasounds to detect an ectopic pregnancy before rupture occurs. Providing emotional support and resources, including counseling services, can also help patients cope with the psychological impact of an ectopic pregnancy and any associated fertility concerns. Patients who seek medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy may need to discuss with their obstetrician which foods, supplements, and drugs to avoid when taking methotrexate, as there may be decreased efficacy due to adverse interactions with the drug. Methotrexate may increase immunosuppression when paired with other medications, among other potential adverse effects. Patients undergoing surgical interventions must adhere to the surgeon's recommendations to limit the risk of infection and other postoperative complications. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of ectopic pregnancy requires a well-coordinated, interprofessional approach to ensure accurate diagnosis, timely treatment, and optimal patient outcomes. When a woman presents to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, the healthcare team—including nurses, emergency physicians, obstetricians, advanced practitioners, and pharmacists—must work collectively to provide efficient, patient-centered care. Nurses play a critical role in the initial assessment by recognizing key symptoms and ensuring prompt evaluation by a physician. It is the responsibility of the clinician to consider ectopic pregnancy in any sexually active woman of childbearing age presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. Evidence-based tools can enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary testing or delays in care. By incorporating standardized protocols and leveraging clinical decision-making models, healthcare teams can improve efficiency and enhance patient safety. Interprofessional communication is essential in the management of ectopic pregnancy, particularly when consulting specialists such as
