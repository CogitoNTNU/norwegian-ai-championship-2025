It is a life-threatening complication of diabetes and is usually seen in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus. Rarely it may also occur in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. DKA is a state of a relative or absolute insulin deficiency that is worsened by hyperglycemia, dehydration, and acidosis. In most cases, the trigger is an infection, new-onset diabetes, or lack of compliance with treatment. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients suffering from this disorder in order to achieve the best outcomes. **Objectives:** - Review the etiology of diabetic ketoacidosis. - Describe the management of a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. - Summarize the abnormal laboratory parameters in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. - Explain the importance of improving care coordination among an interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by diabetic ketoacidosis.

It is a life-threatening complication of diabetes and typically seen in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus, though it may also occur in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. In most cases, the trigger is new-onset diabetes, an infection, or a lack of compliance with treatment. ## Etiology Diabetic ketoacidosis more commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes, though it can also occur in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes are also at risk. In both populations, catabolic stress of acute illness or injuries such as trauma, surgery, or infections may be a trigger. Common precipitating factors for DKA are non-compliance, new-onset diabetes, and other acute medical illness. The most common types of infections are pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Other conditions like alcohol abuse, trauma, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction can also precipitate DKA. Drugs that affect carbohydrate metabolisms, such as corticosteroids, thiazides, sympathomimetic agents, and pentamidine, may precipitate DKA. Conventional, as well as atypical antipsychotic drugs, may also cause hyperglycemia and rarely DKA.[1] SGLT2 inhibitors
