timed to coincide with His bundle refractoriness, either exactly at the time of His recording or within 35 to 55 milliseconds after His depolarization. Confirmation of His refractoriness is achieved by analyzing the surface QRS, which will show a fused beat, representing fusion between a fully paced QRS morphology and the QRS morphology seen during SVT. As a result, any ventriculoatrial conduction occurring after the HR-PVC cannot be mediated through the His-Purkinje system, suggesting the presence of an accessory pathway if the timing of the subsequent atrial beat following the HR-PVC is affected. Three scenarios can arise if the timing of the immediate atrial beat is altered, as mentioned below: - Advancement of the subsequent atrial activation - An atrial activation that occurs earlier than expected following an HR-PVC strongly suggests the presence of an accessory pathway, as the only way the impulse can reach the atrium prematurely in this context is via an alternative route that bypasses the His bundle. However, this finding alone does not confirm the accessory pathway’s involvement in the tachycardia. If the atrial activation sequence remains consistent with that observed during tachycardia, it strongly supports—but does not definitively prove—the accessory pathway’s participation in the tachycardia mechanism. - Delay of the subsequent atrial activation - A delay in atrial activation following an HR-PVC strongly suggests the presence of an accessory pathway and its participation in the tachycardia circuit. - Termination of the tachycardia without conduction to the atrium - Observing tachycardia termination without atrial conduction provides strong evidence for the presence and involvement of an accessory pathway. In this scenario, the His bundle is refractory and cannot conduct to the atrium, so the HR-PVC resets the rhythm only via the accessory pathway. However, in rare cases, an HR-PVC can delay or terminate AVNRT in the presence of a concealed nodoventricular or fasciculoventricular pathway. Here, the PVC blocks conduction through the His bundle but still reaches the ventricles via the accessory pathway, interrupting the reentrant circuit. This maneuver helps diagnose these concealed pathways.[11] **Atrial Overdrive Pacing during S**VT\*\*\*\* Atrial overdrive pacing (AOP) can be performed during SVT to differentiate atrial tachycardia from AVNRT and to distinguish AVNRT from junctional tachycardia. This maneuver involves pacing the atrium at a cycle length 10 to 40 milliseconds shorter than the TCL. The criteria for successfully interpreting an AOP response are similar to those used for VOP, as outlined below: -
