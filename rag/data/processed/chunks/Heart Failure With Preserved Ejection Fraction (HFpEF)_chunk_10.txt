(ECG):** Electrocardiography is routinely performed to evaluate patients with suspected heart failure to obtain information regarding rate, rhythm, and ventricular conduction.[1] **Chest radiography:** A chest x-ray is indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected HFpEF.[69] Chest radiography permits the assessment of the cardiac silhouette and heart size, pulmonary airspaces, vascular congestion, and other thoracic disease processes that may contribute to exertional dyspnea.[1] **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE):** Echocardiography is perhaps the most helpful tool in diagnosing HFpEF and is strongly recommended.[1] The need to categorize heart failure is considered an indication to perform TTE.[70] Determination of LVEF is the critical step in classifying heart failure and guides evidence-based therapeutic interventions.[1] If TTE is inadequate, other cardiac imaging studies such as cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac computed tomography, or radionuclide imaging can be considered.[1] However, TTE provides a wealth of information in a noninvasive manner, including the size, function, motion, and geometry of all cardiac chambers and valves, estimates of LVFPs, and estimates of atrial, systolic pulmonary artery, and central venous pressures. ## Treatment / Management **Therapeutic Interventions in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction** The goals of therapy for HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, prevent disease progression, reduce hospitalizations, and effectively manage underlying comorbidities. To this end, lifestyle and behavioral modifications are a cornerstone of therapeutic intervention. **Lifestyle interventions** Several studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[71] Exercise training, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, and weight loss improve functional status, exercise performance, rates of heart failure-specific hospitalization, and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[72] Caloric restriction and exercise training may have positive additive effects in patients with HFpEF, especially if they are older with concomitant obesity.[73] In addition to caloric restriction, at least 1 study has demonstrated that sodium restriction as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improves ventricular diastolic function and arterial elastance in patients with HFpEF and hypertension.[74] **Antihypertensive therapies** Diuretics, angiotensin receptorâ€“neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) are the preferred pharmacologic interventions if blood pressure is uncontrolled in a patient with HFpEF. The currently recommended blood pressure goal is below 130/80 mm Hg.[12] The nonrandomized Optimize-HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) registry demonstrated improved 30-day mortality and decreased hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared to no diuretic
