More than 90% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are fusiform. Intense inflammation, a thickened peel, and adhesions to adjacent structures characterize an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Angiography is now rarely performed for diagnostic purposes due to the superior image quality achieved with CT scans.[15] See **Images.** Ruptured Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Infrarenal Abdominal Aneurysm, Computed Angiogram. Magnetic resonance angiography is an option for patients with allergies to contrast media. An echocardiogram is recommended as many patients also tend to have associated heart disease. All patients require routine blood work, including a cross-match if surgery is necessary. Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart disease should be diagnosed by the relevant specialist and cleared for surgery. Cardiovascular risk factor modification should be achieved with smoking cessation, blood pressure control, statin, antiplatelet therapy, and healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise.[16] The previously advocated use of beta-blocker therapy has been disproven for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of AAA expansion and rupture.[17] ## Treatment / Management The treatment of unruptured AAA is recommended when the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.5 cm in men and 5.0 cm in women,[16][18] shows a rapid enlargement of greater than 0.5 cm over 6 months, or if it becomes symptomatic. Thus, according to recent guidelines from the European Society for Vascular Surgery, AAA repair is recommended if the aneurysm is symptomatic and greater than 4 cm, and has increased in size by greater than 1 cm/year, as measured by the inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter on ultrasound.[18] Open surgical repair using the transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach has been the gold standard. Endovascular repair using a femoral arterial approach is now applied for most repairs, especially in older and higher-risk patients. Endovascular therapy is recommended for patients with cardiovascular or other comorbidities that deem them at high risk for open surgery if they have suitable anatomy. A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm warrants emergency repair. If the anatomy is suitable, the endovascular approach for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm has shown superior results and survival rates compared to open repair, but the mortality rates remain high. See **Image**. Repaired Ruptured Aortic Aneurysm, Aortigram. The patient's age, the presence of renal failure, and the status of the cardiopulmonary system influence the risk of surgery.[19][20] In cases of horseshoe kidney, which often has multiple accessory arteries originating from the aneurysm, or when there is a concomitant iliac
