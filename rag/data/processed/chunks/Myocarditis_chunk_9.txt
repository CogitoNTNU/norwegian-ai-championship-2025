diuretics. The treatment strategy depends on the severity and hemodynamic status of the patient. In cases of acute heart failure, beta-blockers are withheld. Depending on the patient’s volume status, diuretics may be administered. In hemodynamically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, early initiation of RAAS inhibitors is advised. Once the hemodynamic and clinical status is optimized, beta-blockers can be introduced. In severe cases, mechanical circulatory support—such as an intra-aortic balloon pump or a LVAD—may be necessary.[19] Digoxin is generally avoided in the treatment of acute myocarditis due to the inflamed and irritable nature of the myocardium, which increases susceptibility to arrhythmias. Digoxin can elevate intracellular calcium levels and enhance myocardial excitability, potentially triggering or worsening ventricular arrhythmias. The risk of toxicity is heightened in these patients due to altered drug distribution, changes in renal function, and increased myocardial sensitivity. **Arrhythmia management** Acute myocarditis may be complicated by ventricular or atrial arrhythmias, as well as heart block. For patients with hemodynamically stable tachyarrhythmias and no signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, initiating a beta-blocker is recommended. Amiodarone and dofetilide may be considered for the treatment of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. If necessary, heart block is managed with a temporary pacemaker, followed by a permanent pacemaker if indicated. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator is indicated in the chronic stage, according to standard recommendations, once the acute illness has resolved. **Immunosuppressive therapy** Immunosuppressive therapy is not indicated for all patients with acute myocarditis. This is reserved for specific conditions, including eosinophilic myocarditis, giant cell myocarditis, granulomatous myocarditis (eg, sarcoidosis), and cases associated with autoimmune diseases or ICIs. Initial treatment typically begins with intravenous methylprednisolone (3–13 mg/kg/d boluses for 3 days), followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) with a tapering schedule. Management of giant cell myocarditis requires a combination of high-dose intravenous steroids, a calcineurin inhibitor (eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and azathioprine. Intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered in selected cases involving autoimmune, inflammatory, or antibody-mediated mechanisms. [5] **Other therapies** Anticoagulation is indicated in patients with documented atrial or ventricular thrombus or those with atrial fibrillation, in accordance with standard clinical guidelines. **Exercise limitation** In cases of acute myocarditis, it is recommended to restrict activity. Patients should refrain from participating in competitive sports for at least 3 to 6 months following an episode of acute myocarditis.[20] Further recommendations will depend on ongoing clinical assessments, echocardiograms, and Holter monitoring.[21][22] **Alcohol restriction** Alcohol consumption should be restricted to 1 drink per
