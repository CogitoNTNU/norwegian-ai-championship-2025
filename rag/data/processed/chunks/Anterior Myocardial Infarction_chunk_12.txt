failure. - **Killip class II:** This class represents mild signs of heart failure, such as bibasal rales, a third heart sound (S3), and raised JVP. However, despite these findings, the patient's clinical condition is stable. - **Killip class III:** This class denotes the presence of acute pulmonary edema. Patients in this category experience significant respiratory distress due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. - **Killip class IV:** This class represents cardiogenic shock, the most severe form of heart failure. Patients in this category exhibit profound hemodynamic instability, characterized by severe hypotension, reduced cardiac output, and end-organ hypoperfusion. In addition, they may have cold and clammy skin, altered mental status, and signs of peripheral vasoconstriction. ## Prognosis The in-hospital mortality rates associated with each classification are as follows:[27] - Killip class I: 6% - Killip class II: 17% - Killip class III: 38% - Killip class IV: 81% The anatomical location of occlusion of the LAD artery also predicts the 30-day and 1-year mortality in anterior myocardial infarction.

Cardiogenic shock complicating anterior MI is associated with higher hospital mortality when compared with inferior MI.[33] - **Left ventricular dysfunction:** AWMI involves a significant portion of the left ventricle, which can lead to impaired left ventricular function. This can result in decreased EF, compromised cardiac output, and an increased risk of heart failure. - **Left ventricular mural thrombus** is a frequent complication with systolic dysfunction due to anterior MI.[34][35] TTE can be used with high accuracy for diagnosis when suspicious of a thrombus.[36] This condition can lead to stroke or peripheral ischemia. - **Ventricular septal rupture** in the ventricular
