Changes in T wave morphology can indicate various benign or pathologic conditions affecting the myocardium. Proper knowledge of T wave morphology is essential to the successful evaluation and management of several conditions. This activity reviews the definition of an electrocardiographic T wave, explains how different clinical states can cause changes to T wave morphology, and highlights the role of educating interprofessional team members on the significance of T wave changes to improve patient care. **Objectives:** - Apply the physiology associated with the electrocardiographic T wave. - Determine normal T wave morphology on a standard electrocardiogram. - Identify common clinical diseases that cause changes in T wave morphology. - Communicate the importance of educating interdisciplinary team members regarding the significance of electrocardiographic T wave changes.

T-Wave Morphology). Understanding the differential diagnosis for T wave discrepancies is crucial to successfully and safely managing various cardiac pathologies. This topic summarizes the ECG T wave, including how it is defined and measured and how it may vary. ## Etiology **Normal T-wave Etiology** Normally, the T wave is formed at the end of the last phase of ventricular repolarization. Ventricular repolarization is when the ventricular myocytes return to their negative resting potential to depolarize again. While this phase of the cardiac cycle is rapid, an upright low amplitude broad hump following the QRS complex is seen in normal T wave morphology. **Abnormal T-wave Etiology** Abnormalities in the T-wave may represent variations of normal cardiac electrophysiology or signs of pathology. Tall T-waves (hyper-acute T waves) can be an early sign of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The morphology of the T waves can begin to broaden and peak within 30 minutes of complete coronary artery occlusion. It thus may be the earliest sign of myocardial infarction on the EKG. The T waves are broadened and peaked in the
