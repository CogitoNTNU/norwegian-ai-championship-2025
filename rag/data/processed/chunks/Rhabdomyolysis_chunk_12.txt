in the fluids. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels 6 mEq/L or above with or without ECG changes should be treated with an ampule of D50 followed by 10 units of regular insulin and IV sodium bicarbonate. In general, calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is commonly used in the emergency room with hyperkalemia. However, rhabdomyolysis, especially from trauma, is associated with late occurrences of hypercalcemia, so calcium should be used with caution in the management of hyperkalemia due to rhabdomyolysis. Symptomatic hypocalcemia, such as tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias, should be treated with IV calcium gluconate. Excessive calcium replacement can precipitate hypercalcemia during the recovery phase. Hyperuricemia from rhabdomyolysis should be managed with allopurinol and only if the serum uric acid is more than 8 mg/dL. Patients with volume overload, severe acidosis, uremia, and refractory hyperkalemia need hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient to correct the excess amount of electrolyte changes and rhabdomyolysis. **Other Supportive Care** Appropriate use of antibiotics and vasopressors is needed when concomitant sepsis is present. Malignant hyperthermia should be treated with dantrolene sodium. Steroids are used in inflammatory myopathies. Emergent orthopedic consultation is required in the management of compartment syndrome. DIC is managed with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelet transfusion. **Diet in Metabolic Myopathies** Dietary changes may improve symptoms associated with hereditary myopathies. Pain and fatigue associated with phosphorylase deficiency can be decreased with glucose and fructose supplementation. Frequent meals with a high carbohydrate, low-fat diet improve muscle pain and myoglobinuria from carnitine palmityl transferase deficiency. Other metabolic abnormalities may improve with different dietary interventions, and this should be examined closely with a dietician who specializes in such disorders. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis includes: - Hypothermia - Malignant hyperthermia - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - Sepsis - Inflammatory myositis - Inherited myopathies - Guillain-Barré syndrome - Hyperosmolar conditions ## Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials Preclinical studies have been conducted on the following interventions in rhabdomyolysis but have not proven effective: - Vasodilators - Antioxidants - Curcumin - Haptoglobin - Hemopexin - Hepcidin - _α_ 1-microglobulin. Gene therapy is being explored for treating inherited muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne and Becker. This includes various technologies such as read-through of early stop codons and exon skipping. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004, an NF-κB inhibitor) combines structural elements of salicylic acid and docosahexenoic acid and has also been tested in a phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial with some success ([NCT03703882](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03703882)).
