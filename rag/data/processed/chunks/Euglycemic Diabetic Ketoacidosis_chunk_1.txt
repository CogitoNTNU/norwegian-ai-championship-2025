SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, or ertugliflozin, can also directly result in EDKA.[2][3][9][10][11][12][13] EDKA may be more common in patients with diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors with lower body mass index and decreased glycogen stores.[1] Episodes can be triggered by surgery, infection, trauma, a major illness, reduced food intake, persistent vomiting, gastroparesis, dehydration, and reduced insulin dosages.[14] On rare occasions, a patient in DKA may receive enough extra insulin to bring the blood sugar under 250 mg/dL. ## Epidemiology Approximately 2.6% to 3.2% of DKA admissions are euglycemic.[9][15] DKA-associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors has rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.76 events per 1000 patient-years in patients with type 2 diabetes. Blau et al estimate that the SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of DKA in T2D patients by 7-fold.[16] Erondu et al estimate an overall incidence of DKA from SGLT2 inhibitor use of approximately 0.1%.[17] Data on patients with type 1 diabetes who presented with DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors showed rates varying from 5 to 12%; however, euglycemia was not present in all cases.[10] SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes. Data associated with other causes of EDKA is scarce. ## Pathophysiology The underlying mechanism of EDKA is secondary to a carbohydrate deficit resulting in generalized decreased serum insulin and excess counter-regulatory hormones like glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol. The increased glucagon/insulin ratio leads to increased lipolysis, increased free fatty acids, and ketoacidosis.[2][9][12] Ketone body production in EDKA is similar to DKA with acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (after acetoacetic acid reduction), and acetone (after acetoacetic acid decarboxylation). The resulting anion gap metabolic acidosis triggers respiratory compensation and the sensation of dyspnea, as well as nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. Volume depletion resulting from decreased oral intake, vomiting, and osmotic diuresis from glucosuria further exacerbates glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine elevations, worsening lipolysis and ketogenesis. Additionally, decreased gluconeogenesis by the liver occurs in fasting where hepatic glycogen is already depleted, or increased glucosuria by the kidneys contributes to EDKA.[3] Often, insulin-using patients do not recognize their symptoms as DKA because serum glucose is not elevated, and they may maintain or decrease their insulin dose.[1] If insulin dosing is adequate for glucose levels, it prevents gluconeogenesis, resulting in euglycemia. EDKA can be considered a “partially treated DKA” in this setting.[9] SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) are a newer class of antidiabetic drugs that increase the risk of
