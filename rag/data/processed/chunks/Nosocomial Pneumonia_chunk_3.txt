the pathogen's susceptibility. - For patients who are clinically improving and who do not have an identified pathogen, empiric treatment for _S. aureus or_ multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli can be stopped if these organisms have not been detected in culture from a high-quality specimen within 48 to 72 hours. - Patients who have not improved within 72 hours of starting empiric antibiotics should be evaluated for complications, other sites of infection, and alternate diagnoses. If the diagnosis of pneumonia appears certain, and the patient has risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens, additional pulmonary cultures should be done, and the empiric regimen should be expanded to cover additional resistant organisms.[2] Duration of antibiotic therapy in most patients with HAP or VAP of 7 days appears to be as effective as longer durations and may limit the emergence of resistant organisms. However, for patients with a severe illness, bacteremia, slow response to therapy, immunocompromise, and complications such as empyema or lung abscess, a longer duration of therapy is indicated.[2] ## Differential Diagnosis - Acinetobacter - Adenovirus - Bacterial sepsis - Burn wound infections - Clostridioides - Colitis - Croup - Enterobacter infections - Enterococcal infections - E-coli infections ## Prognosis Many studies have found that HAP is associated with an increased risk of death. The all-cause mortality associated with VAP ranges from 20 to 50% in different studies. Variables associated with increased mortality include: - The severity of illness at the time of diagnosis (eg., shock, coma, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome) - Bacteremia - The underlying co-morbidities[10] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) requires an interprofessional team of specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, anesthesiologists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers, including nurses and pharmacists, caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Without proper management, the morbidity and mortality from HAP and VAP are high.
