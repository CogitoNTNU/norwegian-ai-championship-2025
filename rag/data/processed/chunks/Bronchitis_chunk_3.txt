rhinovirus infections demonstrated the various locations within the respiratory system where the virus could be detected.[9] The inflammatory process triggers increased blood flow and cellular activity within the affected bronchi, resulting in heightened 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake when observed via positron-emission tomography (PET) scan.[17] Additionally, bronchial inflammation can stem from various triggers, with viral infections, allergens, and pollutants among the most common culprits. The inflammation of the bronchial wall leads to mucosal thickening, epithelial cell desquamation, and denudation of the basement membrane. In some instances, a viral upper respiratory infection can progress to a lower respiratory tract infection, resulting in acute bronchitis.[18] ## History and Physical Patients affected with acute bronchitis typically exhibit a range of symptoms, including a productive cough, feelings of malaise, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. Often, the most prominent complaint is the persistent cough, with an accompanying clear or yellowish sputum production. However, on occasion, the sputum can take on a purulent appearance. Purulent sputum does not necessarily correlate with a bacterial infection or necessitate antibiotic treatment.[19] Following an episode of acute bronchitis, the cough typically persists for 10 to 20 days, with a median duration of 18 days.[20] Occasionally, bronchitis cough may extend beyond 4 weeks. Paroxysms of cough accompanied by an inspiratory whoop or posttussive emesis should raise concerns for pertussis infection. In the early stages of infection, the symptoms of mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can often overlap, creating a challenge in distinguishing between both based solely on symptoms. Both conditions may present with common respiratory symptoms such as: - Cough: Initially, the cough may start as dry and irritating, but as acute bronchitis advances, it can transition to producing sputum. In acute bronchitis, this cough tends to persist for longer, often extending beyond 5 days. Approximately 50% of patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum.[21] Prolonged or forceful coughing may lead to chest wall or substernal musculoskeletal pain, usually self-limiting. - Mild fever: A low-grade fever may be present in both conditions, although it is more frequently associated with upper respiratory infections. The presence of high-grade fevers in the setting of acute bronchitis is unusual and warrants further diagnostic evaluation. - Fatigue and body aches: Mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can cause fatigue and general bodily discomfort. The differentiation between these 2 conditions becomes more apparent as the infection develops. If the symptoms predominantly affect the upper
