the physical examination better. - **Check patient weight:** The patient's weight and body mass index should be checked during each office visit. The information can be used to track response to treatment and the potential progression of heart failure or acute decompensated heart failure. Losing weight can also be a warning sign of worsening heart failure. - **Assessment of jugulovenous distension:** Jugulovenous distension can be a marker for fluid overload. The patient should lie at a 45-degree angle in bed to get an accurate assessment. - **Pulse:** Assess the regularity and strength of the pulse. - **Cardiac Examination** - Extra heart sounds (ie, S3 is associated with a worse prognosis), murmurs - Size and location of maximal cardiac impulse (can suggest ventricular enlargement if displaced) - Presence of right ventricular heave - **Pulmonary Examination:** Check respiratory rate, rhonchi, and rales (note: pleural effusions can mask and reduce breath sounds, and rhonchi or rales may be less prominent). - **Abdominal examination:** Check for ascites, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux. - **Lower extremity examination:** Assess for peripheral edema and skin temperature (cool lower extremities may suggest worse cardiac output).[1][6] ## Evaluation **Classification of Heart Failure** Classification is one of the key determinants of evaluating and treating heart failure. When a patient is in acute or decompensated heart failure, our focus is on expeditious identification and treatment of life threats. Different classification schemes are available when evaluating chronic heart failure. The classification scheme used to categorize the type and degree of heart failure is based on the presentation and affects the treatment and prognosis of the condition. Heart failure classification schemes are generally based on 1 of the following: - Anatomic findings (ie, heart failure with different degrees of ejection fraction) - The chamber of the heart involved (including functional) - Symptoms of the patient All heart failure patients should also be classified based on the American College Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) stages of heart failure, a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification.[1][6] **ACCF/AHA Stages of Heart Failure** The risk of heart failure defines the ACC/AHA stages of heart failure, the presence of active heart failure, and whether structural heart disease is present. The higher the classification, the greater the treatment and interventions the patient may require. - A: No structural heart disease present, high risk for heart failure, and asymptomatic - B: Structural heart disease present, asymptomatic - C: Structural heart
