of the following outcomesâ€”acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalizations for unstable angina or transient ischemic attack. However, adherence to CPAP therapy was low (2.78 hours per night), and the follow-up period was insufficient, both of which are significant limitations of the study.[65] In another observational cohort study with long-term follow-up, CPAP use was associated with a lower all-cause mortality rate among patients with severe OSA, particularly around years 6 to 7 of follow-up.[66] In a more recent study, patients with coronary artery disease and OSA who did not experience excessive sleepiness but exhibited greater changes in heart rate showed more benefit from CPAP therapy.[67] **Oral Appliance** For patients who are unable or unwilling to use CPAP, or those who lack reliable access to electricity, custom-fitted and titrated oral appliances or mandibular advancement devices (MAD) can help alleviate airway obstruction by advancing the lower jaw. This approach is typically most effective for candidates with appropriate dentition and mild-to-moderate sleep apnea. In a randomized clinical trial involving 126 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure was similar between CPAP and MAD after the first month of therapy. However, MAD was found to be superior to CPAP in improving quality of life measures.[68] More recently, another randomized clinical trial demonstrated similar long-term improvements for both CPAP and MAD in self-reported neurobehavioral outcomes over a 10-year follow-up.[69] The AASM and the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (AADSM) have developed guidelines for using MAD in patients with OSA.[70] The AASM/AADSM guidelines recommend the following: - Oral appliances can be considered as an alternative to no treatment for adult patients with snoring (without OSA) or those with OSA who do not tolerate CPAP therapy or prefer an alternative treatment. - When a sleep physician prescribes oral appliance therapy for an adult patient with OSA, a qualified dentist should use a custom, titratable appliance. - A follow-up with a qualified dentist is necessary to assess for dental-related adverse effects after initiating oral appliance therapy in adult patients with OSA. - Follow-up sleep testing is required to confirm the efficacy of the treatment. **Surgical Treatments** Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) involves the surgical removal of the uvula and tissue from the soft palate to create more space in the oropharynx.[71] This procedure is sometimes performed alongside a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. However, the long-term efficacy of UPPP is limited, with fewer than
