varying degrees of pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and may subsequently develop pulmonary hypertension. ARDS carries a high mortality, and few effective therapeutic modalities exist to combat this condition.[1][2] ## Etiology ARDS has many risk factors. Besides pulmonary infection or aspiration, extra-pulmonary sources include sepsis, trauma, massive transfusion, drowning, drug overdose, fat embolism, inhalation of toxic fumes, and pancreatitis. These extra-thoracic illnesses and injuries trigger an inflammatory cascade, culminating in pulmonary injury.[3] A lung injury prevention score helps identify low-risk patients, but a high score is less helpful.[1] Some risk factors for ARDS include: - Advanced age - Female gender - Smoking - Alcohol use - Aortic vascular surgery - Cardiovascular surgery - Traumatic brain injury [2] - Pancreatitis - Pulmonary contusion - Infectious pneumonia - Drugs (radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, amiodarone) ## Epidemiology Estimates of the incidence of ARDS in the United States range from 64.2 to 78.9 cases/100,000 person-years. Twenty-five percent of ARDS cases are initially classified as mild, and 75% as moderate or severe. However, a third of the mild cases progress to moderate or severe disease.[3][4] Approximately 10 to 15% of patients admitted to the intensive care units and up to 23% of mechanically ventilated patients meet the criteria for ARDS.[5] A literature review revealed a mortality decrease of 1.1% per year from 1994 through 2006. However, the overall pooled mortality rate for all the studies evaluated was 43%.[6][7] The mortality of ARDS is commensurate with the severity of the disease: 27%, 32%, and 45% for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. ## Pathophysiology ARDS represents a stereotypic response to various etiologies. ARDS progresses through different phases, starting with alveolar-capillary damage, a proliferative phase characterized by improved lung function and healing, and a final fibrotic phase signaling the end of the acute disease process. The pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cellular damage is characterized by inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, and increased alveolar-capillary permeability, leading to alveolar edema and proteinosis. Alveolar edema, in turn, reduces gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia. A hallmark of the pattern of injury seen in ARDS is that it is not uniform. Segments of the lung may be more severely affected, resulting in decreased regional lung compliance, which classically involves the bases more than the apices. Intrapulmonary differential in pathology results in a variant response to oxygenation strategies, such as increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which may improve oxygen diffusion in affected alveoli but may cause volutrauma and
