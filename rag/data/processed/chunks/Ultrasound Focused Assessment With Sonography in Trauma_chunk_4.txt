induction and have direct bronchodilatory properties.\*\*\*\* In contrast, desflurane can increase bronchial smooth muscle tone and airway resistance at higher concentrations; therefore, clinicians avoid this in patients with asthma.[15] Although propofol can blunt reflex bronchoconstriction of the airways, its bronchodilation is inferior to volatile anesthetics. However, compared to etomidate and thiopental, propofol has lower airway resistance.[16] Ketamine has direct bronchodilatory effects, blunts airway reflex bronchoconstriction, and is often the agent of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients. However, it also causes increased secretions, which can complicate airway management.[17] Sevoflurane and isoflurane are generally used to maintain anesthesia in patients with asthma. Given their heightened airway responsiveness, children with asthma require a more cautious approach. Anesthesia providers must minimize airway manipulation, use specific anesthetic agents that are less likely to trigger bronchospasm, and often premedicate with bronchodilators to prevent airway issues during induction and emergence. When possible, experts recommend IV induction instead of inhaled induction for children at risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events. Guidelines also recommend cuffed endotracheal tubes and less invasive airway devices such as mask ventilation or a supraglottic airway when possible.[18] Noninvasive airway management, such as supraglottic airway placement, is associated with a decreased risk of postoperative hypoxemia and coughing compared to endotracheal tube use in adults.[[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537327/#article-17923.r14) When comparing the supraglottic airway to an endotracheal tube for airway control in children, the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events was lower with the supraglottic airway. However, there was no statistically significant difference in bronchospasm or aspiration between the 2 groups. Propofol is a suitable induction agent that avoids volatile agents. Ketamine is suitable for the hemodynamically unstable pediatric patient. For children with poorly controlled asthma, delaying surgery for improved asthma management is ideal. If unable to postpone, experts recommend bronchodilators and steroids before and after surgery. IV magnesium and continuous ÃŸ2-agonist therapy may be necessary. Aminophylline is not a recommended treatment option, and antibiotics are not required for asthma exacerbations unless a known bacterial cause exists.[[19]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_34890494)[[20]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_28546381)[[21]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_34514673) Neuromuscular-blocking drugs (NMBDs) improve conditions during intubation by minimizing airway resistance. Clinicians often avoid depolarizing NMBDs in children, given the risk of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible undiagnosed myopathy. The use of topical and inhaled lidocaine applied to prevent airway irritation and bronchoconstriction before endotracheal intubation is controversial, as evidence suggests an increased incidence of desaturation using this technique.[[16]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537327/#article-17923.r16)[[22]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_22211867) If heart rate or blood pressure control is necessary in
