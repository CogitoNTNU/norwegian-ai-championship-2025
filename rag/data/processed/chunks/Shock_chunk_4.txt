provide a benefit compared to other MCS devices and should not be routinely used but may still play an important role in patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defects, or when other MCS devices cannot be placed. - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is indicated in patients with poor oxygenation not expected to improve with alternative temporary mechanical support devices rapidly. - In properly selected patients not likely to recover from cardiogenic shock without long-term MCS support, a ventricular assist device can be implanted as a bridge to recovery, bridge to bridge, bridge to transplant, or destination therapy. - Cardiac transplantation may be performed in suitable candidates not expected to recover after MCS device implantation may be the only hope for meaningful long-term recovery. However, it remains a very limited option owing to the low number of available hearts. Short-term mechanical circulatory assist - IABP (Intra-aortic balloon pump) - Non-IABP percutaneous mechanical devices - ECMO **IABP- Intra-aortic balloon pump** - Most commonly used and least expensive of all mechanical support devices. - Easy and rapid insertion. - It is the device with which interventional cardiologists are most familiar. Some of the other indications apart from cardiogenic shock include intractable angina, adjunctive therapy in high risk or complicated angioplasty, refractory heart failure as a bridge to future therapy, intractable ventricular arrhythmias as a bridge to therapy. Mechanism: Blood is displaced into the proximal aorta by inflation during diastole, during systolic, rapid balloon deflation occurs, creating a vacuum effect and reducing the afterload. Contraindications include severe aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, uncontrolled sepsis, uncontrolled bleeding disorders. The patient needs to be on therapeutic anticoagulation to avoid thrombosis, and heparin is the most common anticoagulation used. Daily labs, including creatinine, platelet count, and hemoglobin, need to be checked. Uncommon events like cholesterol embolization and balloon rupture are rare occurrences. Limitations of IABP include variable effect on total coronary blood flow, no mortality benefit, modest hemodynamic support.[12] **Non-IABP percutaneous mechanical devices** _Left ventricular assist devices_ 1\. Left ventricle to aorta- percutaneous transvalvular left ventricular assistance device (LVAD) 2\. Left-atrium-to-aorta assist device- 3\. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support with the use of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). _Right ventricular assist device_ -The LVAD system is available in 2 different versions (2.5 and 5.0). The larger version needs surgical implantation, whereas the smaller motion could be placed percutaneously.-This has an axial flow pump that revolves at a
