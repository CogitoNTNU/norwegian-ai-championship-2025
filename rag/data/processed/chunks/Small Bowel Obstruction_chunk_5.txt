to dehydration, hypovolemia, and metabolic disturbances. - Bacterial translocation - The thickened, inflamed, and ischemic bowel wall becomes more permeable, allowing bacteria, predominantly _Escherichia coli_ , to translocate into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity. This can result in peritonitis, bacteremia, and systemic infection. - Ischemia and infarction - Prolonged obstruction increases intraluminal pressure to a point where arterial blood flow is compromised. This results in ischemia, necrosis, and, if untreated, perforation. Perforation leads to peritonitis, which can progress to sepsis and death.[19] - Systemic effects - The combination of fluid loss, bacterial translocation, and ischemia activates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increasing the risk of septic shock and multiorgan failure. **Distinction Based on Obstruction Location** - Proximal SBO - Characterized by significant vomiting, minimal abdominal distension, and rapid onset of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances - Distal SBO - Associated with more pronounced abdominal distension, delayed vomiting, and slower progression of systemic complications **Functional Obstruction** In functional SBO, peristalsis fails due to metabolic disturbances, neural inhibition, or inflammation (paralytic ileus). While there is no mechanical barrier, the resulting pathophysiology is similar, with stasis leading to fluid sequestration, bowel distention, and bacterial overgrowth. ## Histopathology The histopathological changes in SBO evolve in response to the obstruction's severity, duration, and underlying cause. The diagnosis can be confirmed with histology in a unit with expertise in this pathology area.[15] Early stages are marked by mucosal edema, hyperemia, and increased intraluminal pressure, impairing venous return and causing fluid accumulation in the mucosa and submucosa. This fluid results in villous edema and mild inflammatory cell infiltration, primarily by neutrophils and lymphocytes. Capillary dilation and vascular engorgement in the lamina propria lead to hyperemia and increased permeability. As the obstruction progresses, ischemia exacerbates tissue damage, causing mucosal ulceration and sloughing of the epithelial layer, compromising the mucosal barrier. Bowel wall inflammation intensifies with polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and bacterial translocation, particularly by _E coli_ , increases the risk of peritonitis or bacteremia. Prolonged ischemia leads to necrosis, initially affecting the mucosa and extending to the muscularis propria and serosa. The bowel wall thickens with fibrin deposition and inflammation, and in severe cases, full-thickness necrosis appears as coagulative necrosis, where cellular details are lost and tissues exhibit hypereosinophilic staining. In cases of strangulated obstruction caused by herniation, volvulus, or adhesions, hemorrhagic necrosis and venous congestion are commonâ€”with the bowel wall darkened and thickened due to blood accumulation.
