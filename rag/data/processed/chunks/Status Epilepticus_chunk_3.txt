definitive efficacy of this agent is unknown and should not be used as first-line therapy.[18] Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam and clobazam, have been extensively used when treating ESES. A group of researchers treated 29 children with ESES with oral high-dose diazepam (1 mg/kg; maximum of 40 mg) and noted a reduction of the spike-wave index from 76.7% to 40.8% within 24 hours. These patients received 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam for 3 weeks after the initial high dose before gradual tapering. Reversible side effects—sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, hypotonia, paradoxical aggravation—occurred in approximately one-quarter of patients.[19] Larrieu et al first described the utility of clobazam in 1986.[20] Only rare reports of precipitation of absence status in ESES have appeared associated with clobazam.[21] Caraballo et al demonstrated that clobazam was effective in 5 of 117 patients and in combination with other agents in 86 of 117 patients.[22] A few specific antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can worsen seizure control in ESES and require withdrawal in the presence of worsening drop or absence seizures.[23][24] Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone) have been utilized in different therapeutic regimens, both as long-term continuous therapy lasting for months or intermittent monthly high-dose treatment. Buzatu et al retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of a 21-month regimen of hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg/day during the first month, 4 mg/kg/day during the second month, 3 mg/kg/day during the third month, 2 mg/kg/day for next 9 months, and slow taper during remaining of the treatment period) in 44 patients with a positive response in 34 patients during the first 3 months of the treatment, and with normalization of EEG in 21 patients. However, among 34 responders, 14 patients had a subsequent relapse. Higher intelligence and developmental quotients and shorter disease duration before initiating treatment were associated with a positive outcome. Due to side effects, 7 patients discontinued treatment early.[25] Chen et al reviewed the efficacy of a different regimen of corticosteroids that used a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone with oral prednisone for 6 months. This study has results reporting a high response rate but a high relapse rate at 1-year follow-up.[26] Due to fear of side effects from long-duration corticosteroid therapy, methylprednisolone pulse therapy (15 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days consecutively, once a month for 4 months) has also been used successfully.[27] A recent review calculated a response rate, defined as an improvement in the EEG or cognition, of 80%
