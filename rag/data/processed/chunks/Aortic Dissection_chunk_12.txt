can exceed 30% to 40% if not promptly treated with endovascular or surgical intervention. - Long-term outcomes - The 5-year survival rate for type B dissections is approximately 75% to 85%, but patients are at increased risk of aortic aneurysm formation, redissection, and rupture over time. Regular imaging surveillance and blood pressure control are critical to improving long-term prognosis. **Prognostic Factors** Several clinical and anatomical factors influence the prognosis of patients with aortic dissection. Time to diagnosis and treatment is paramount, particularly for type A dissections, as delays in intervention significantly increase the risk of fatal outcomes due to rapid disease progression and life-threatening complications. The extent and location of the dissection also play a crucial role in prognosis, with dissections involving the aortic arch or extending into the abdominal aorta carrying a higher risk of complications, including organ malperfusion, neurologic deficits, and increased surgical complexity. The presence of complications such as pericardial tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, stroke, or malperfusion syndromes is strongly associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality. Patient demographics and comorbidities, such as advanced age, history of hypertension, connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome), and chronic kidney disease, further contribute to a worse prognosis. In particular, patients with genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome have an elevated risk of redissection and aneurysm formation, necessitating closer monitoring and follow-up. Hemodynamic status at presentation is a critical prognostic factor. Hypotension or shock at the time of diagnosis indicates severe complications, such as aortic rupture or tamponade, and is linked to a markedly increased risk of mortality. Similarly, surgical and postoperative complications, including neurologic deficits like stroke or spinal cord ischemia, renal failure, or prolonged intubation, are associated with elevated perioperative mortality and adverse long-term outcomes. Even after successful initial treatment, patients remain at risk for long-term complications, including redissection and aneurysm formation. Recurrent dissection or aneurysmal dilation at the site of the initial dissection or other segments of the aorta is a significant concern, particularly in patients with residual dissection in the descending aorta or those with connective tissue disorders. Chronic aortic enlargement due to a residual false lumen can lead to progressive dilation, rupture, or the need for reintervention. Furthermore, these patients are at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, particularly if the dissection involves the coronary arteries or aortic valve. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may
