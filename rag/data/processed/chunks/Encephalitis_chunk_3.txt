Management Due to the rarity of the disease and lack of clinical trials, the definitive treatment for GAE is not clear at this time. A combination of drugs is used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend combination treatment with pentamidine, sulfadiazine, flucytosine, and either fluconazole or itraconazole. Multiple other regimens are also recommended. Chronic Acanthamoeba meningitis was successfully treated in 2 children with a combination of oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and ketoconazole. Resection of brain lesions may help as well.[12][13][14] Similarly, the optimal treatment of PAM is unknown; reports range from 9 to 30 days. For the treatment of PAM amphotericin B, both intravenously and intrathecally is recommended, but considering the fulminant course of the disease and high mortality rates, a combination of drugs is generally used. Reports include the use of amphotericin in addition to rifampin, fluconazole, miltefosine, and azithromycin. Posaconazole has also been shown to be effective in mouse models of disease. It may replace fluconazole as the azole of choice, although further studies are warranted to confirm this choice.[12][13][14] Only one case of GAE due to _Sappinia_ has been reported in humans (attributed to _S diploidea_).[15] The patient was a previously healthy male farmer who engaged in handling livestock. The disease manifested as headache, vomiting, blurry vision, and loss of consciousness following a sinus infection. Histopathology of a single 2 cm focal lesion in the posterior left temporal lobe demonstrated trophozoites (40 to 60 microns in diameter) with two nuclei. The infection was likely acquired by inhalation. He was treated with a combination of flucytosine (2.75 g, 4 times a day for 25 weeks), itraconazole (200 mg/day), intravenous pentamidine isethionate (300 mg/day for 6 weeks), and azithromycin (250 mg/day for 31 weeks). The treatment resulted in complete recovery. ## Differential Diagnosis The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to acute bacterial meningitis, and CSF parameters are also alike. Therefore, obtaining an epidemiological history in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis but negative cultures and failure to improve cannot be emphasized enough.[8] The differential diagnosis of GAE includes bacterial brain abscesses, tuberculosis, Nocardia, CNS aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and _Histoplasma_. Toxoplasmosis and cysticercosis, as well as CNS lymphoma, should be considered.[8] ## Treatment Planning [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK430754/table/article-17437.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK430754/table/article-17437.table0/?report=objectonly) Table 1.
