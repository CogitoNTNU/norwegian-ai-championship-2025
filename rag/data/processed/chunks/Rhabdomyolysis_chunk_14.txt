and physical exertion. - The symptoms of genetic myopathies can sometimes be treated by dietary changes. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Many studies on rhabdomyolysis management lack good quality randomized control trials. Rhabdomyolysis can have significant morbidity on the patient, and the key is education on prevention. When patients are discharged, the nurse and pharmacist play a vital role in educating the patient and the family on the causes of muscle breakdown and how to prevent them. College and high school students need to be educated regarding heat-related injuries and the importance of hydration. Patients with rhabdomyolysis may also need to enter a rehabilitation or a physical therapy program to regain muscle mass and recover joint function. Many patients take months to recover the muscle mass even after recovery, and some even have residual pain for a few years. Finally, the pharmacist should warn the public about the risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with recreational drugs, alcohol, or prescription medications. Lastly, care coordination is pivotal in ensuring seamless and efficient patient care. Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. This coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care that prioritizes the well-being and satisfaction of those affected by rhabomyolysis. With an interprofessional healthcare team approach to diagnosis and care that includes primary clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, patients with rhabdomyolysis can achieve good outcomes and avoid the long-term sequelae of this condition. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28509&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28509) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/kidney-health/rhabdomyolysis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28509) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28509/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28509) ## References 1.
