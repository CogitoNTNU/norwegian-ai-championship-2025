promptly treat potential infections and thromboembolic disease. Imaging during acute exacerbations may reveal ground-glass opacities and consolidations.[63] IPF primarily affects the lungs, with no observed involvement of other organs. The disease progression varies among patients, with some remaining stable for years after diagnosis, others experiencing rapid decline, and some having periodic exacerbations that contribute to declining lung function and increased mortality. Baseline lung function at diagnosis, the presence of comorbidities (especially coexisting emphysema and pulmonary hypertension), smoking history, low body mass index, and older age are associated with a worse prognosis in IPF. Monitoring the disease progression typically involves regular evaluations, usually every 3 to 6 months or more frequently as needed, to assess for worsening symptoms such as dyspnea and oxygenation. This monitoring process includes assessing symptoms such as dyspnea and oxygenation, as well as conducting a 6-minute walk test and PFTs to provide more objective data on the disease's progression.[64] Palliative care with a focus on progressive end-stage IPF is highly advised. Studies have demonstrated that palliative care improves symptom management, health-related quality of life, and end-of-life care for individuals with IPF, leading to reduced incidence of critical events, hospitalization, and overall healthcare expenditures.[65] Given the association of mechanical ventilation with poor outcomes, it is essential to address goals of care early in the process.[66] **Investigational treatments:** In recent years, there has been an effort to discover drugs that can prevent or halt the formation of fibrosis and fibroblast. A translational study in mouse models demonstrated that aerosolized T3 thyroid hormone can inhibit lung fibrosis by enhancing mitochondrial function in epithelial cells.[67] Similarly, resmetirom, a thyroid hormone agonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first treatment for liver fibrosis due to fatty liver disease. This approval suggests a potential role in fibrosis treatment, but further studies in humans with IPF are needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety.[55] ## Differential Diagnosis The following conditions are part of the differential diagnosis for IPF: - Occupational lung diseases, including pneumoconiosis and asbestosis - Aspiration pneumonitis - Bacterial and viral pneumonia - Farmer's lung and other forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis - Fungal infection - Lung cancer - _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia - Sarcoidosis - Pulmonary edema - Connective tissue diseases ## Prognosis IPF is a progressive disorder with a median survival time of around 5 years. However, about 20% of patients are estimated to survive without
