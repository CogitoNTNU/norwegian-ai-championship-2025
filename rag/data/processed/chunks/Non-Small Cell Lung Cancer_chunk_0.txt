It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. It is estimated that there are 225,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States annually, and approximately 160,000 die because of lung cancer. It is interesting to note that lung cancer was a relatively rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century. Its dramatic rise in later decades is attributable primarily to the increase in smoking among both males and females. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of lung cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Describe the pathophysiology of lung cancer. - Review the causes of lung cancer. - Summarize the different types of lung cancers. - Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lung cancer.

It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. It is estimated that there are 225,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States annually, and approximately 160,000 people die because of lung cancer. It is interesting to note that lung cancer was a relatively rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century. Its dramatic rise in later decades is mostly attributable to the increase in smoking among both males and females.[1][2] ## Etiology Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer. It is estimated that 90% of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking.[3] The risk is highest in males who smoke. The risk is further compounded with exposure to other carcinogens, such as asbestos. There is no correlation between lung cancer and the number of packs
