angiodysplasia is the cause of lower GI bleed, thermal therapy (eg, electrocoagulation, argon plasma coagulation) is done. ## Differential Diagnosis Few diagnoses mimic GI bleeding. Occasionally, hemoptysis may be confused for hematemesis or vice versa. Ingestion of bismuth-containing products or iron supplements may cause stools to appear melanic. Certain foods/dyes may turn emesis or stool red, purple, or maroon (such as beets). Other differentials to consider in GI bleeding are: **Upper GI Bleeding** - Peptic ulcer disease - Esophagitis - Gastritis and Duodenitis - Varices - Portal hypertensive gastropathy - Angiodysplasia - Dieulafoy lesion - Gastric antral valvular ectasia - Mallory-Weiss tears - Cameron lesion - Aortoenteric fistulas - Foreign body ingestion - Upper GI tumors - Hemobilia - Hemosuccus pancreaticus **Lower GI Bleeding** - Diverticulosis - Angiodysplasia - Infectious colitis - Ischemic colitis - Inflammatory bowel disease - Colon cancer - Hemorrhoids - Anal fissures - Rectal varices - Dieulafoy lesion - Radiation-induced collitis ## Prognosis Limited studies exist regarding the prognosis following GI bleeding. For upper GI bleeds, in-hospital mortality rates are approximately 10% based on observational studies. This rate holds steady up to 1-month post-hospitalization for GI bleed. Long-term follow-up of patients with UGIB shows that at three years after admission mortality rates from all causes approach 37%. Mortality rates were higher in women than in men when adjusted for age, which differs from that of lower GI bleeding. Patients with multiple hospitalizations for GI bleeding carry higher mortality rates. The long-term prognosis was worst in patients who suffered from malignancies and variceal bleeds. The prognosis was worse with advancing age.[15] For lower GI bleeds, all-cause in-hospital mortality is lowâ€”less than 4%. Death from LGIB itself is rare, with most in-hospital mortality occurring from other comorbid conditions. Increased risk of death corresponded to increasing age (as seen in cases of UGIB as well), comorbid conditions, and intestinal ischemia. Other negative prognostic factors include secondary bleeding (onset of bleed after being hospitalized for a different condition), patients with pre-existing coagulopathies, hypovolemia, transfusion requirement, and male sex. Not surprisingly, the lowest risks of mortality are associated with more benign causes of LGIB such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and colon polyps.[16] Long-term follow-up studies in patients with LGIB are not common. ## Complications Gastrointestinal bleeding if not managed timely or properly can lead to serious consequences. Following complications can occur in a patient with upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding: -
