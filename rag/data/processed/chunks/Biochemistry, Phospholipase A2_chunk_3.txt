in the body. The function of the enzyme in adipocytes is important to the regulation of lipolysis and prostaglandin production. Increased enzymatic activity results in the formation of prostaglandin E, which causes decreased intracellular cAMP and increased adiposity. **Platelet-Activating Factor Aacetylhydrolase** Macrophages predominantly synthesize platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase in the body. Protein synthesis of the enzyme increases during the process of monocyte differentiation into macrophages. The enzyme is more catalytically active in LDL particles rather than HDL particles, suggesting that their role in interacting with HDL may include a reservoir function when more enzyme is needed to interact with LDL. The body of evidence surrounding the proper function of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase has changed considerably over time. Initially, the thinking was that it played a crucial role in the prevention of the development of atherosclerosis; however, recent evidence suggests that its function is atherogenic. Therefore, the enzyme is now considered to be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.[1][5][3][6] ## Pathophysiology **Secretory PLA** Secretory PLA plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many conditions that involve inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis, and tumor cell growth. The pathophysiology of ARDS and asthma involve two mechanisms related to normal respiratory physiology. Normal expression of secretory PLA results in increased leukotrienes, which serve as potent chemokines, resulting in leukocyte attraction and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines. This role has been established in the pathogenesis of asthma. Another mechanism that contributes more to the pathophysiology of ARDS involves secretory PLA degradation of the lung surfactants phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, resulting in further respiratory inflammation and alveolar collapse. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis also correlates with increased expression of secretory PLA. The mechanism proposed involves hydrolyzation of phospholipids in LDL particles that results in macrophage uptake and subsequent intimal lipid accumulation. Studies have shown a positive correlation between blood levels of secretory PLA and coronary artery disease as a result of atherosclerosis of coronary vessels from oxidative damage. **Cytosolic PLA** Disturbance in the normal function of cytosolic PLA prevents the inflammatory response to take place, which results in resistance to a variety of inflammatory-mediated pathologies, including anaphylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, fatty liver disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Research has revealed cytosolic PLA as playing a noteworthy role in the pathogenesis of many forms of cancer, including estrogen-depending breast cancer, adenocarcinoma
