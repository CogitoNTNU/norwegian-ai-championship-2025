However, excessive fluid can exacerbate aortic wall stress, so caution is warranted. If hypotension persists, vasopressors (eg, norepinephrine) can be administered to maintain perfusion, but these agents should be used carefully as they can increase the force of ventricular contraction and potentially worsen the dissection. **Definitive Treatment Based on AAD Classification** The type and location of the dissection—classified by the Stanford or DeBakey systems—determine the need for surgical or medical intervention. - **Stanford type A dissections (involving the ascending aorta)** - Urgent surgical intervention - Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the risk of catastrophic complications such as cardiac tamponade, severe aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or aortic rupture. Surgical mortality varies from 5% to 20%. Surgical intervention involves: - Excision of the intimal tear - Remove the primary tear site and obliterate entry points into the false lumen to prevent further propagation. - Aortic replacement - Placement of a synthetic graft to reconstitute the aortic architecture - Aortic valve assessment and repair/replacement - If the dissection extends into the aortic root or involves the aortic valve, valve repair or replacement with a prosthetic valve may be necessary. The decision to perform a Bentall procedure (combined aortic root and valve replacement) is based on the extent of root involvement. - Management of aortic arch involvement - AADs that extend into the aortic arch are among the most complex to manage surgically, given the need for cerebral protection and the higher risk of neurologic complications, including paraplegia. - **Stanford type B dissections (involving the descending aorta)** - Medical management - Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed with aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control. The goal is to reduce aortic wall stress, prevent progression, and monitor for complications. - Indications for intervention - Endovascular or surgical intervention is indicated for: - Malperfusion syndromes - Dissections causing ischemia to organs such as the kidneys, intestines, or limbs require urgent intervention. - Aortic rupture or impending rupture - Rapid expansion, recurrent pain, or signs of contained rupture mandate immediate repair. - Interventions - Endovascular stent-grafting - Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is preferred for complicated type B dissections.[2][21][22] TEVAR involves placing a stent-graft to seal the dissection entry tear and exclude the false lumen, promoting healing and remodeling of the aorta. TEVAR is associated with significantly lower morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical repair. However, patient selection is key,
