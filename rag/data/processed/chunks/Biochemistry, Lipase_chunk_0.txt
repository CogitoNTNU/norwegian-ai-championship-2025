There are expressed and active in multiple tissues; for example, hepatic lipases are in the liver, hormone-sensitive lipases are in adipocytes, lipoprotein lipase is in the vascular endothelial surface, and pancreatic lipase is in the small intestine. [1] Lipases in pancreatic secretions are responsible for digestion and hydrolysis of fat and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Understanding the lipase function is crucial for the pathophysiology of fat necrosis and acute and chronic pancreatitis. Also, lipases play an essential role in the mechanism of some cholesterol-lowering medications. This review will explore the lipase enzyme's function, pathophysiology, and clinical significance.[2] ## Molecular Level The lipases belong to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes. They work by employing chymotrypsin-like hydrolysis, which uses a histidine base, a serine nucleophile, and aspartic acid.[3][4] ## Function Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in triglycerides.[5] Lipases are present in pancreatic secretions and participate in fat digestion and metabolism. They play an essential role in lipid transport and serve individual functions in several tissues, including hepatic lipase in the liver, hormone-sensitive lipases in the adipocytes, lipoprotein lipase in the endothelial cells, and pancreatic lipase in the small intestine. Hepatic lipase in the liver degrades the triglycerides that remain in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). Hormone-sensitive lipase is found within fat tissue and is responsible for hydrolyzing the triglycerides stored within adipocytes. Lipoprotein lipase is found in the vascular endothelial cells and is responsible for degrading triglycerides that circulate from chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Pancreatic lipase is found within the small intestine and is involved in degrading dietary triglycerides.[6] The LDL ultimately serves to transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissue. Hepatic lipase plays a crucial role in developing and delivering low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The LDL is formed by modifying the IDL in the peripheral tissue and liver by hepatic lipase. These LDL particles are taken up, or endocytosed, via receptor-mediated endocytosis by target cell tissue. The LDL ultimately serves to transport cholesterol from
