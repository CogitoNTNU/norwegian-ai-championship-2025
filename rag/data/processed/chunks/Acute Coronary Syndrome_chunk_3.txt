life choices. A critical aspect of STEMI and ACS timely treatment depends on adequate emergency medical services availability and training. Another crucial step of ACS control and prevention is education about lifestyle modification including smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and dietary modifications. Only through this multi-prong approach can practitioners control this high mortality disease. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes ACS is associated with very high morbidity and mortality and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, cardiologist, internist, pharmacist, and primary caregivers. The condition is primarily managed by the cadiologist but the prevention is managed by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. The patient should be urged to stop smoking, maintain a healthy body weight, exercise regularly and remain compliant with the medications. The outlook for patients who are treated promptly is good but those with severe disease and non-compliance have high morbidity including premature death.[13][14][15] (Level V) ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20023&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20023) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/acute-coronary-syndrome/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20023) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20023/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20023) ## References 1.
