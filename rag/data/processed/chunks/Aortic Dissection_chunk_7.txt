and determine the appropriate management. **Clinical Evaluation** As previously discussed, the initial assessment begins with a focused history and physical examination. Once a patient with a possible aortic dissection is identified, further workup begins. **Electrocardiogram** Although an electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely performed to evaluate chest pain, its findings are often nonspecific in an acute aortic dissection. ST-segment changes may suggest myocardial ischemia, particularly if the dissection extends to involve the coronary arteries. The presence of ECG findings consistent with an acute myocardial infarction occurs in 8% of cases of acute aortic dissection. However, a normal ECG does not exclude a dissection, and a high index of clinical suspicion should be maintained based on presenting symptoms and history. **Chest Radiography** A chest x-ray may reveal a widened mediastinum (>8 cm), abnormal aortic contour, pleural effusion, or loss of the aortic knob, suggesting aortic dissection. However, up to 20% of patients may have a normal chest x-ray, so the absence of findings does not rule out the diagnosis. Additional suggestive findings include: - Left apical cap - Pleural effusion - Deviation of the esophagus or trachea - Depression of the left mainstem bronchus - Loss of the paratracheal stripe **Laboratory Evaluation** Laboratory tests are useful adjuncts but are not diagnostic for acute aortic dissection. They help assess the clinical status and organ function. Important laboratory tests include: - D-dimer: Elevated D-dimer levels (>500 ng/mL) are highly sensitive to acute aortic dissection due to increased fibrinolytic activity from forming a false lumen. However, D-dimer lacks specificity and should not be used as a standalone test, but it may help rule out the condition in low-risk patients. - Cardiac biomarkers, including troponin: Mildly elevated troponin levels may be seen, especially if there is coronary artery involvement or myocardial infarction. - Complete blood count: Leukocytosis is common but nonspecific. A drop in hematocrit may suggest intraluminal blood loss. - Renal function tests: Elevated creatinine levels can indicate renal ischemia from dissection involving the renal arteries. - Serum lactate levels: Elevated lactate levels may indicate poor perfusion or tissue ischemia due to branch vessel involvement. - Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain assay: An elevated smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SM-MHC assay is specific for acute aortic dissection. The SM-MHC assay is a rapid 30-minute test that can detect circulating SM-MHC protein. However, smooth muscle proteins can only detect the dissection after it occurs, and they are
