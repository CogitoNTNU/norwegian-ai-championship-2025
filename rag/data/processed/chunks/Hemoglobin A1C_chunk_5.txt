causes of false-positive and false-negative results. As many patients with diabetes mellitus are treated in outpatient settings, diabetes care nurses must understand HbA1c results and know when to refer patients to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Pharmacists must also fully understand and interpret this test, as they are involved in glycemic management, medication, agent selection, dosing, and monitoring. The nurse and pharmacist must inform the treating clinician regarding any changes in HbA1c and verify patient medication compliance. HbA1c is a valuable tool for managing diabetes mellitus and other glycemic control disorders, but its effectiveness is maximized within an interprofessional healthcare team environment. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22729&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22729) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22729/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22729) ## References 1.
