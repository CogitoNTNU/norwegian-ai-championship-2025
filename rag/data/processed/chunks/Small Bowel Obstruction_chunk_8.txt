suggest tissue hypoxia, indicating ischemia or necrosis of the bowel, particularly in the context of strangulated obstruction. - Amylase/lipase - Although these tests are typically used to evaluate pancreatitis, they may be elevated in cases of SBO if there is associated pancreatic involvement or strangulation of a segment of the small intestine. - Blood cultures - If there is suspicion of peritonitis or sepsis due to bowel perforation or bacterial translocation, blood cultures may be warranted to guide antibiotic therapy. **Radiographic Imaging** Radiologic evaluation is central to confirming the diagnosis of SBO and assessing its location, severity, and complications. **Abdominal X-Rays** The initial imaging study of choice is usually a plain abdominal radiograph (x-ray). This study can reveal characteristic findings such as: - Dilated loops of small bowel - Air-fluid levels are visible on upright images, indicating proximal bowel distention. - Absence of gas in the colon - This finding suggests a complete obstruction, especially if the obstruction is distal to the small intestine. - Step ladder pattern - This pattern of air-fluid levels in the small intestine can indicate obstruction. - Signs of perforation - Free air under the diaphragm on an upright chest x-ray suggests perforation. Plain radiography has poor sensitivity, with rates ranging from 50% to 80%. While radiography can serve as an initial screening test for detecting air-fluid levels or free air in the abdomen, it does not provide sufficient imaging to identify the cause, extent, or complications of SBO. A small bowel diameter greater than 6 cm is concerning and indicates a severe obstruction that may pose a high risk for compromised viability. **CT Scan** A CT scan of the abdomen is considered the gold standard for diagnosing SBO. CT scans are more sensitive than x-rays for detecting SBO, particularly in assessing the underlying cause. This study can help differentiate between simple and complicated (strangulated or ischemic) SBO. This imaging can be enhanced using intravenous contrast, provided the patient has normal kidney function and no contraindications. Key findings include: - Bowel distention - This appears similar to that on x-rays but is more detailed and can help quantify the extent. - Transition point - This is the location of the obstruction, which is critical in planning surgical or conservative management. - Bowel wall thickening - This finding is suggestive of ischemia, inflammation, or infection. - Mesenteric stranding - In cases of bowel ischemia or perforation,
