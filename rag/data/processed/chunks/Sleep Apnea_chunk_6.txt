precipitating factors. Ideally, these patients need to be evaluated by a sleep physician. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes For patients with central sleep apnea, a multidisciplinary approach is important to the patient's overall care. This may include a cardiologist in patients with heart failure to appropriately optimize treatment. The role of respiratory therapists and nurses is important in educating patients on proper techniques to use various machines and masks for non-invasive ventilation, which is a cornerstone of management in patients with central sleep apnea. Pharmacists form an integral component in evaluating and identifying any medications that may contribute to the disease progression. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing patients with central sleep apnea. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=141286&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=141286) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/central-sleep-apnea/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=141286) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/141286/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=141286) [![Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas](/books/NBK578199/bin/Polygraph__Apnea.gif)](/books/NBK578199/figure/article-141286.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK578199/figure/article-141286.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas.
