minimum, the information obtained from an ABG includes pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and serum bicarbonate (HCO3). It should be noted that the HCO3 obtained from an ABG is a calculated value and may, therefore, be inaccurate. Analysis of an ABG should instead be performed using a measured HCO3 obtained from a basic metabolic panel. Oxygenation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaO2. Hypoxemia is defined as a PaO2 less than 60 mmHg. Ventilation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaCO2. Hypercapnia is defined as a PaCO2 greater than 45 mmHg. Information from the ABG can also be used to differentiate acute from chronic respiratory failure by evaluating the renal response to PaCO2. In respiratory acidosis, the kidneys respond by increasing the absorption of HCO3 in the proximal convoluted tube. As this is a slow process, the magnitude of HCO3 absorption in acute respiratory acidosis is less than the magnitude of HCO3 absorption in chronic respiratory acidosis. This difference allows for the distinction between the chronicity in acute and chronic respiratory failure.[21] **Capnometry** Capnometry, the measurement of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas, may be qualitative or quantitative. Colorimetric capnometry is a qualitative measure of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas that relies on the color change of a pH-sensitive indicator. Infrared capnometry is a quantitative measure of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas that relies on measuring the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Quantitative capnometry provides more information than qualitative capnometry.[22] In the non-pathological state, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the end of expiration, or end-tidal pCO2 (PETCO2), approximates the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood (PaCO2). The PaCO2 is typically 2 to 3 mmHg greater than the PETCO2. In the pathological state, where gas exchange is impaired, the difference between the PaCO2 and PETCO2 becomes greater than 3 mmHg due to increased dead space ventilation.[23] Values obtained from quantitative capnometry can be plotted graphically and displayed as waveform capnography. Analysis of these waveforms allows for detecting pathological states (i.e., apnea, bronchospasm, hyperventilation, and hypoventilation).[24] **Radiography** Various imaging modalities are available for the evaluation of respiratory failure. Such options include plain films, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, angiography, and ultrasonography.[25] **Pulse Oximetry** Pulse oximetry relies on spectrophotometry, the process of identifying the composition of a substance via measurement of the absorption of specific wavelengths
