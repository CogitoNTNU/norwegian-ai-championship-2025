24 hours. Healthcare providers should treat blood glucose \<60 mg/dL to achieve normoglycemia. The brain is dependent on oxidative pathways that require glucose for metabolism, and the metabolic demand of the brain is high; therefore, hypoglycemic episodes can decrease the brain's ability to repair. However, hyperglycemia is hypothesized to decrease reperfusion due to the oxidation of nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms and subsequent loss of vascular tone. Moreover, increased acidosis also plays a part, possibly due to injury to lactic acid-sensing channels. Capes et al showed that hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients increases 30-day mortality and is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke conversion.[53] - **Nutrition:** Early enteric feeding should be encouraged. For patients with dysphagia, use a nasogastric tube to promote enteric feeding. If there is concern that the patient may have swallowing difficulties for a prolonged period (more than 2 to 3 weeks), placing a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is recommended. Early feeding has been demonstrated to have an absolute reduction in the risk of death.[54] - **DVT prophylaxis:** Intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended for all immobile patients unless contraindications exist. The European Stroke Organization recommended acutely intermittent pneumatic compression for all immobile stroke patients. They also recommended low-dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis if the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding.[55][56] - **Depression screening:** Screening for depression should be considered after an acute ischemic stroke. Rates of post-stroke depression range from 18% to 33%. Risk factors are female sex, large strokes, a stroke affecting the frontal areas, and poor social support. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the best medications for post-stroke depression.[57][58] - **Cerebellar/Cerebral edema:** Cerebral edema occurs with acute ischemic stroke, first due to cytotoxic edema with cell swelling, followed by vasogenic edema when the blood-brain barrier is lost. The degree and volume of cerebral edema correlate well with the size of the stroke. Cerebral edema is not significant clinically in lacunar infarction. However, cerebral edema may become symptomatic, resulting in worsening of the stroke symptoms and worse in impairment of consciousness due to herniation. Cerebral edema peaks in 3 to 5 days after an ischemic stroke.[59] Cerebellar edema complicates cerebellar infarctions, and clinicians must know that these patients can rapidly decompensate. The increased ICP can cause obstructing hydrocephalus on the fourth ventricle or cause transtentorial herniation of the superior vermis and downward cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Signs include change or worsening mental status, decreased
