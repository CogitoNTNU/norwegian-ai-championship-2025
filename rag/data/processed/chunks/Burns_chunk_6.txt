occurs to produce heat-generating and conserving activity, ie, shivering, teeth chattering, vasoconstriction, cellular non-shivering thermogenesis. With severe burns, the critical temperature is decreased. When the innate mechanisms of combating hypothermia are combined with a general anesthetic, patients are significantly predisposed to hypothermia. General anesthesia is associated with both redistribution of heat from the core to the periphery and inhibiting the central thermoregulatory control making even healthy patients prone to hypothermia from the subsequent vasodilation. The critical means to ensure optimal thermoregulation for all burn patients include forced-air warming, fluid warming, and raising the operating room temperature. An accurate means of temperature measurement, such as a distal esophageal or rectal temperature probe, becomes essential for the perioperative management of severely burned patients.[4][11][12] ## Technique or Treatment **Fluid Resuscitation** Proper fluid resuscitation is recommended for burns involving >15% TBSA to prevent complications associated with the burn shock phase. A lack of early and aggressive fluid resuscitation in severe burns (>15% TBSA) will result in hypovolemic shock. The intravascular volume becomes depleted due to fluid shifts and increased capillary permeability. Delaying fluid resuscitation for more than 2 hours after the initial severe burn is associated with an appreciable increase in mortality. Of note, when calculating TBSA, only second- and third-degree burns are factored into the calculation of TBSA; first-degree burns are excluded from TBSA estimation. Intravascular volume repletion helps mitigate the resultant hypovolemia complications, such as tissue hypoperfusion and the associated reflexive vasoconstriction. Burns less than 15% TBSA can be appropriately managed with oral fluids or a maintenance intravenous fluid rate of 1.5 times normal.[1][2] The accepted crystalloid for fluid resuscitation is lactated Ringer solution due to the worsening metabolic acidosis associated with a large volume of normal saline (0.9%) infusions required for severe burns. Patients with severe burns are predisposed to metabolic acidosis due to decreased kidney perfusion during burn shock. Although several formulas exist for calculating the recommended amount of volume needed for fluid resuscitation, the clinician should not lose focus of the clinical markers of appropriate resuscitation and taper fluid resuscitation to feedback from objective findings such as:[1][2] - Urine output goal: 0.5 to 0.1 mL/kg/h - Fractional excretion of sodium: \<1% suggests hypovolemia - BUN-to-creatinine ratio: >20 suggests hypovolemia - Echocardiogram: assessment of stroke volume and ejection fraction - Arterial blood gas: base deficit \<5 suggests hypoperfusion in the absence of carbon monoxide poisoning When medical professionals fail to
