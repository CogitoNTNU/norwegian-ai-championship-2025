count (HELLP) syndrome. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[HELLP syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22684)," for more information on diagnostic laboratory studies. Proteinuria, defined as 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a urinary protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 or greater, is no longer essential for diagnosing preeclampsia and may be absent before the onset of seizure activity; this laboratory test is still included during evaluation.[2][17] Other essential laboratory studies include a hepatic panel to assess liver function, a complete blood count to quantify platelet counts, and a basic metabolic profile to assess kidney function. Platelet levels of 100,000/Î¼L or less and liver transaminase levels more than 2 times the upper limit of normal with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain are also associated with preeclampsia with severe features. Laboratory tests to exclude differential diagnoses for seizures should also be considered, including urine drug screens, complete metabolic panels, or toxicology screens. Brain natriuretic peptide testing can help confirm the diagnosis and guide management, as it correlates well with heart function and fluid levels in cases where fluid overload is suspected.[1][11] **Additional Diagnostic Studies** Imaging studies, including chest x-rays and obstetric ultrasounds, can also be utilized to assess maternal pulmonary edema and fetal well-being, respectively. For patients with neurological symptoms, such as persistent headaches or vision changes despite treatment for hypertension, neuroimaging is recommended to rule out conditions like stroke or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.[11][16][10] Neurologic studies, including electroencephalography (EEG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral angiography may be conducted following seizures. EEGs in women with eclampsia frequently show abnormalities such as slow waves or spikes, typically in the occipital region. These abnormal EEG findings typically persist even with seizure prophylaxis using magnesium sulfate.[11] Abnormal neuroimaging findings, including cerebral edema, infarction, and hemorrhage, may also be demonstrated. Routine neuroimaging is not recommended for all patients with eclampsia, but it is advised in cases involving focal neurological signs, recurrent seizures, or prolonged coma. Imaging is also warranted for atypical cases, such as seizures occurring before 20 weeks of pregnancy or more than 48 hours postpartum, as these may indicate other underlying neurological conditions that require intervention.[11] ## Treatment / Management **Management of Eclampsia** Eclamptic seizures are a medical emergency and require immediate treatment to prevent mortality for the patient and fetus. The management approach for eclampsia should balance immediate supportive measures, seizure control, and the prevention of recurrent
