submucosal vessels. Other similar conditions should be differentiated from Dieulafoy lesion based on presenting signs and symptoms, endoscopy, and angiography. These include diverticulosis, telangiectasias, vascular neoplasms, mucosal spider nevi, and connective tissue disorders. ## Prognosis The mortality and morbidity of Dieulafoy lesions have significantly reduced to 8.6% since the development of endoscopy.[8] Hemostasis is successfully achievable in 80 to 85% of the cases treated with endoscopy. ## Complications Due to the subtle nature of the disease, it is often missed as a diagnosis initially and may result in delayed treatment resulting in adverse complications. The most common complication is massive spontaneous gastrointestinal hemorrhage that may be fatal if left untreated. Intermittent blood loss may lead to iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and, in severe cases, hemodynamic instability. In some cases, it may lead to the worsening of pre-existing co-morbidities. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients need to minimize the risk factors for Dieulafoy lesion by avoiding the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alcohol. Regular follow up with a gastroenterologist is necessary to monitor the condition and prevent a recurrence. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Most cases of Dieulafoy lesions go undiagnosed due to lack of awareness, acute onset of signs and symptoms, intermittent bleeding pattern, and difficulty in visualization on endoscopy. On endoscopy, Dieulafoy lesion may be difficult to diagnose due to its small size or the presence of normal-appearing surrounding mucosa.[9] Excessive blood in the GIT may also prevent visualization and further delay diagnosis. For these reasons, physicians and endoscopists should consider this condition as a differential diagnosis for intermittent or massive GIT bleeding. Radiologists should also be aware of the subtle nature of this condition that may be missed in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding. Once diagnosed, endoscopy should be the preferred treatment since it has replaced invasive surgery due to better health care outcomes. During the evaluation of the lesion, it is essential to determine the focal point of the bleeding for the management of future episodes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=117755&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=117755) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/dieulafoys-lesion-causing-gastrointestinal-bleeding/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=117755) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/117755/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=117755) [![Image ](/books/NBK562267/bin/Gray532.gif)](/books/NBK562267/figure/article-117755.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK562267/figure/article-117755.image.f1/?report=objectonly) The celiac artery and its branches, Liver; Left Lobe, Stomach, Right Gastroepiploic artery, Greater omenta, Sleen, Caudate Lobe, Pylorus, Gall-bladder Henry Vandyke Carter, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons ## References 1.
