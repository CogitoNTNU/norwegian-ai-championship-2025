2 seizures have occurred despite magnesium therapy, lorazepam 4 mg IV over 3 to 5 minutes is recommended.[11] Other alternative seizure interventions that may be utilized include: - **Sodium amobarbital** : 250 mg IV in 3 minutes [2] - **Diazepam** : Loading dose of 10 mg IV over 2 min, then maintenance dose of 40 mg in 500 mL normal saline for 24 hours, followed by 20 mg in 500 mL for the next 24 hours [19] - **Phenytoin** : Loading dose of 10 mg/kg initially in 30 minutes, then 2 hours later administer 5 mg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg IV over 10 minutes for 24 hours from the last seizure [19] - **Fetal monitoring** : During seizures, fetal heart rate decelerations, bradycardia, or tachycardia may occur secondary to maternal hypoxia and hypercapnia. Uterine contractions can increase but usually resolve once the maternal condition stabilizes.[2][11] - **Postpartum management** : Magnesium sulfate is recommended to prevent eclamptic seizures in postpartum patients with new-onset hypertension and neurologic symptoms (eg, headaches and blurred vision) or preeclampsia with severe features.[1] - **Magnesium sulfate monitoring** - **Therapeutic levels** : Elevated levels of magnesium sulfate can cause adverse events, including respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. Therefore, clinicians should monitor for clinical signs of toxicity, including decreased urine output, absent deep tendon reflexes, and respiratory depression. Clinicians should assess magnesium serum levels every 4 to 6 hours in patients with renal impairment due to the increased risk of toxicity.[2][11] - **Toxicity management** : In patients demonstrating signs of magnesium toxicity (eg, respiratory depression) or the serum level is >9.6 mg/dL, the magnesium sulfate infusion should be discontinued, and calcium gluconate 10% solution (10 mL IV) can be administered over 3 min as an antidote.[11] - **Magnesium sulfate duration** : Continuing magnesium sulfate administration is recommended for 24 hours after delivery or the last seizure.[11] - **Antihypertensive management** - **Blood pressure control** : Treatment of severe hypertension is associated with decreased maternal-fetal morbidity. Experts recommend gradually reducing and maintaining blood pressure between a systolic of 140 and 160 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 90 and 110 mm Hg without causing a sudden drop that may compromise placental perfusion. Management of a hypertensive crisis usually involves rapid-acting IV first-line medications, such as hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine.[3][11] - **Hydralazine** : Hydralazine is typically administered with a dosage of 5 to
