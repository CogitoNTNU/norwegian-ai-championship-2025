risk.[30] The radiation dose of a CT scan ranges from 1 mSv to 27.0 mSv. (1 mSv= 1 mGy.) Natural/environmental exposure is approximately 3 mSv per year.[44] An adult abdominal CT exposes the patient to 10 mSv; however, during a neonatal abdominal CT, the exposure is 20 mSv.[31] Contrast agents may cause allergic reactions, usually mild, involving itching rash; however, severe reactions can occur, such as bronchospasm and anaphylactic reaction.[47][48][49][50] The probability of a fatal reaction is about 1 in 100,000. If the patient has an iodine allergy, steroids must be given to counteract any potential side effects if contrast must be given.[51] Kidney failure due to the iodine contrast material can occur in 2% to 7%, with greater risk in those with preexisting kidney disease.[52][53][54][55][56] Contrast-induced nephropathy, when severe, can require dialysis to clear the dye. In non-serious conditions, adequate hydration before the post-contrast injection will eliminate contrast from the body. ## Patient Safety and Education When a single scan is performed, the estimated radiation obtained is similar to the person's natural exposure to the environment for several months to a few years. If a patient is pregnant, the radiation dose is small and usually does not affect the fetus. However, the study is done only if it provides a significant benefit. Using a spiral or helical CT scan, the radiation dose is reduced compared to a sequential CT scan.[57] A low-emission CT scan allows minimal radiation exposure with the benefit of early cancer detection in smokers. A CT scan is ideal for trauma cases as it can detect organ injury in a fast and reliable manner. The use of intravenous contrast highlights the vascular structures and can identify the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhages and spontaneous hematomas. For gunshot wounds, the CT scan provides details of the injury, which can not be done with an MRI due to the gunshot's metallic nature.[58] The CT scan has several advantages over magnetic resonance imaging. The CT scan can be used safely in patients with pacemakers and programmable pumps or shunts because it will not affect the device setting. Claustrophobic patients usually can not complete the MRI study; however, they feel comfortable inside the CT scan as the procedure is quicker and noiseless. ## Clinical Significance CT scans provide information as close to real-time that allows for the proper management of multiple diseases. Before the invention of the CT scan, patients with
