research is essential to assess its efficacy fully.[38][39][40] Recognizing individuals who have previously undergone surgical annuloplasty often have a reduced mitral valve area due to the presence of the annuloplasty ring is crucial. Given that more than 1 TEER device is typically needed to reduce MR effectively, the procedural team must exercise caution to prevent a subsequent increase in diastolic inflow gradients. In postsurgical mitral valve repair cases, the posterior mitral valve leaflet is often resected, resulting in a shorter and smaller posterior leaflet that can prove more challenging to grasp during the TEER procedure. An alternative strategy involves grasping the anterior and posterior sections of the annuloplasty ring when the posterior leaflet tissue length is insufficient. However, expertise with this technique is somewhat limited. Furthermore, the visibility of the posterior leaflet is often restricted due to an annuloplasty ring, making leaflet grasping particularly challenging during TEER. In these scenarios, there is an elevated risk of device entanglement, especially in the presence of artificial chords.[41] Preprocedural TEE examination also helps predict the repair difficulty (see **Table 5**. Echocardiography Predictors of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair Difficulties).[8][42][43] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table4/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table4/?report=objectonly) Table 5. Echocardiography Predictors of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair Difficulties. ## Indications The edge-to-edge leaflet repair device is the only recommended intervention to treat MR. Still, there are many emerging technologies, including but not limited to neo-cords, transcatheter mitral valve repair, and rings. The following are currently the indications for the edge-to-edge repair: - Moderate to severe primary MR - Moderate to severe secondary MR - Symptomatic heart failure - High or prohibitive risk for surgery - Favorable anatomy - Life expectancy >1 year [44][45] ## Contraindications A few contraindications to catheter intervention with the edge-to-edge leaflet repair device include the following: - Inability to tolerate anticoagulation - Active endocarditis of the mitral valve - Rheumatic mitral valve disease - Intracardiac, inferior vena cava, or femoral venous thrombus - Severe mitral annular calcification involving leaflets - Presence of significant cleft or perforation in mitral valve leaflets - Mitral valve stenosis [46][47][48] ## Equipment The following supplies are needed to perform a transcatheter edge-to-edge leaflet repair procedure: - The edge-to-edge leaflet repair device - Transeptal puncture kit including catheters, needles, and a radiofrequency wire - Fluoroscopy machine - Code cart with a defibrillator - Sterile gown - Sterile drape - Anesthetic - Transesophageal echocardiography, preferably with 3D imaging capability - Transducers and equipment
