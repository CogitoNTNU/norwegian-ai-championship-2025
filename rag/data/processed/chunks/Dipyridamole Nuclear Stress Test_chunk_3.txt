significant obesity have not undergone thorough evaluation, although a general guideline of a maximum dose of 70 mg has been recommended. There is no need to dose adjust this medication for those patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in geriatric patients using this medication as its oral formulation is a Beers List medication, although the extended-release form combined with aspirin is not on the Beers List.[15] **Pediatric Dosing** Pediatric use of this medication has limited data, but guidelines suggest 2.0 to 6.0mg/kg/daily for its antiplatelet effect. Given the limited data, dipyridamole is not a first-line agent for the use of antiplatelet therapy for pediatric and adolescent patients. ## Adverse Effects **Most Commonly Reported Adverse Effects** [16] 1. Chest pain (20%) 1. Angina exacerbation, IV (19.7%) 1. Abnormal ECG (15.9%) 1. Headache, IV (12.2%) 1. Dizziness (12%) **Other Reported Adverse Effects** **Generalized System Effects** - Diaphoresis, fatigue, increased appetite, increased thirst, malaise, and weakness **Cardiopulmonary Effects** - Arrhythmia, bronchospasm, cough, chest pain, cardiomyopathy, flushing, heart attack, ischemic electrocardiogram changes, lowered blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, palpitations, and shortness of breath. **Central Nervous System Effects** - Ataxia, changes in vision, dizziness, general weakness, headache, hypertonia, numbness/tingling, tinnitus, tremor, and vertigo **Dermatologic System Effects** - Hypersensitivity reaction, injection site reaction, pruritis, skin rash, and urticaria **Gastrointestinal System Effects** - Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea, eructation, flatulence, tenesmus, and vomiting **Psychiatric System Effects** - Depersonalization **Lymphatic System Effects** - Edema **Musculoskeletal System Effects** - Arthralgia, back pain, claudication, generalized weakness, myalgia, and rigidity ## Contraindications The main contraindications for the application of dipyridamole are previous hypersensitivity reactions and thrombocytopenia. **Disease-related Concerns** - Cardiovascular disease: Use requires caution in patients with hypotension, unstable angina, and/or recent MI; may enhance exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. - Hepatic impairment: Use requires caution in patients with hepatic impairment. **Concurrent Drug Therapy Issues** - Antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants: Use requires caution in patients on other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation. **Dosage Form Specific Issues** - Injection: Severe adverse reactions have infrequently occurred with IV administration. Use the IV dosage form with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease or unstable angina. Testers should have aminophylline ready in case of urgency or emergency with IV use. ## Monitoring Current guidelines do not suggest routine laboratory testing for therapeutic monitoring of dipyridamole. There are no required scheduled laboratory evaluations for associated toxicities. The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology does
