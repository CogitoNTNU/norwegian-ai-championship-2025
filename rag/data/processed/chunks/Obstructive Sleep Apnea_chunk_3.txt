crowded oropharynx (a Mallampati score of 3 to 4), retrognathia, micrognathia, tonsillar hypertrophy, low-lying palate, overjet, and a large tongue. However, lateral narrowing is the only independent predictor of OSA after adjusting for body weight and neck size (see **Image.** Clinical Assessment of Sleep Apnea).[34] ## Evaluation Adult patients with unexplained daytime or sleep-related symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep, should be evaluated for sleep apnea. However, universal screening for OSA is not recommended in asymptomatic patients, except for those at risk due to occupational hazards, such as drivers or pilots.[35][36] In addition, due to the high prevalence of OSA and its disease burden, patients with specific comorbidities, including refractory atrial fibrillation, resistant hypertension, and a history of stroke, should also be screened for sleep apnea, regardless of symptoms.[37] Nighttime in-laboratory level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing OSA. During the test, patients are monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography belts around the chest and abdomen to monitor motion, an electrocardiogram (ECG) lead, and electromyogram sensors to detect muscle contractions in the chin, chest, and legs (see **Image.** Polysomnography, 120-Second Window Showing Obstructive Sleep Apnea). Scoring respiratory events in adults relies on 4 primary channels: - Oronasal thermal sensor - Nasal air pressure transducer - Inductance plethysmography (with esophageal manometry or a pressure catheter may be used as alternatives) - Pulse oximetry [38] A snoring monitor is a required channel but does not contribute to the scoring of respiratory events. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), hypopnea is defined by either 1 of 2 criteria: - A reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds, accompanied by at least 4% oxygen desaturation (eg, Medicare criteria). - A reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds, associated with either at least 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal from sleep on EEG (recommended AASM criteria).[39] Scoring apnea requires both of the following criteria to be met: - A drop in the peak signal excursion by more than or equal to 90% of the pre-event baseline flow. - A duration of the flow reduction of more than or equal to 10 seconds. As mentioned below, apneas are usually further classified based on respiratory effort, which is determined by respiratory inductance plethysmography
