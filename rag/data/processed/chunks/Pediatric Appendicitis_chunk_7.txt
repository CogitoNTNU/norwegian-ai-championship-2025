value to diagnostic criteria as outlined: - 2 points each: tenderness in the right lower quadrant and leukocytosis - 1 point each: migratory right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, fever, nausea or vomiting, and anorexia The highest score an individual with suspected acute appendicitis can receive is 9 points. Higher scores are consistent with a higher probability of acute appendicitis. An Alvarado score of 7 points or higher is significantly associated with acute appendicitis.[29] ## Treatment / Management **Medical Management of Acute Appendicitis** Despite significant advancements in managing acute appendicitis with primary antibiotic therapy, the primary treatment option for acute appendicitis continues to be surgical. A large, randomized trial of antibiotic therapy for the primary management of acute appendicitis showed that while antibiotic therapy might have comparable results with appendectomy in the short term, 1 of 4 participants in the antibiotic therapy arm required appendectomy within 1 year.[30] The efficacy of antibiotics as the primary treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis has been extensively researched, yielding mixed and contradictory results and conclusions.[31][32][33] Adverse events, including 30-day postintervention peritonitis, were higher in the antibiotic therapy arm of one trial. However, other trials support the feasibility of antibiotic therapy alone despite the cumulative incidence of appendicitis recurrence for uncomplicated acute appendicitis.[34] Although the Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial offers the option of using antibiotics alone to manage acute appendicitis, it is imperative to exercise caution when considering this approach. Several outcomes of this approach remain uncertain, including the potential for missed malignancies, cases of recurrent appendicitis, and the long-term efficacy of this method.[35] The Prospective Observational Study on Acute Appendicitis Worldwide (POSAW), an international collaborative study, has confirmed that surgical management remains the main effective option for treating appendicitis.[30][36] Despite the availability of alternative therapeutic approaches with primary antibiotic therapy, appendectomy remains the standard practice for treating acute uncomplicated appendicitis.[37] The antibiotic coverage for acute appendicitis typically involves targeting aerobic and anaerobic bacteria pending culture results; a combination of antibiotics is used. A third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor, such as ampicillin-sulbactam, provides coverage against aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Either metronidazole or clindamycin is administered to provide coverage against anaerobic bacteria. This combination of antibiotics is chosen to cover a broad range of potential pathogens that may be involved in appendicitis. However, the choice of antibiotics may vary depending
