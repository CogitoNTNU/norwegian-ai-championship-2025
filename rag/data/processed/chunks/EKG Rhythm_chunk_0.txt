Like all aspects of electrocardiographic interpretation, accurate and rapid rhythm identification is paramount to providing the appropriate treatment to patients. This activity reviews the process of EKG rhythm interpretation and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with cardiac arrhythmias. **Objectives:** - Identify the fundamental concepts of EKG rhythm interpretation. - Evaluate the issues of concern in regard to EKG rhythm interpretation. - Interpret the appropriate evaluation of the clinical significance of EKG rhythm. - Strategize how the interprofessional team can improve care coordination and communication to advance EKG rhythm interpretation and improve outcomes.

An EKG can reveal underlying cardiac problems and uncover electrolyte imbalances that, if left untreated, could lead to morbidity and mortality.[1] The key to successful EKG interpretation is utilizing the same stepwise method with each attempt. A simple approach used by many practitioners is as follows: rate, rhythm, axis, intervals, ST-segment, and T waves. The rhythm on an EKG refers to what is driving the ventricular rate. Like all aspects of electrocardiographic interpretation, accurate and rapid rhythm identification is paramount to treating patients appropriately (see **Image.** EKG Rhythm Flowchart). ## Function One of the unique features of cardiac cells is automaticity. This is the ability to generate an electrical impulse without requiring a stimulus from an external source. Electrical impulses in the heart typically originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the “pacemaker” of the heart. The impulses travel down the internodal pathways via propagation through both the right and left atria (the left using the Bachman bundle) to the atrioventricular (AV) node or junction. The purpose of the AV node is 2-fold: (1) to allow for propagation of the electrical impulses from the atrium to the ventricle and (2) to delay these impulses to the ventricles to allow for the atria to empty. This is commonly referred to as an atrial kick and may account for up to 30% of cardiac
