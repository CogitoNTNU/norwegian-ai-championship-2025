subject to physiological variations. Sex, age, muscle mass, physical activity, and race all interact to affect measured serum activity. Males generally have a larger muscle mass, correlating to higher serum CK activities than females. The racial type also affects CK activities; the mean activity in white individuals is 66% of the activity in black individuals.[34] In white subjects, the reference interval is 46 to 171 U/L for males and 34 to 145 U/L for females when measured with an assay traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) 37 C reference procedure. Newborns generally have higher CK activities resulting from skeletal muscle trauma during birth. Serum CK in infants decreases to the adult reference interval by 6 to 10 weeks. CK-BB may be elevated in neonates, particularly in newborns with brain-damaged or low birth weight.[35] The presence of CK-BB in blood, usually at low concentrations, may represent a physiological finding in the first days of life. The suggested upper reference limits when standardized methods for CK determination are employed are males up to 170 U/L and females up to 145 U/L. With the CK-MB mass assay, the upper reference limit for males is 5.0 μg/L, and the value for females is lower. However, many laboratories use the male reference interval.[36] In populations who frequently exercise, such as well-trained, long-distance runners, the CK-MB content of skeletal muscle increases, which may produce abnormal serum CK-MB concentrations to separate non-myocardial infarction from myocardial infarction patients; a “relative index” (RI) is necessary.[37] The RI relates CK-MB mass concentration in μg/L to measured total CK activity in U/L.[38] Results are expressed as a percentage: physiological: ≤3%, equivocal: 3% to 5%, consistent with myocardial necrosis: >5%.[39] Blood sampling between 8 and 36 hours from symptom onset is necessary to use the RI. ## Clinical Significance CK activity is one of the markers of AMI.[40] The activity rises within 12 hours of AMI symptoms, peaks at 24 to 36 hours, and normalizes after 48 to 72 hours (see **Image.** Creatine Kinase Levels After a Myocardial Infarction). The issue with measuring CK activity for AMI is that it is non-specific to the heart. CK activity can increase in several conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis, chronic muscle diseases, burns, and strenuous exercise.[41] Although the CK-MB measurement is a diagnostic improvement over just CK, the enzyme can still increase in other conditions such as acute muscle injury,
