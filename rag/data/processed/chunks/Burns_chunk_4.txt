carry oxygen and has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Toxicity is considered when carboxyhemoglobin levels exceed 15%. When nitrogenous materials burn, they produce cyanide which interacts with the cytochrome system of mitochondria, inhibiting oxygen utilization. This can block the last step of oxidative phosphorylation, preventing the conversion of pyruvate to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in cells generating ATP from anaerobic metabolism. - Cyanide toxicity is characterized by an anion gap metabolic acidosis in the presence of ample oxygen delivery. If an intraoperative patient experiences persistent hypoxia and acidosis, it may be due to carbon monoxide or cyanide toxicity. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning** Pulse oximetry may not accurately measure oxygenation levels in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. This is because pulse oximetry cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin. To determine the severity of carbon monoxide poisoning, laboratory tests can measure the levels of carboxyhemoglobin present in the blood. In cases where time is crucial, one can consider using a carbon monoxide oximeter. Unfortunately, such devices are not commonly found in modern hospitals. Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen (about 230 to 270 times higher), leading to a shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve towards the left. This results in reduced oxygen delivery to the body's tissues, which can manifest as mental confusion, agitation, nausea, dizziness, and headachesâ€”all indicative of carbon monoxide poisoning. Any patient with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning should immediately receive 100% oxygen. Administration of normobaric 100% oxygen can reduce the half-life of carbon monoxide to 40 to 80 minutes from 240 to 320 minutes, thus expediting recovery. After the carboxyhemoglobin level falls below 10%, stopping administering 100% oxygen is safe. However, monitoring the patient for roughly 24 hours is crucial to ensure they're not experiencing any respiratory issues. Patients with a carboxyhemoglobin level >20% should be considered for intubation and mechanical ventilation to expedite carbon monoxide elimination further and improve tissue oxygenation. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation with accompanying carbon monoxide poisoning should receive 100% FiO2 until carboxyhemoglobin levels normalize to expedite dissociation with hemoglobin. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should also be considered in severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.[1][6][7][8] ## Preparation **Airway Management** When dealing with a burn patient requiring anesthesia in an acute setting, conducting a thorough airway assessment is crucial to detect any indications of airway edema that could lead to a complex airway challenge.
