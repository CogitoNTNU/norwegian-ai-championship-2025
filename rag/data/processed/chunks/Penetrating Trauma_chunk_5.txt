to a temporary threshold shift. If left untreated, this process may progress to apoptosis and necrosis of hair cells and the organ of Corti due to free radical release, ultimately resulting in permanent sensorineural hearing loss.[28][29] AAT induces cochlear inflammation.[30] The pathophysiology of AAT involves the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the inner ear. These substances can directly damage DNA and cell membranes while signaling the upregulation of genes associated with apoptotic cell death. Research indicates that these substances spread from the basal to the apical cochlea over a period of 7 to 10 days. Following AAT, studies on guinea pig cochleas revealed progressive hair cell loss, which correlated with the delayed formation of reactive species, stabilizing after 2 weeks.[31] The inner cochlear hair cells convert sound into nerve signals, while the outer hair cells amplify sound sensitivity. In cases of AAT, the outer hair cells are typically the first to be affected, leading to hearing loss ranging from 40 to 60 dB. Continued damage can further harm the inner hair cells, exacerbating hearing loss. Temporary threshold shifts correspond anatomically to decreased stiffness of the stereocilia in the outer hair cells.[32] The stereocilia become disarrayed and nonfunctional. In instances of severe noise exposure, complete hearing loss may occur if the entire organ of Corti is damaged. Hearing loss is often more pronounced at frequencies higher than 4 kHz.[33] Histopathologically, the primary damage site is the rootlets connecting the stereocilia to the top of the hair cell. Apoptosis of the sensory cells results in progressive Wallerian degeneration and, ultimately, loss of primary auditory nerve fibers. High-intensity noise can damage hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, as well as cause middle ear injuries, including tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular chain dislocation, and oval or round window rupture, which may lead to a perilymphatic fistula.[34] In addition to causing inner ear damage, AAT disrupts middle ear function by interfering with the muscles involved in hearing, specifically the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles. **Stapedius muscle:** This is the smallest skeletal muscle in the human body, measuring approximately 1 mm in length, that protects the cochlea by contracting in response to loud noises, which produces a dampening effect. **Tensor tympani muscle:** This muscle inserts between the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and the neck of the malleus. The tensor tympani muscle shares a tendon with the tensor veli palatini muscle and is innervated
