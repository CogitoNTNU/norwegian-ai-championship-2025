80 years, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease.[5] Early deterioration and death are the major problems with ICH. Coma, at the time of the presentation, indicates a grave prognosis. ASA recommends that the monitoring and management of patients with ICH should be in a dedicated stroke unit. At six months, only 20 percent of patients become independent. The survivors may enter into a persistent vegetative state or locked-in syndrome in case of extensive hemispherical damage or brainstem involvement, respectively. ICH score introduced by Hemphill et al. predicts mortality.[38][39] The points are given as 2 points for Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) 3-4, 1 point for GCS 5-12, 0 points for GCS 13-15, 1 point for>80 years, 0 points for \<80 years, 1 point for infratentorial location, 0 points for supratentorial location, 1 point for ICH volume >30 ml, 0 points for volume \<30 ml. 1 point for intraventricular hemorrhage and 0 points for the absence of intraventricular hemorrhage. The 30-day mortality of each score is as: 0% for score 0, 13% for score 1, 26% for score 2, 72% for score 3, 97% for score 4, and 100% for scores 5 and 6. ## Complications Complications of ICH include cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, seizures, venous thrombotic events, hyperglycemia, increased blood pressure, fever, and infections.[40] Patients with ICH, especially women, have a risk of thromboembolic disease.[20] Almost one-third of patients with ICH develop pulmonary complications such as pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and respiratory distress. About 4% of patients with ICH suffer cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and acute heart failure.[41] Vasospasm, ischemia, rebleeding, seizure, hyponatremia, and hydrocephalus are the complications of SAH. Neurogenic pulmonary edema, an increase in interstitial and alveolar fluid, commonly occurs in subarachnoid hemorrhage.[42] ## Deterrence and Patient Education There is a chance of recurrence of ICH. Hypertension and old age are risk factors. BP should be controlled. Lifestyle modifications should be advised, including avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. Continued multidisciplinary rehabilitation should be done. The following are the possible risk factors for a recurrent ICH: - Lobar location of the initial ICH - Older age - Presence and number of microbleeds on gradient echo MRI - Ongoing anticoagulation - Presence of apolipoprotein E epsilon 2 or epsilon 4 alleles[20] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Patients with hemorrhagic stroke should be managed in a
