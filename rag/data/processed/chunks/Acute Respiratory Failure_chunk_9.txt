locating a pregnancy in patients with a positive pregnancy test - CT of the abdomen and pelvis in nonpregnant adults with suspected appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, or nephrolithiasis or when the ultrasound findings are unrevealing - Colonoscopy for patients with anemia and abdominal pain to evaluate for colon cancer or subacute abdominal pain and diarrhea to assess for inflammatory bowel disease - Scrotal ultrasound for abnormal scrotal examination **Diffuse Abdominal Pain** Diffuse abdominal pain can be more challenging to diagnose and result from pulmonary, cardiac, or intraabdominal pathologies. The initial evaluation for diffuse abdominal pain includes: - CBC with differential - Serum electrolytes - Amylase and lipase - Calculation of the anion gap - Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine - Serum glucose - Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin - Calcium - Pregnancy test in all patients with childbearing potential The remaining evaluation depends on the results of the initial assessment. Some additional considerations are as follows: - Chest radiograph for patients with diffuse upper abdominal pain and suspected pneumonia - Abdominal radiographs to evaluate for pneumoperitoneum and bowel obstruction - CT pulmonary angiogram for patients with diffuse upper abdominal pain and suspected pulmonary embolism - CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis for patients with a suspected volvulus, bowel obstruction, and hemodynamically stable patients with a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm - Abdominal ultrasound for patients with a suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who are hemodynamically unstable - IV-enhanced CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for patients with concern for mesenteric ischemia and aortic dissection The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines that help healthcare professionals determine the best imaging or treatment for a patient. Clinicians can access the criteria at the American College of Radiology's website: <https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Clinical-Tools-and-Reference/Appropriateness-Criteria>. **Children** The evaluation of abdominal pain in children follows a similar approach to adults but requires specific considerations. Clinicians must exclude malrotation, a surgical emergency, in a child younger than 1 who presents with bilious vomiting. Children with abdominal pain and pharyngitis should undergo rapid strep testing. Healthcare professionals infrequently use CT scans of the abdomen in children due to the risks associated with radiation exposure. For children presenting with bilious vomiting, severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, or signs of peritonitis, an abdominal radiograph is usually the initial diagnostic step. This imaging modality swiftly detects perforation through the presence of free air and identifies bowel obstruction
