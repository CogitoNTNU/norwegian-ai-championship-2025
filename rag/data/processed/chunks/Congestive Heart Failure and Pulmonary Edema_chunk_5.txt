disease present and current or previous symptoms of heart failure - D: Heart failure that is refractory and requires specialized interventions [6] **NYHA Functional Classification of Heart Failure** The NYHA classification is a functional classification of heart failure and is based on how much the patients' symptoms limit their physical activity and to what degree physical activity can cause the person to become symptomatic. The grading scale is from I (least severe)to grade IV (the most severe) where the patient cannot perform physical activity and has symptoms at rest.[6] **Diagnostic Tests** Testing for heart failure in patients should be focused on the patient's symptoms, clinical suspicion, and pre-existing or current stage of heart failure. Ordering multiple routine tests should be avoided in all patients with heart failure. Basic tests that should merit consideration for all patients evaluated for heart failure are the following: - Serum electrolytes and kidney function - Complete blood count - Lipid level - Liver function tests - Troponin level if there is concern that myocardial injury is the cause of symptoms - Thyroid-stimulating hormone - An electrocardiogram Other tests that may be considered based on the severity and classification of the patient's condition are: - **Chest x-rays** assess for signs of pulmonary congestion or edema in acute decompensated heart failure (see Image. Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph). - **Biomarkers** are used to assess patients with more complex symptoms than acute heart failure (ie, B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). For further information on the recommendations for evaluating heart failure, please see the American Heart Association and New York Heart Association classification-based heart failure guidelines.[1][2][6] ## Treatment / Management **Treatment of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema** The focus of treatment for patients with heart failure is dependent on the severity of the symptoms and the stage of heart failure. When patients are in acute decompensated heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, the most important focus for therapeutic interventions is the enhancement of hemodynamic status through the reduction of vascular congestion and improving preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility.[2] In flash pulmonary edema, where there is a rapid onset of heart failure, the initial management and treatment goals are very similar to acute decompensated heart failure. Treatment options for acute decompensated heart failure and flash pulmonary edema are as follows: - **ABCs:** As with all patients, it is crucial to assess airway, breathing, and circulation in
