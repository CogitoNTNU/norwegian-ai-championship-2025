It is a serious and life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of bacterial meningitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the risk factors associated with development of bacterial meningitis in children and adults. - Describe common history and physical findings in a patient with bacterial meningitis. - Review the treatment and management options available for bacterial meningitis. - Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of bacterial meningitis, minimize complications, and improve outcomes.

It is a serious and life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Bacterial meningitis is caused by a bacterial infection of the meninges, resulting in inflammation. The infection is either community-acquired or nosocomial. Community-acquired bacterial meningitis is the result of the invasion of the bacteria into the meninges from bacteremia or direct extension from local infection. The most common bacterial culprit varies by age. Group B _Streptococcus_ is common in infants less than 2 months of age while _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is the most common in all other age groups, with the exception of 11 - 17 year old, where _Neisseria meningitidis is_ still the most common cause. _Listeria monocytogenes_ and gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella_ , _Enterobacter_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ are other less common causes. _Hemophilus influenzae_ is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals. Nosocomial infections are caused by _S. pneumonia_ , _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Staphylococcus albus_ , and gram-negative bacilli. As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003â€“2007, _S. pneumoniae_ was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), _N. meningitidis_ (13.9%),
