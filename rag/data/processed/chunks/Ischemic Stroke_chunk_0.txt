As the most common type of stroke, ischemic strokes pose a significant burden on public health systems and individuals alike. With its pervasive impact across diverse patient populations, strokes constitute a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies is crucial in mitigating the impact of this pervasive neurological condition. This course provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of ischemic stroke, offering participants invaluable insights into the nuances of care delivery for this complex condition. From early recognition to evidence-based treatment modalities, participants will explore key strategies to optimize patient outcomes and minimize long-term sequelae. Moreover, the course highlights the pivotal role of an interprofessional team in promptly recognizing and effectively managing ischemic strokes, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts among healthcare professionals from various specialties. **Objectives:** - Apply anatomical anatomy to facilitate the proper treatment of acute ischemic stroke. - Assess acute ischemic stroke using the current NIH stroke scale to measure the severity of ischemic stroke. - Implement the recommended management of acute ischemic stroke, including immediate interventions, mitigation of sequelae, and subacute management. - Collaborate with an interprofessional team to improve care coordination and communication while managing patients affected by acute and subacute ischemic strokes.

Strokes are categorized as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic strokes can further be classified as intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among ischemic strokes, the Trial Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification is used to subdivide the categories that include the following: - Cardioembolism - Small vessel occlusion
