the presence of antimyosin autoantibodies is associated with a worse prognosis.[21][26] According to the 2024 ECDP, key risk factors for adverse outcomes in myocarditis include: - Clinical presentation: Heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or electrical instability, such as recurrent ventricular tachycardia or advanced atrioventricular block. - Echocardiography: Evidence of biventricular dysfunction. - Cardiac MRI: Presence of biventricular dysfunction and LGE. - Endomyocardial biopsy: Histopathological diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis.[5] ## Complications Acute complications of myocarditis include: - Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. - Cardiogenic shock. - Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation: This increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. - Bradyarrhythmias: High-grade atrioventricular block necessitating intervention. - Atrial arrhythmias: Atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. - Thromboembolic events: These events include stroke or systemic embolism due to left ventricular dysfunction. Subacute and chronic or long-term complications include: - Dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure. - Recurrent episodes of myocarditis. - Increased risk of sudden cardiac death. - Myocardial fibrosis and scarring. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Preventing acute myocarditis begins with addressing avoidable causes, particularly infectious triggers such as respiratory and enteroviral illnesses. Patients should be educated on essential hygiene practices—such as regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick, and staying up-to-date with routine vaccinations, including those for influenza and COVID-19—to help reduce the risk of viral myocarditis.[27] Patients should be informed about the variable and often nonspecific nature of myocarditis symptoms. Any febrile or systemic illness followed by new-onset symptoms—such as exertional or positional shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, or syncope—warrants prompt medical evaluation. Strenuous physical activity should be avoided during and immediately after a viral illness, as it may increase the risk of cardiac complications. Notably, the diagnosis of myocarditis is frequently delayed due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the need to rule out other conditions using imaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessment.[5] Once the diagnosis is confirmed, comprehensive patient education is essential to improving outcomes. Patients should be informed about the possible trajectories of the disease, including full recovery, delayed improvement, or progression to chronic heart dysfunction that may require lifelong medication. Education should emphasize the importance of adhering to strict physical activity restrictions during the acute phase, abstaining from alcohol, following prescribed medical treatments, and participating in cardiac rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and restore functional capacity.[27][28] Long-term management may include GDMT for heart failure in patients with persistent cardiac dysfunction.
