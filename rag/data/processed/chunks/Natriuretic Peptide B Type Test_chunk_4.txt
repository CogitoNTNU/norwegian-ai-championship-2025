than tracking the peptide trajectory of an individual patient.[39] All immunoassays for BNP and NT-proBNP are heterogeneous, using a separation step between bound and free antibodies; there are no problems with photometric interferents such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, or lipemia.[40] The cross-reactivity of assays for BNP and NT-proBNP towards proBNP is an important consideration since it is now known that proBNP also circulates in the blood of patients with heart failure.[41] Because proBNP is the precursor protein to both BNP and NT-proBNP, the epitopes used to raise antibodies for these latter two peptides are also present in the proBNP peptide structure.[42] proBNP also exists in the blood of heart failure patients as an O-linked glycoprotein. There are seven potential glycosylation sites from the center of the molecule (from the non-BNP amino acid sequences).[43] There have been studies that have tested the cross-reactivity of proBNP towards commercial BNP and NT-proBNP assays. For BNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 17% to 38% for glycosylated proBNP and 5% to 14% for non-glycosylated proBNP.[44] For NT-proBNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 29% to 249% for non-glycosylated proBNP but with no cross-reactivity towards glycosylated proBNP.[45] The relative composition of blood with regard to the various BNP, NT-proBNP, proBNP, and glycosylated forms present in the blood of patients with heart failure is not known.[46] Therefore, comparing the results of different markers and different assays of the same marker will be difficult.[8] The clinical significance of the presence of HAMA and heterophile antibodies is diminished for BNP and NT-proBNP assays; mild false-positive results do not have significant clinical implications.[47] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings BNP and NT-proBNP levels increase in patients with cardiac disease due to myocardial stress and volume overload.[42] Patients with a BNP elevation of over 100 pg/mL should be assessed further for the signs and symptoms of cardiac disease.[48] Though BNP is traditionally used in the diagnosis of left ventricular systolic function, it can be elevated through other processes as well; for example, right ventricular failure, acute myocardial infarction, congenital heart disease, and valvular disease.[6] Other situations in which natriuretic peptides are elevated include any disease that increases blood volume and thus wall stress, such as sepsis, anemia, renal dysfunction, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy, and cirrhosis.[49] In healthy individuals, BNP levels vary by age and genetic sex; levels increase with age and are higher on average in females than males.[34] Circulating levels
