tailored based on the type of tumor, its grade, stage, and the extent of peritoneal involvement. Treatment strategies may range from nonoperative medical management to a multimodality approach incorporating chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical intervention. Palliative management plays a critical role for patients with advanced disease or those unsuitable for curative treatment. Approaches to palliate bowel obstruction include medications to reduce symptoms, nasogastric or intestinal decompression tubes, stoma formation, tube enterostomy, or the placement of intestinal stents.[36] These measures aim to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and manage complications associated with obstructive neoplastic conditions. ## Prognosis The prognosis of SBO depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, the patient's overall health status, the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment, and whether the obstruction is simple or complicated (eg, involving strangulation or perforation). Early diagnosis and prompt management significantly improve outcomes, while delays in treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. **Simple SBO** Patients with simple SBO, where there is no evidence of ischemia or perforation, generally have a favorable prognosis. Nonoperative management resolves most cases of partial or adhesional obstructions without surgery. Recovery is typically rapid if managed appropriately, with mortality rates in these cases being low (1%â€“5%). However, recurrent SBO remains a challenge, particularly in patients with prior surgeries and adhesions. **Complicated SBO** Complicated SBO, involving bowel strangulation, ischemia, or perforation, carries a significantly worse prognosis due to the risk of sepsis, peritonitis, and multiorgan failure. Mortality rates in these cases range from 10% to 40%, depending on the extent of bowel compromise and the speed of surgical intervention. Strangulated obstructions, which may progress to gangrene or perforation, demand urgent surgical treatment to minimize life-threatening complications. **Prognostic Factors** Several factors influence prognosis: - Etiology - Adhesional SBO generally has a better prognosis than obstruction caused by malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease. Malignant bowel obstruction often indicates advanced disease, with limited curative options and a focus on palliative care. - Age and comorbidities - Elderly patients and those with significant comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have higher risks of complications and mortality. - Timeliness of treatment - Delays in diagnosis or intervention can worsen outcomes due to prolonged ischemia, necrosis, or systemic infection. - Extent of bowel damage - The need for extensive bowel resection may lead to short bowel syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, and long-term morbidity. **Long-Term Outcomes** SBOs, particularly those caused by adhesions, can
