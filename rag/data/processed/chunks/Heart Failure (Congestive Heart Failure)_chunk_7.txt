counteracting the excess sodium and water retention.[31] Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down several hormones, including BNP, ANP, and bradykinin; it targets several novel therapeutics. Neprilysin is always used with an angiotensin receptor blocker because it increases angiotensin II levels, and when administered with an ACE inhibitor, it causes significant angioedema.[32][33] Causes of CHF are split about equally between HFrEF and HFpEF but require different treatment plans. In HFpEF, myocardial relaxation decreases, and the stiffness of the ventricle increases due to an increase in ventricular afterload. This perpetuates a similar maladaptive hemodynamic compensation and leads to progressive HF. Patients with HFpEF tend to be older, female, and hypertensive. Atrial fibrillation and anemia are also more likely comorbid conditions. Some evidence has demonstrated that the prognosis is worse than those with HFrEF. However, appropriate targets may not have been identified for optimal therapeutic interventions.[34][35] ## History and Physical **Clinical History** The diagnosis and classification of HF are primarily based on the presence and severity of symptoms and physical exam findings. A detailed history of symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and functional capacity is imperative to treat the patient adequately. Acute CHF presents primarily with signs of congestion and may also present with organ hypoperfusion or cardiogenic shock.[36] The most commonly reported symptom is shortness of breath. This must be classified as exertional, positional (orthopnea), and acute or chronic. Other commonly reported symptoms of CHF include chest pain, anorexia, and exertional fatigue. Anorexia is due to hepatic congestion, bowel edema, and reduced blood flow to splanchnic circulation. Some patients may present with a recumbent cough due to orthopnea. Patients may also experience abdominal discomfort due to hepatic congestion or ascites. Patients with arrhythmias can present with palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Another symptom that increases morbidity is edema, especially of the lower extremities. This can limit mobility and balance; total body water and weight increases of >20 lbs are not uncommon. While patients with acute HF present with overt respiratory distress, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, patients with chronic heart failure tend to curtail their physical activity; hence, symptoms may be obscured. Identifying triggers of acute decompensation, including recent infection, noncompliance with cardiac medications, use of NSAIDs, or increased salt intake, is essential. **Physical Examination Findings** The findings on physical examination vary with the stage and acuity of the disease. Patients may have isolated symptoms of left-sided HF, right-sided HF, or a combination
