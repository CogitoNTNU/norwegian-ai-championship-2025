high risk of intrathoracic injury. Important history components include chest pain, dyspnea, mechanism of injury (fall, direction, and speed), drug/alcohol use, comorbidities, surgical history, and anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapies. The mechanisms of action that were predictive of significant thoracic injury are motor vehicle accident greater than 35 mph, fall from more than 15 feet, pedestrian ejection of more than 10 feet, and trauma with depressed level of consciousness.[14] Clinical findings of hemothorax are broad and may overlap with pneumothorax; these include respiratory distress, tachypnea, decreased or absent breath sounds, dullness to percussion, chest wall asymmetry, tracheal deviation, hypoxia, narrow pulse pressure, and hypotension. Inspect the chest wall for signs of contusion, abrasions, "seat belt sign," penetrating injury, paradoxical movement ("flail chest”), ecchymosis, deformities, crepitus, and point tenderness. Distended neck veins are concerning for pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade but might be absent in the setting of hypovolemia. Increased respiratory rate, effort, and use of accessory muscles may be signs of impending respiratory failure. The following physical findings should prompt the clinician to consider these conditions: - Distended neck veins → pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax, cardiogenic failure, air embolism - "Seat belt sign" → deceleration or vascular injury; chest wall contusion/abrasion - Paradoxical chest wall movement → flail chest - Facial/neck swelling or cyanosis → superior mediastinum injury with occlusion or compression of superior vena cava (SVC) - Subcutaneous emphysema → torn bronchus or lung parenchyma laceration - Scaphoid abdomen → diaphragmatic injury with herniation of abdominal content into the chest - Excessive abdominal movement with breathing → chest wall injury ## Evaluation Rapid evaluation, recognition, and intervention of potential chest injuries are essential. The American College of Surgeons established the American Traumatic Life Support (ATLS) protocol which implements a standardized and methodical approach of evaluation for every trauma patient.[17] In the setting of traumatic chest injuries, cardiopulmonary assessment should take priority since they have the highest mortality index if missed.[18] Injuries to other thoracic structures must merit consideration; ribs, clavicle, trachea, bronchi, esophagus, and vessels. **Diagnostics: The dawn of POCUS** Imaging plays a very critical role in the management of traumatic injuries. First described by Rozycki et al., the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam evaluates the pericardium, perihepatic, perisplenic, and pelvis for pathologic fluid or air collection.[19] It has shown to provide rapid and accurate evaluation of the traumatic patient with growing evidence to supporting its use to diagnose hemothorax,
