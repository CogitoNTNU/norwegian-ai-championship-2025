for stroke with unknown time of onset:** Most of these patients wake up with an acute stroke. The patients will be ineligible for IV thrombolytic therapy because their last known normal will be at bedtime. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial used the mismatch between a positive DWI MRI sequence showing an acute ischemic infarction and a negative FLAIR MRI sequence indicating that the infarct occurs within 4.5 hours of the MRI. DWI is positive within 30 minutes of an acute infarct. FLAIR sequence will not be positive until about 4.5 hours after an acute infarct. The mismatch indicates that the stroke occurred within 4.5 hours, and therefore, IV thrombolytic will be indicated. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial confirmed the positive result.[36][41] - **IV tenecteplase (within 4.5 hours of stroke onset):** Another fibrinolytic agent, tenecteplase (TNK), may be considered an alternative to alteplase. TNK has advantages over TPA with its longer half-life and can be administered as a single Intravascular (IV) dose. TNK can be given at a dose of 30 to 50 mg IV bolus over 5 sec once (based on weight). TNK has become the fibrinolytic agent of choice for many stroke centers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that TNK appeared to have efficacy and safety profiles similar to TPA.[42][43] The 2023 AHA guidelines state that choosing TNK over TPA in patients without contraindications for IV fibrinolytic who are also eligible to undergo mechanical thrombectomy may be reasonable.[34] A dose of 0.4 mg/kg, compared to 0.25 mg/kg, showed no advantage. - **Mechanical thrombectomy (within 6 hours of stroke onset):** Mechanical thrombectomy should be considered in all patients, even those who received fibrinolytic therapy. The AHA/ASA guidelines do not recommend observation for a response after IV TPA in patients considered for mechanical thrombectomy.[40] In recent years, significant advancements have been made in acute stroke care. Multiple stroke trials in 2015 showed that endovascular thrombectomy in the first 6 hours is much better than standard medical care in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. These benefits are sustained irrespective of geographical location and patient characteristics.[44] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Acute Stroke](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17174)," for more information. - **Mechanical thrombectomy with perfusion study (within 16 to 24 hours of stroke onset):** Perfusion imaging studies (CT perfusion or MR perfusion) can define the areas of the brain that are ischemic but not infarcted, the
