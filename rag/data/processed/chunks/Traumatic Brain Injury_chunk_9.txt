mm Hg and MAP >90 mm Hg - Platelet count >75.000/mm3, PT/aPTT \<1.5 - Aim for normothermia, Hemoglobin level >7 g/dL, SpO2 >94%, PaCO2 of 35 to 38 mm Hg, serum Na 140 to 145 mEq/L - Increased sedation, osmotherapy, and short-term hyperventilation are justified for patients with brain herniation awaiting emergent neurosurgery [48] Proposed tiers in the management of refractory intracranial hypertension include: 1. Evacuation of hematoma harbingering or causing cerebral herniation 1. Physiological neuroprotection 1. Sedation, analgesics, and ventilation 1. CSF drainage 1. Osmotherapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline 1. Hyperventilation 1. Hypothermia 1. Barbiturate coma 1. Decompressive hemicraniectomy [27] ## Differential Diagnosis **Primary Brain Injuries** - Concussion - Contusion - Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) - Epidural Hematoma - Subdural Hematoma - Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage **Secondary Brain Injuries** - Cerebral Edema - Ischemia/Stroke - Infection (eg, meningitis, ventriculitis) - Hypoxic-Anoxic Injury **Other Injuries and Conditions** - Skull Fractures - Cervical Spine Injuries - Post-Concussion Syndrome - Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) - Second Impact Syndrome - Psychiatric Conditions (eg, PTSD, adjustment disorders) ## Prognosis The outcomes after head trauma depend on a multitude of factors. These include the patient's age, the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, the presence of anisocoria, the time to onset of herniation symptoms, the presence of associated polytrauma, concurrent conditions such as hypoxia or hypotension, the type of lesion (whether extradural or subdural hemorrhage), and the Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores.[27] Notably, the post-resuscitation GCS score is a critical determinant of outcome, with patients presenting a GCS of less than eight having a significantly higher mortality risk. CT imaging of the brain is the gold standard in assessing and risk-stratifying those with TBI. There are two well-known scoring systems, Marshall and Rotterdam, that utilize imaging findings to help predict complications, mortality, and the need for neurosurgical intervention. The Marshall score was the first in 1991, followed by the Rotterdam score system in 2005. [49][50] The Rotterdam score uses the presence of epidural lesions, intraventricular blood, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for scoring and outperforms the Marshall score utilizing the following components: intraventricular blood or subarachnoid hemorrhage is graded as 0 (absent) or 1 (present), the basal cistern is graded as 0 (normal), 1 (compressed), or 2 (absent), the epidural mass lesion is graded as 0 (absent) or 1 (present), and the midline shift is graded as 0 (no shift or shift < 5mm)
