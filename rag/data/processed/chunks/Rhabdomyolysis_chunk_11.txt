events associated with mannitol use are volume overload and hyperosmolality. The current literature does not support concomitantly using mannitol and bicarbonate to prevent pigment-induced acute kidney injury.[59][60] Every attempt should be made to prevent the development or worsening of hyperkalemia. Potassium-containing IV fluids like Ringer's lactate should be avoided. A combination of oral sodium polystyrene sulfate and sorbitol is commonly given to patients with crush injuries and hyperkalemia. The role of new potassium-binding agents is unclear because of a lack of studies. Appropriate use of point-of-care devices and electrocardiography should be utilized in patients with suspected hyperkalemia.[61] Patients with crush syndrome should have a Foley catheter placed; IV fluids should be given to maintain urine output at 200 to 300 mL/h. Adequate IV fluid resuscitation should be continued until myoglobinuria is wholly resolved and CPK levels are down-trending. Foley catheters should be used for the shortest time possible to minimize complications like infection. Consideration should be given to loop diuretics in patients with volume overload states. Appropriate use of hemodialysis can be used with anuric AKI, hyperkalemia, and volume overload after conservative measures fail. Peritoneal dialysis is not preferred in the setting of trauma. **Management of Nontraumatic Rhabdomyolysis** Rhabdomyolysis from nontraumatic causes is managed similarly to that secondary to trauma. Adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation with normal isotonic saline should be provided depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis. Management includes removing the offending agent at diagnosis, titration of IV fluids to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 mL/h, and serial daily monitoring of serum CPK levels to document trends. In patients with serum CPK levels less than 5000 U/L, aggressive fluid resuscitation is discouraged as these patients are less likely to develop AKI.[62] Forceful alkaline diuresis can be considered in severe cases where the CPK is more than 30,000 U/L without oliguria, anuria, or AKI. Mannitol is not commonly used in nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Loop diuretics can be considered in the setting of volume overload from aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patients who remain oliguric or anuric, even with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and develop AKI should be considered for hemodialysis. The role of dialysis in the removal of myoglobin has not been demonstrated.[41] **Management of Electrolytes Abnormalities in Rhabdomyolysis** Rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels less than 6 mEq/L without ECG changes should be managed with potassium binders and the use of bicarbonate
