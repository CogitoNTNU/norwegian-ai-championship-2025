require reintervention within 5 years due to recurrent dissection, aneurysm repair, or complications arising from the initial surgical or endovascular procedure. Regular follow-up with imaging and diligent management of modifiable risk factors is crucial to mitigating these risks and improving long-term outcomes. **Long-Term Complications and Recurrence Risk** Despite successful initial treatment, patients with aortic dissection remain at risk for long-term complications. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of redissection or aneurysm formation, either at the site of the initial dissection or in other segments of the aorta. This risk is particularly elevated in patients with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, or those with residual dissection in the descending aorta, which can predispose them to subsequent aortic pathology. Chronic aortic enlargement is another significant issue, particularly in patients with a persistent false lumen. Over time, the false lumen can lead to progressive aortic enlargement, ultimately resulting in aneurysmal dilation and, in severe cases, rupture or the need for additional surgical or endovascular interventions. Close monitoring with serial imaging is essential to detect these changes early and plan for timely intervention if needed. Patients who have experienced aortic dissection are also at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. This risk is especially prominent if the initial dissection involves the coronary arteries or the aortic valve, which can compromise cardiac function over time. Managing cardiovascular risk factors aggressively and maintaining regular follow-up are crucial for these patients. Reintervention rates are relatively high in this population, with up to 20% to 30% of patients requiring additional procedures within 5 years of the initial event. Reinterventions may be necessary due to recurrent dissection, aneurysm repair, or complications stemming from the initial surgical or endovascular approach. Long-term care and diligent follow-up are essential components of managing these patients to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of severe complications. **Prognosis and Quality of Life** Results from several studies indicate that outcomes are significantly improved when managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, which may include a cardiologist, intensivist, pulmonologist, nephrologist, cardiac surgeon, interventional radiologist, and anesthesiologist. Each member of this team plays a critical role in addressing the complex, multisystem nature of aortic dissection. Pharmacists are also integral in patient education, particularly regarding the importance of blood pressure control and medication adherence, which are crucial in preventing complications and disease progression. Notably, outcomes are
