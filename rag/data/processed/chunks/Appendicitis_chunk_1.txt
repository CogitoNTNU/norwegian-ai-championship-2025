distinctive nature of appendicitis is vital in providing timely care and preventing complications associated with this common condition. ## Etiology Appendicitis is primarily caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen leading to inflammation. The obstruction can be due to various factors such as appendicoliths, appendiceal tumors, intestinal parasites, or hypertrophied lymphatic tissues. These mechanical obstructions result in the development of acute appendicitis. It is important to note that the underlying causes of luminal obstructions may vary among different age groups, highlighting the need for age-specific considerations when evaluating and managing appendicitis. The appendix is known to naturally host aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including _Escherichia coli_ and _Bacteroides spp_. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by any mechanism can cause an overgrowth of bacteria leading to acute inflammation and abscess formation. Recent studies utilizing next-generation sequencing techniques have revealed that patients with complicated perforated appendicitis exhibit a significantly higher bacterial phyla load than those with uncomplicated appendicitis. This finding suggests that the severity and complications of appendicitis may be associated with an increased abundance of bacterial species.[7] In the pediatric population, acute appendicitis is most commonly caused by lymphoid hyperplasia. This condition involves an overgrowth of lymphoid tissue in the appendix, leading to inflammation and localized ischemia. This inflammatory process increases the risk of appendiceal perforation, the formation of contained periappendiceal abscess, and subsequent peritonitis. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is frequently misdiagnosed as one of the etiologies of appendicitis.[8] In adults, acute appendicitis is commonly attributed to various causes, including infections, fecaliths, or tumors. Tumors associated with acute appendicitis in adults include appendiceal adenocarcinoma, mucocele, and carcinoid tumor.[9] ## Epidemiology Acute appendicitis commonly represents a significant proportion of acute abdominal conditions. It has an incidence rate ranging from 100 to 223 new cases per 100,000 individuals per year.[10][11] In the United States alone, approximately 300,000 hospital visits are reported annually related to appendicitis.[12] While acute appendicitis can occur at any age, it is most commonly observed in the age range of 5 to 45. This age distribution reflects the higher incidence of appendicitis during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. The mean age at presentation is 28. Overall, there is a slight preponderance of acute appendicitis in males compared to females. The lifetime incidence of acute appendicitis is 8.6% in males and 6.7% in females.[13] However, it is important to note that appendicitis can occur in both sexes, and the difference in incidence between
