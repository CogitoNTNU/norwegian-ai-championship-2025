groups, especially in pediatric cases.[4] Ideally, obtaining CSF fluid should precede antibiotic administration. However, initiating antibiotic therapy promptly is essential if this would cause a delay in treatment or if the patient is critically ill. Additionally, it is crucial to place the patient on droplet isolation precautions until the cause of the infection is identified. If HSV or (VZV) is suspected, intravenous acyclovir should be included in the empiric treatment regimen.[4] If the CSF fluid results are more consistent with aseptic meningitis, discontinuing antibiotics should be considered, considering the patient's initial presentation and clinical status. Management of viral meningitis (excluding HSV and VZV) primarily involves supportive care.[4] Specific treatments for various bacteria, fungi, and others are beyond the scope of this activity. However, as discussed earlier, these treatments should be tailored based on individual clinical presentation and underlying health conditions. Steroids are employed as adjunctive therapy to mitigate the inflammatory response. Dexamethasone, administered 10 to 20 minutes before or concurrently with antibiotics, is supported by evidence, even in cases where the etiology is initially unknown while awaiting culture results.[4] Research has demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing short-term neurologic sequelae and hearing loss, although this benefit is more pronounced in cases of bacterial meningitis.[18] A repeat LP is generally unnecessary but should be considered for patients whose clinical condition does not improve after 48 hours. Continued monitoring and reevaluation of the patient's neurological status are essential in determining the appropriate course of action, ensuring comprehensive and responsive care. After confirming the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis and ensuring the patient's clinical stability, discharge home is usually appropriate except for cases involving older patients, immunocompromised individuals, and children with pleocytosis. Home care instructions should be tailored to specific etiology when discharging the patient. For instance, patients diagnosed with enterovirus should be instructed to maintain excellent hand hygiene and avoid sharing food, as the virus is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route.[2][4] Supportive treatment is essential for all patients, involving pain management and fever control using antipyretics such as acetaminophen, paracetamol, and ibuprofen. In cases of drug-induced meningitis, discontinuing the causative drug is crucial. If necessary, the medication should be replaced with an alternative that does not provoke meningeal irritation.[2][4] ## Differential Diagnosis The signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis are frequently vague and nonspecific, leading to a broad range of possible diagnoses. Headache and fever, among the most common symptoms, significantly shape the
