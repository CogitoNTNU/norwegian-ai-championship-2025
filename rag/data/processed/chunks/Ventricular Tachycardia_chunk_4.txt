is interrupted on the ventricular side (for example, due to a change in ventricular conduction), the tachycardia may cease with a ventricular event. Alternatively, if the circuit is interrupted at the atrial level, termination may occur with an atrial event. The key distinction is that these forms of SVT are not solely dependent on atrial activity, allowing for termination through either atrial or ventricular event. - The term "wobble" in the context of tachycardia refers to spontaneous variations in the tachycardia cycle length (TCL). These fluctuations often result from variations in conduction velocity along different pathways that participate in the tachycardia circuit. In AVNRT, a wobble in the R-R interval suggests the presence of a "slow pathway" within the AV node. This finding also helps exclude atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia typically causes variations in the A-A interval rather than the R-R interval.[9] **Pacing Maneuvers During SVT** Ventricular overdrive pacing (VOP) is a crucial technique for differentiating various types of SVT. To ensure accurate interpretation, specific conditions must be met during the maneuver, including: - Ventricular pacing is performed at a rate 10 to 30 milliseconds faster than the TCL, and it must be confirmed that the atrial rate advances to match the ventricular pacing rate. - The same tachycardia should continue after pacing stops. - No significant fluctuations, or “wobbles,” in the TCL should be present during pacing. When these criteria are fulfilled, the maneuver’s results can be interpreted based on 2 key features, described below: - **Cessation response** - After the conclusion of ventricular overdrive pacing (VOP), the final atrial beat that has been advanced to the pacing cycle length is identified and represents the initial “A” in the cessation response. The pattern of this response helps distinguish the type of supraventricular tachycardia, as mentioned below. - In AVNRT and AVRT, an A-(H)-V response is observed. - In atrial tachycardia (AT), an A-A-(H)-V response is observed. - This response reflects the underlying mechanism of tachycardia. In both AVNRT and AVRT, atrial activation during ventricular pacing occurs via the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit, leaving the anterograde limb available for conduction. As a result, the last retrograde atrial beat (A) from the final ventricular (V) pacing stimulus triggers the subsequent His bundle (H) and ventricular (V) activation, producing the characteristic A–H–V response. - On the other hand, during atrial tachycardia, ventricular pacing renders the AV conduction pathway immediately
