therapy after hospital discharge for heart failure.[75] Bumetanide and torsemide have better bioavailability than furosemide. Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Diuretic resistance is a common problem and may be due to excessive dietary sodium consumption, using medications that negatively affect diuretic action, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or underlying chronic kidney disease. A meta-analysis of 11 trials of 14,262 patients in sinus rhythm, including 244 patients with HFpEF, demonstrated that beta blockers reduce mortality and have beneficial effects.[76] Patients with HFpEF and concomitant coronary artery disease also benefit from beta-blocker administration. The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial of 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and an LVEF of greater than 45% that demonstrated some reduction in hospitalization rates for heart failure.[77] This was particularly true for patients with an LVEF of less than 55% to 60% and those with elevated BNP.[78] A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan, as compared with valsartan, has a tendency to lower the risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations overall, but more so in women with HFpEF than men; the average LVEF in study participants was 57%.[79] **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy** The effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy on cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF has been demonstrated in the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) and Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-PRESERVED) trials.[80] The DELIVER trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin decreased the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with HFpEF.[81] The EMPEROR-PRESERVED trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalizations, decline in kidney function, and improved quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[82] The effects of SGLTi therapy are consistent for patients with HFpEF across all age groups, and increasing age has not been associated with an increase in adverse events.[16][83] SGLT2i therapy should be considered in all patients with HFpEF, with or without underlying type 2 diabetes, as early as index hospitalization after initial medical stabilization.[81] In patients with HFpEF, obesity, and underlying type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonists are beneficial if dual therapy is
