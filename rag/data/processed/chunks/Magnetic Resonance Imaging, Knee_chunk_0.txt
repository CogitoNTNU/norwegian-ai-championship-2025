When used correctly, MRI imaging is noninvasive and, in some cases, eliminates the need for surgical intervention or invasive procedures. This activity outlines the appropriate clinical use of MRI to evaluate for common clinical questions (and is not all-encompassing). It reviews contraindications that are important considerations for the interprofessional team contemplating this imaging modality. **Objectives:** - Assess the appropriate use of MRI imaging broadly organized by anatomy. - Evaluate the appropriate use of gadolinium-based contrast and risk factors for developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. - Identify contraindications to MRI, specifically related to implanted hardware. - **Coordinate** with interprofessional team members to reduce unnecessary imaging and improve diagnostic efficiency.

Since then, MR's scope and application have broadened significantly and now encompasses abdominopelvic and cardiac imaging. Clinicians frequently order MRIs to characterize soft tissue and osseous lesions or masses. In some cases, the varying MRI sequences can determine the composition of these abnormalities. For example, MRI elastography can diagnose and surveil hepatic fibrosis, sparing the patient from an invasive and repetitive biopsy. MR angiography, using both contrast-enhanced and non-contrast techniques, can diagnose vascular occlusive disease and stenosis. Faster scan times and gating techniques minimizing cardiac and respiratory motion make MRI a useful non-invasive tool for cardiac evaluations of structure, function, and myocardial perfusion.[2][3] A major advantage of MRI is the ability to produce high-quality images with superior soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. The magnet generates images based on the tissues' specific and unique magnetic properties driven by the spin properties of hydrogen molecules.[4] This makes MRI especially useful to evaluate
