undergoing operative intervention. **Percutaneous Cholecystostomy Tube and Stent Placement** In those patients who are too unstable to undergo surgery, clinicians should consider interventional radiology consultation for percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.[21] Percutaneous drainage is often the definitive treatment because acute acalculous cholecystitis has a lower recurrence rate when compared to acute calculous cholecystitis. The cholecystostomy tube can be removed after 3 weeks.[22] After percutaneous drainage and recovery, outpatient tube studies by interventional radiology can confirm patency of the cystic duct before removal. Alternatively, the patient can undergo cholecystectomy between 4 and 8 weeks after tube placement.[23] Another treatment option is cystic duct stent placement via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to decompress the gallbladder and prevent cystic duct obstruction.[24] However, this approach is not as widely available as percutaneous cholecystostomy, and outcomes have not been studied as extensively. **Surgical Management** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred definitive approach. However, an open cholecystectomy can also be performed if a contraindication to a minimally invasive approach is identified. Acute acalculous cholecystitis must be addressed fairly urgently because rapid progression and deterioration may result if left untreated. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is treated similarly to chronic calculous cholecystitis with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A robotic approach should be considered depending on the surgeon's experience. Studies suggest that a robotic approach may be associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower conversion rate to an open approach when compared with a laparoscopic approach.[25] ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses that should also be considered when evaluating acalculous cholecystitis include: - Biliary colic - Calculous cholecystitis - Choledocholithiasis - Cholangitis - Pancreatitis - Hepatitis - Gastritis - Peptic Ulcer Disease - Appenditis - Mesenteric ischemia ## Prognosis Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a serious illness that has high morbidity and mortality, which is in part due to the critically ill patient population. The reported mortality rate of acute acalculous cholecystitis varies from 30% to 75%.[26][27] Patients who recover also have a long recovery. ## Complications The following complications are associated with acalculous cholecystitis: - Perforation of the gallbladder - Gangrene of the gallbladder - Sepsis ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Most patients can be discharged home the same day or the day after cholecystectomy. Depending on whether the gallbladder was gangrenous or perforated, antibiotics may be warranted postoperatively. Over-the-counter analgesics usually provide adequate pain control, but a short course of narcotics can be considered. Complaints of shoulder pain following laparoscopic surgery, which
