is related to respiration rather than the cardiac cycle.[30] Asking the patient to hold their breath while auscultating can help differentiate between the 2 rubs. Even in the absence of a pericardial friction rub, the diagnosis of acute pericarditis should still be considered if clinical suspicion is strong, as its absence does not rule out the diagnosis. More than half of patients with acute pericarditis exhibit characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes that evolve through 4 stages over several weeks, showing significant temporal variability, as mentioned below (see **Image.** Electrocardiographic Findings in Acute Pericarditis).[31] - Stage I typically presents with diffuse, concave ST-segment elevation, accompanied by reciprocal ST depression in the lead AVR. This stage may also feature PR segment elevation in lead AVR (and possibly V1), which can effectively differentiate acute pericarditis from myocardial infarction.[32] Although localized pericarditis can present with ST elevations in specific leads, diffuse changes on the ECG are more commonly observed. - Stage II typically occurs within the first week and shows normalization of ST and PR segment changes. - Stage III is characterized by widespread T-wave inversions. - Stage IV involves the eventual normalization of T waves. The initial ST elevation in pericarditis should not be confused with an acute injury pattern, where ST elevation appears in a localized distribution and is concave down, unlike the concave-up pattern seen in pericarditis. Acute injury patterns are also typically associated with reciprocal ST depressions in multiple leads (not limited to AVR, as in pericarditis), and Q waves often emerge in the same distribution—or develop shortly thereafter—as part of the natural progression of acute or subacute myocardial infarction. The differential diagnosis for ST elevations should include early repolarization abnormalities commonly observed in healthy individuals. These abnormalities are characterized by an elevated J-point, often presenting as an initial slur at the beginning of the ST segment. While they may appear in several leads, they are typically not diffuse.[33] Clinically, acute pericarditis is indicated by a characteristic description of chest pain and the presence of a pericardial friction rub upon auscultation. However, laboratory studies, ECG, and echocardiography are often necessary to confirm the diagnosis. According to the 2015 ESC guidelines, a diagnosis of acute pericarditis requires the presence of at least 2 out of 4 criteria, as mentioned below. - Pericardial chest pain - Pericardial rubs - New widespread ST elevation or PR depression on ECG - New or worsening pericardial
