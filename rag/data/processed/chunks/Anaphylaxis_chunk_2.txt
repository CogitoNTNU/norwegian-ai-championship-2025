severe the disease process. Morbidity and mortality are most often related to loss of airway and distributive shock. Early recognition and aggressive treatment greatly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The first hour is not the only time of concern, however, as anaphylactic reactions can also occur biphasically in up to 20% of cases. Even after successful management of the initial presenting symptoms, there can be a recurrence of symptoms peaking 8 to 11 hours after the initial reaction. While the biphasic response is only clinically significant in 4 to 5% of patients with diagnosed anaphylaxis, the potentially fatal second reaction should not be dismissed after treatment of the initial reaction. While most of the focus is on the above symptoms of respiratory, cutaneous, and hypotension, it is important to understand and evaluate for any other signs of end-organ damage from hypo-perfusion. This may include abdominal pain and cramps, vomiting, hypotonia, syncope, or incontinence. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms occur in 25 to 30% of patients. While the loss of airway control due to laryngeal edema is the primary concern, one must not fail to recognize anaphylaxis in a patient who does not endorse upper airway edema or respiratory complaints. ## Evaluation Diagnosing anaphylaxis is clinical; thus, laboratory studies or other diagnostics are unnecessary. Most anaphylactic deaths occur within the first hour after antigen exposure. Rapid recognition and action are imperative.[2][12][13] Consideration for anaphylaxis is appropriate in the presence of 2 or more involved systems, even in the absence of airway involvement or hypotension (see above). A consensus criterion has been constructed to improve clinical recognition to prevent delayed treatment, as this poses a great risk to patients. See **Image.** Anaphylaxis. **Clinical Criteria for Anaphylaxis (1 of the following with onset within minutes to hours)**\* _Unknown exposure to an antigen yet rapidly developing urticaria or other skin/mucosal layer symptoms associa_ _ted with any 1 of the following:_ 1. Respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia, inability to maintain patency; persistent cough or throat clearing can be heralding symptoms) 1. Hypotension (systolic less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease of greater than 30% from baseline) 1. Signs or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction, for example, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence _Likely exposure to an antigen and symptoms involving any 2 of the following body systems:_ 1. Integumentary symptoms: Skin or mucosal layer (rash, pruritus, erythema, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or uvula). See **Image.**
