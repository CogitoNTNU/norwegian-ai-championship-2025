Ringer’s lactate contains sodium and potassium, it may be warranted to check these levels frequently in some cases. The sodium concentration in Ringer’s lactate is less than the physiologic range in plasma, and large amounts of administration can drive sodium levels to hyponatremic ranges. With a concentration of 130 mEq/L, administration of this fluid brings the plasma sodium concentration closer to 130 mEq and, depending on the clinical situation, and hyponatremia should be avoided.[10][11] Monitoring of the site of infusion and IV access is necessary to make sure that the fluid is, in fact, being delivered into the vein. IV sites should be monitored for any signs of infiltration, redness, pain, swelling, or discomfort. If present, the infusion should be stopped, and other IV access should be established. Infusion-site monitoring holds across all IV access sites with any drug administration, not just to Ringer’s lactate. ## Toxicity The toxicity of Ringer’s lactate is more associated with volume overload due to IV fluid administration rather than the contents of Ringer’s lactate itself. As previously stated, excessive IV fluid administration can cause fluid overload. Patients may present anywhere on the spectrum from mild peripheral edema to respiratory distress secondary pulmonary edema. Symptomatic patients should be given diuretic therapy and have serum electrolytes monitored closely. In the most severe cases of respiratory distress, patients may require noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or even intubation. Asymptomatic fluid overload can be managed conservatively with fluid restriction and continued monitoring. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes All interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with Ringer's lactate and its indications. Ringer’s lactate is a versatile IV-fluid choice for resuscitation. Ringer’s lactate is superior to normal saline in many ways; however, at times avoided by clinicians due to the stigma of containing lactate. Again, the lactate in Ringer’s lactate is only a problem in patients who have liver dysfunction. In many clinical scenarios, lactate is a beneficial molecule, given its metabolism. Ringer’s lactate is surprisingly cost-effective, better understood, and much more studied than the newer buffered solution and has a role in many illnesses as a strong choice for physiologic fluid replacement. The solution is safe; the only drawback results not from electrolyte changes but the fluid overload that may occur. Hence attention should be paid to the amount of volume infused. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28607&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28607) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28607/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28607)
