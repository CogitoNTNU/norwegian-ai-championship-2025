Prompt recognition of this condition is essential, as in the United States, approximately 1% to 2% of pregnancies are affected, and an estimated 2.7% of pregnancy-related deaths are caused by ectopic pregnancy rupture. Risk factors include pelvic inflammatory disease, smoking, prior ectopic pregnancy, fallopian tube surgery, and infertility. Symptoms typically include lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, particularly if intrauterine pregnancy has not been confirmed. This course explores the complexities surrounding ectopic pregnancy, including the current diagnostic challenges, differential diagnoses, preservation of fertility, provision of psychological support, and varying management approaches. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in promptly recognizing ectopic pregnancies, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional management approach to improve patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Differentiate ectopic pregnancy from conditions with similar clinical features. - Interpret diagnostic studies accurately in the evaluation of ectopic pregnancy. - Implement the most appropriate management approach for each type of ectopic pregnancy. - Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes for patients with an ectopic pregnancy.

Ectopic pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening condition and accounts for 2.7% of pregnancy-related deaths.[1] Most ectopic pregnancies (approximately 97%) occur within the fallopian tube, commonly linked to underlying fallopian tube abnormalities.[2][3] Such abnormalities may result from prior infections (eg, gonorrhea or chlamydia), tubal surgeries (including sterilization), prior ectopic pregnancies, or exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Additional risk factors include conception while using intrauterine devices (IUDs) or progesterone-only contraceptives.[1][4] Although rare, ectopic pregnancies can also occur outside the fallopian tube, such as in the cervix, ovary, abdomen, uterine cornua, or cesarean scars.[5] These extratubal ectopic pregnancies are less likely to be associated with the typical risk factors or tubal pathology, making their diagnosis and management particularly
