This condition can be classified into acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent forms, with recurrence occurring in about 30% of cases. Pericarditis may also present alongside other pericardial syndromes, including pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and effusive-constrictive pericarditis. Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac can lead to significant complications, such as cardiac tamponade, where increased pressure limits the heart's diastolic filling, resulting in obstructive shockâ€”a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention. The condition may evolve into constrictive pericarditis or effusive-constrictive pericarditis over time, complicating the clinical picture. Patients with pericarditis often present with chest pain that can be confused with other conditions, such as myocardial infarction or pleurisy. Diagnostic evaluation typically includes an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray, with additional laboratory tests to identify underlying causes. Understanding the nuances of pericarditis is crucial for effective diagnosis and management, especially given its potential for serious complications. Management of pericarditis includes measuring erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and troponins, along with performing tests such as complete blood count and metabolic panels to identify underlying causes. Treatment typically includes high-dose anti-inflammatory agents, colchicine, and continued nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy until symptoms resolve. This activity outlines the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of pericarditis, emphasizing the role of an interprofessional healthcare team in delivering optimal care. This activity provides healthcare professionals with practical knowledge of evidence-based management strategies and fosters collaborative approaches to enhance patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify the common presenting symptoms of pericarditis and its potential complications, including cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis. - Implement evidence-based treatment protocols for pericarditis, including the administration of anti-inflammatory agents, colchicine, and corticosteroids when indicated. - Select appropriate diagnostic tools, such as electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and laboratory tests, to aid in the accurate diagnosis of pericarditis. - Collaborate with an interprofessional healthcare team to ensure monitoring for the recurrence of pericarditis and comprehensive management of pericarditis and its complications.
