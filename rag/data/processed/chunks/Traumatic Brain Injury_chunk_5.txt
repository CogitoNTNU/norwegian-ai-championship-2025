and a GCS of 15, both rules have a 100% sensitivity in predicting the need for neurosurgical intervention with the CCHR, resulting in lower CT rates (52% vs. 88%) and being more specific (50.6% vs. 12.7%).[34] Similar to the CCHR and NOC, the PECARN head injury rule has a 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in ruling out clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) in the pediatric population under two years of age. In those over two, the rules had a 96.8% sensitivity and negative predictive value of 99.95% for ruling out ciTBI but had a 100% sensitivity in predicting those requiring neurosurgical intervention.[36][37][36] If any of the criteria are met, a CT scan of the brain may be warranted. **New Orleans Criteria** - Headache - Vomiting (any) - Age > 60 years - Drug or alcohol intoxication - Seizure - Trauma visible above clavicles - Short-term memory deficits **Canadian CT Head Injury/Trauma Rule** - Dangerous mechanism of injury (defined as a pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, occupant ejected from a motor vehicle, or a fall from >3 feet or >5 stairs) - Vomiting > than once - Age > 65 years - GCS score < 15, 2 hours post-injury - Seizure after injury - Any sign of basal skull fracture - Possible open or depressed skull fracture - Amnesia for events 30 minutes before injury For pediatric patients (\<16) at low risk for intracranial injuries, the best decision tool to determine the recommendation of the CT scan is the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) head trauma algorithm, which is based on a large-scale clinical trial of the same name and has had repeated external validation.[38][36][38] **PECARN for children younger than 2 years old:** - Scalp hematomas (especially those that are not frontal) - Loss of consciousness for 5 seconds or more - Severe mechanism of injury (such as motor vehicle collision, fall from elevation greater than 3 feet, or being struck by a high-impact object) - Abnormal behavior, according to the parents, and palpable skull fracture **PECARN for children 2 years old and older:** - Loss of consciousness - Vomiting - Severe headache - Severe mechanism of injury - Signs of basilar skull fracture - Altered mental status There are many other trauma rules that can help risk stratify and help guide on prognosis and testing.
