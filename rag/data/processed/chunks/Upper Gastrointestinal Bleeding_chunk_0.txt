The anatomic landmark that separates upper and lower bleeds is the ligament of Treitz, also known as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum. This peritoneal structure suspends the duodenojejunal flexure from the retroperitoneum. Bleeding that originates above the ligament of Treitz usually presents either as hematemesis or melena whereas bleeding that originates below most commonly presents as hematochezia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Review the causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. - Describe the workup of a patient with upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. - Summarize the risk stratification tools to assess gastrointestinal bleeding. - Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.

The anatomic landmark that separates upper and lower bleeds is the ligament of Treitz, also known as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum. This peritoneal structure suspends the duodenojejunal flexure from the retroperitoneum. Bleeding that originates above the ligament of Treitz usually presents either as hematemesis or melena whereas bleeding that originates below most commonly presents as hematochezia. Hematemesis is the regurgitation of blood or blood mixed with stomach contents. Melena is dark, black, and tarry feces that typically has a strong characteristic odor caused by the digestive enzyme activity and intestinal bacteria on hemoglobin. Hematochezia is the passing of bright red blood via the rectum. ## Etiology The etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding is divided into upper gastrointestinal (GI) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. **Upper GI Bleeding** - Peptic ulcer disease (can be secondary to excess gastric acid, H. pylori infection, NSAID overuse, or physiologic stress) - Esophagitis - Gastritis and Duodenitis - Varices - Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) - Angiodysplasia - Dieulafoy lesion (bleeding dilated vessel that erodes through the gastrointestinal epithelium but has no primary
