The contents of Ringer's lactate include sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and lactate in the form of sodium lactate, mixed into a solution with an osmolarity of 273 mOsm/L and pH of about 6.5. In comparison, normal saline (NS) has an osmolarity of about 286 mOsm/L. Ringer's lactate is largely used in aggressive volume resuscitation from blood loss or burn injuries; however, Ringer's lactate is a great fluid for aggressive fluid replacement in many clinical situations, including sepsis and acute pancreatitis. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of Ringer's lactate, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. **Objectives:** - Explain the indications for using Ringer's lactate. - Describe the physiology behind the therapeutic effect of Ringer's lactate. - Summarize potential adverse effects from the use of Ringer's lactate. - Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Ringer's lactate use and improve patient outcomes.
