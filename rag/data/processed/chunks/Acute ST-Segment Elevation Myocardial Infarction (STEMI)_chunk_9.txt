and 74 is assigned 2 points. - Diabetes, hypertension, or a history of angina is assigned 1 point. - A systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg is assigned 3 points. - A heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is assigned 2 points. - Killip class II to IV is assigned 2 points. - A body weight less than 150 lbs is assigned 1 point. The TIMI score ranges from 0 to 14, with each point representing a different level of risk based on the patientâ€™s condition.[58] This scoring system helps predict mortality within the first 30 days following STEMI and is reliable for forecasting outcomes in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy.[59] Studies have applied the TIMI score to estimate mortality rates in anterior wall STEMI cases. The TIMI score can help classify patients based on risk categories. Risk levels are categorized as low for scores ranging from 0 to 4, medium for scores between 5 and 9, and high for scores above 9. Mortality rates at 30 days for patients presenting with STEMI are between 2.5% and 10%.[60][61][62] ## Complications Myocardial infarction has 3 life-threatening mechanical complications: ventricular free wall rupture, interventricular septum rupture, and acute mitral regurgitation. Ventricular free wall rupture occurs within 5 days in half the cases and 2 weeks in 90% of cases, with an overall mortality rate of greater than 80%.[63][64] Interventricular septum rupture is reported about half as often as free wall rupture and typically occurs in 3 to 5 days, with an overall mortality rate greater than 70%.[65][66] Prompt surgery reduces the mortality rate in both conditions. Acute mitral regurgitation following a myocardial infarction is most commonly due to ischemic papillary muscle displacement, left ventricular dilatation, or rupture of the papillary muscle or chordae. In STEMI, the degree of mitral regurgitation is usually severe and associated with a 30-day survival of 24%.[67] Inflammation of the pericardium, known as pericarditis, and pericardial effusion resulting from pericardial injury are collectively referred to as postcardiac injury syndrome. This syndrome includes conditions such as postmyocardial infarction, pericarditis (Dressler syndrome), postpericardiotomy syndrome, and posttraumatic pericarditis. Even minor injuries, like those from PCI, cardiac implantable electronic device placement, or radiofrequency ablation, can provoke cardiac injury. These conditions share a common trigger of pericardial or pleural damage, leading to a pleuropericardial syndrome characterized by pericarditis with pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.[68] ## Pearls and Other Issues Critical
