arteries, collateral circulation to the AV node is reduced, and the likelihood of heart block is increased. ## Complications The complications that can manifest with inferior myocardial infarctions are as follows: - Cardiogenic shock - Atrioventricular block - Need for pacing - Ventricular fibrillation ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Postoperative considerations and rehabilitation with inferior myocardial infarctions include: - Cardiac rehabilitation - Lowering blood pressure - Decreasing cholesterol and blood glucose - Maintaining a healthy body weight ## Deterrence and Patient Education Important points of patient education for preventing or managing inferior myocardial infarctions include: - Discontinuing smoking - Eating healthy - Regular exercise ## Pearls and Other Issues Heart blocks are present in approximately 9% of patients upon presentation, and two-thirds of patients who develop a high-degree heart block during the acute course of their inferior wall myocardial infarction do so during the first 24 hours. While heart blocks are a main contributor to morbidity and mortality, most high-degree heart blocks are treatable with atropine. It is seldom necessary to use a temporary pacemaker. The damaged myocardium can lead to potentially lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (see **Image.** Ischemic Ventricular Tachycardia in a Patient With an Old Inferior Myocardial Infarction). It is necessary to monitor these patients in a monitored setting, usually an intensive care unit, during the acute part of the event. When potentially lethal arrhythmias occur, early defibrillation is essential. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing an inferior wall myocardial infarction requires an interprofessional team of nurses, physicians, cardiac surgeons, and cardiologists. These patients are prone to life-threatening complications, and hence, prevention is the best approach. At discharge, the nurse should educate the patients about the potential need for pacing in the future. The dietitian should recommend a low-salt, low-fat diet. The patient should be enrolled in a cardiac rehab program. The pharmacist should encourage smoking cessation, medication compliance, and the reduction of blood cholesterol and glucose.[11][12][13] **Outcomes** When the RV is involved in an inferior wall myocardial infarction, it is an independent predictor of major complications and lengthening hospital stay. In addition, ischemia in the conducting pathways is disrupted, leading to a high degree of atrioventricular blockade that frequently requires pacing. The mortality rate when the RV is involved is often more than 25% compared to patients without RV involvement. In addition, even after discharge, many of these patients need permanent pacing
