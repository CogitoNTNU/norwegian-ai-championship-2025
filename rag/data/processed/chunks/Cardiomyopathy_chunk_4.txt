failure drugs have been proven to be beneficial in some studies. Some promising new treatments are targeting the pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of ACM such as myocyte hypertrophy, cell necrosis and fibrosis, and oxidative stress; however, these are still under investigation.[16][17] ## Differential Diagnosis - Constrictive cardiomyopathy - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy - Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy - Takatsubo cardiomyopathy - Drug-induced cardiomyopathy - Beriberi ## Prognosis Long-term survival is directly associated with both the amount of alcohol use and the duration of this usage. Alcohol-induced dilated cardiomyopathy has a better prognosis than ischemia-induced cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation, QRS widening of > 120 ms and absence of beta-blockers are associated with poor outcomes. Patients who continue to drink have a poor prognosis. Data suggests patients with successful quitting of alcohol have improved overall outcomes with a reduced number of inpatient admissions and improvement in diameter size on echocardiogram. Complications for those who continue to drink alcohol may include progressive heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardioembolic phenomenon. Data reveal that depending on the alcohol consumed, mortality rates of 40-80% are seen within 10 years. [5][18] ## Complications - Heart failure - Cachexia - Arrhythmias - Cardioembolism - Death ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is best managed with an interprofessional approach with the involvement of primary care physician and cardiology. The mainstay of management is providing support, resources including but not limited to alcoholic anonymous and encouragement for alcohol abstinence and address underlying stressors if any which requires assistance from nursing staff and pharmacy. These patients may also benefit from a dietary consult to assess nutrition. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18916&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18916) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/addiction/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy-alcohol-related-heart-damage/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=18916) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18916/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18916) [![Cardiac Dilated Cardiomyopathy Blausen](/books/NBK513322/bin/Cardiac__Dilated__Cardiomyopathy.gif)](/books/NBK513322/figure/article-18916.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK513322/figure/article-18916.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Cardiac Dilated Cardiomyopathy Blausen.com staff.
