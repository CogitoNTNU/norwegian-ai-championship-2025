In the United States, more than 1,000,000 cardiac catheterization procedures are performed annually. As expected, in any invasive procedure, there are some patient-related and procedure-related complications. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques of cardiac catheterization and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with CAD. **Objectives:** - Identify the technique of cardiac catheterization. - Describe the indications for cardiac catheterization. - Review the complications of cardiac catheterization. - Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.

In the United States, more than 1,000,000 cardiac catheterization procedures are performed annually.[1] As expected, in any invasive procedure, there are some patient-related and procedure-related complications. With significant advances in the equipment used for cardiac catheterization, the improved skill of the operators, and newer techniques, the rates of these complications have been reduced significantly. The term cardiac catheterization can refer to either right heart catheterization or left heart catheterization, or both. The procedure can be either diagnostic or therapeutic, and interventional cardiologists can perform a variety of interventions depending on the clinical need. This review briefly reviews the expected risks and complications for a routine, diagnostic, cardiac catheterization procedure. ## Indications Cardiac catheterization can be either a diagnostic or a therapeutic procedure. The procedure is done in the evaluation and the treatment of the following conditions. - Coronary artery disease - Measuring the hemodynamics in the right and left side of the heart - Evaluate the left ventricular function - Evaluation and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias - Evaluation and treatment of valvular heart disease - Assessment pericardial and myocardial diseases - Assessment of the congenital heart diseases - Evaluation of heart failure ## Contraindications There are no absolute definitive contraindications for cardiac catheterization procedures. Most of the contraindications are relative depending on the indication for the procedure and the
