This condition often results from aspiration during episodes of altered consciousness, with alcoholism being a common predisposing factor. Lung abscesses may be acute (resolving in \<6 weeks) or chronic (persisting for >6 weeks) and are categorized as primary when resulting from oropharyngeal secretion aspiration or secondary when arising from pulmonary conditions, including bronchial obstructions (eg, tumors or foreign bodies) and existing lung conditions (eg, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or lung contusions). Lung abscesses may also arise from hematogenous spread of an extrapulmonary pathology. Early symptoms mimic pneumonia, including fever, chills, cough, night sweats, and chest pain, with a productive cough developing as a hallmark sign. Diagnostic studies such as chest radiographs, computed tomography scans, sputum examination, and bronchoscopy are crucial for identifying the causative agents and differentiating lung abscesses from other conditions, including cavitary tuberculosis and lung carcinoma. Treatment typically involves broad-spectrum antibiotics, with surgical interventions like drainage or pulmonary resection reserved for specific cases. Complications can include pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema, especially in immunocompromised patients. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's recognition of the underlying etiology and clinical features of lung abscesses, as well as competence in the diagnostic evaluation and appropriate management of patients with a lung abscess to improve outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify lung abscess etiologies. - Select the appropriate diagnostic studies to evaluate a patient with a lung abscess. - Implement the indicated management for a lung abscess. - Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes for patients with a lung abscess.

Once a bronchopulmonary fistula develops, this cavity often exhibits an air-fluid level. Lung abscesses belong to the broader category of lung infections, including lung gangrene and necrotizing pneumonia,
