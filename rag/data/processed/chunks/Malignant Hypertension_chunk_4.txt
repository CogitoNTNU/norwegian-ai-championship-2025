of chronic management. Despite optimal medical management, many patients still experience some degree of exercise intolerance, and others develop irreversible pulmonary hypertension and require pulmonary transplantation.[13] After transplantation, patients have a median survival of 10.7 years.[13] If unsuccessful, various palliative procedures can aid in maximizing right ventricular cardiac output. Few long-term studies have assessed the prognosis of HAPH. Some research suggests that mean pulmonary artery pressures can normalize in as little as 2 years after descent to lower altitudes but can increase with a return to high elevation.[1] ## Complications The most common complication of the condition is exercise intolerance, which most patients experience to some degree, regardless of optimized treatment and therapy. More severe complications of the condition include the advancement of the disease, right ventricular failure, and death.[13] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patient education is essential for the successful management of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with the appropriate medications and the patient's understanding of the importance of adherence to the regimen provides the greatest likelihood of the best clinical outcome. Healthcare providers should work with patients to help them manage their expectations for treatment outcomes. Some patients still experience significant exercise intolerance and may ultimately require pulmonary transplantation. Patients with HAPH should understand that pulmonary artery pressures can improve with a return to lower altitudes. If the disease's progression and severity are understood, urging the patient to return can significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes HAPH is a life-threatening condition. Optimal patient outcomes are achieved through early recognition and treatment. During the initial acute presentation of symptoms, healthcare team members need to recognize the signs of pulmonary hypertension, treat them symptomatically, and investigate with the proper modalities to diagnose HAPH. Primary care providers who serve communities at high altitudes also serve an important role in providing information on the condition and patient education. It is vital to have a high index of suspicion for altitude-related illness and HAPH since early detection and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis. Patients suffering from HAPH should be strongly urged to descend to lower elevations to lower their pulmonary artery pressures. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28035&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28035) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/altitude-induced-pulmonary-hypertension/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28035) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28035/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28035) ## References 1.
