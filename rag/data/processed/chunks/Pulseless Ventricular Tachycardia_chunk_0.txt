This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the epidemiology of pulseless ventricular tachycardia. - Review the pathophysiology of pulseless ventricular tachycardia. - Outline the treatment and management options available for pulseless ventricular tachycardia. - Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and improve outcomes.

Pulseless ventricular tachycardia is a medical emergency. Due to rapid ventricular contractions, the ventricular filling decreases markedly, leading to a dramatic decrease in cardiac output. As a result, a pulse is absent. Electrophysiology identifying factors for pulseless ventricular tachycardia include; tachycardia (>100 bpm), wide QRS complexes (> 120 milliseconds), atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, presence of fusion or capture beats and an electrical axis between -90 to -180. There are several scoring systems to differentiate ventricular tachycardia from a wide complex supraventricular tachycardia, but 90% of wide complex tachycardia cases will be ventricular tachycardia. The ventricular arrhythmia can be characterized as either monomorphic (no variation of the QRS from beat to beat) or polymorphic (changing or multiform QRS from beat to beat). The most common cause of pulseless ventricular tachycardia is cardiac ischemia.[1] ## Etiology Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) can result from a multitude of causes and predisposing conditions, including but not limited to, structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, drugs/medications, and congenital/inherited channelopathies.[1] The most common cause of ventricular tachycardia (including pulseless VT) is concomitant structural heart disease. Below are several examples organized into the following categories: Structural Heart Disease: - coronary artery disease - aortic stenosis - cardiomyopathy - congestive heart failure - hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) - myocardial infarction (MI) Electrolyte Disturbances: - hypokalemia -
