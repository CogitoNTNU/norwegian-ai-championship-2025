the pathophysiology of burns. Optimizing the care of this complex population may require interdisciplinary collaboration and a myriad of services. A retrospective study involving a Difficult Airway Response Team (DART) composed of anesthesiologists, otolaryngologists, and trauma surgeons as a multidisciplinary approach to difficult airways found that a team-based approach was able to secure the airway more often without the need for an emergency cricothyrotomy in a statistically significant manner.[21] Applying a multidisciplinary approach to a burn patient with a difficult airway can lead to a safer and less harmful method of securing the airway. The Parkland Formula is a valuable tool for estimating the necessary amount of fluid resuscitation for a burn patient. However, relying solely on this number for calculating the administration of isotonic fluid can be prone to human errors. Accidentally forgetting to include fluid volumes from intravenous medications is a common issue. Burn patients must receive the correct amount of fluid resuscitation as too little fluid is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Too much fluid is associated with fluid creep, which can lead to higher rates of infection and intubation.[1][2] A retrospective review of burn patients found that patients actually receive much higher volumes of fluid than estimated by the Parkland Formula to properly fluid resuscitate a burn patient.[22] Effective team communication can help prevent fluid creep and its associated issues. Nursing staff plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate intake and output recording and can provide essential feedback to physicians and advanced practice clinicians when significant volumes of medications, such as antibiotics, sedation, and electrolyte replacement, are being infused. These fluid volumes are often overlooked when calculating fluid resuscitation goals, making the nursing staff's vigilance and communication vital for effective patient care. The anesthesiologist and critical care physician collaborate with the surgeons to make adjustments in fluid delivery so surgical sites or respiratory function are not compromised. Effective communication among team members is key to improving outcomes for this complex subset of patients without the need to alter the currently available therapies. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=132872&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=132872) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/anesthesia/anesthesia-for-patients-with-burns-anesthesia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=132872) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/132872/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=132872) ## References 1.
