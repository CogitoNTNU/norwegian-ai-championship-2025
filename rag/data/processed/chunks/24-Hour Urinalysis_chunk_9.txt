in all laboratories. As an alternative, the biochemical marker creatinine in serum and urine is commonly used to estimate GFR.[25] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Renal Function Tests](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28359)," for further information. Creatinine is the anhydride product of creatinine and is directly related to muscle mass.[10] Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma cleared of creatinine per unit time and provides a rapid, cost-effective method for assessing renal function. CrCl and GFR can be estimated using urine creatinine, serum creatinine, and urine volume collected over a specific period. However, because the peritubular capillaries secrete creatinine, CrCl tends to overestimate GFR by about 10% to 20%. Despite this margin of error, CrCl remains an accepted method for measuring GFR due to its ease of measurement.[26] CrCl is calculated using the equation: - CrCl= (UCr × V) / PCr CrCl = creatinine clearance; UCr= urinary creatinine concentration (mg/dL); V= urinary flow rate (volume/time in mL/min); and PCr= plasma creatinine concentration (mg/dL). Urea clearance, similar to creatinine clearance, is used to estimate renal function: - Clur= (Uur × V) / Pur Clur= urea clearance; Uur= urinary urea concentration (mg/dL); V= urinary flow rate (volume/time in mL/min); and Pur= plasma urea concentration (mg/dL).

Accurate collections can identify treatable abnormalities predisposing individuals to stone formation and help monitor treatment effectiveness. Since urinary constituents can vary significantly based on diet and lifestyle, their interpretation can be complex and often subjective. More than 90% of patients with kidney stones will exhibit at least 1 suboptimal chemical disorder. While 24-hour urine testing alone does not cure nephrolithiasis, it helps guide effective prophylactic treatment for patients committed to adhering to long-term therapeutic guidelines. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](/pubmed/29494055)," for a more detailed guide to interpreting 24-hour urine testing for kidney stone prophylaxis analysis and therapy. According to the American Urological Association guidelines, 24-hour urine testing should be offered to all patients with nephrolithiasis, regardless of symptoms. This is especially recommended for pediatric and high-risk individuals and those highly motivated to adhere to long-term prophylactic treatment recommendations.[27][28][29][30] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety Nomograms for creatinine excretion based on age, weight, sex, and sometimes ethnicity have been developed to compare expected
