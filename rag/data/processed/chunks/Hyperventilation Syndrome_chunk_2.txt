disease, including pregnancy, ascites, ileus, intra-abdominal sepsis, and large-volume fluid resuscitation.[10] Intra-abdominal pressures can be chronically elevated in pregnancy, cirrhosis, obesity, intra-abdominal malignancy, and peritoneal dialysis.[6][11][12][13] Those with higher body mass index can be expected to have higher baseline IAP between 9 to 14 mm Hg due to the restrictive effect of adipose tissue.[14] The causes of IAH and ACS can be broken down into the following categories:[15][16][17] **Diminished abdominal wall compliance:** abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal adhesions, major trauma, major burns, mechanical ventilation, obesity. **Increased intraluminal volume:** gastroparesis, gastric distension, ileus, constipation, toxic megacolon, volvulus. **Increased extraluminal abdominal volume:** hemoperitoneum, pneumoperitoneum, severe pancreatitis, liver failure with ascites, retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal tumors, intra-abdominal abscesses, laparoscopy with excessive insufflation pressures, peritoneal dialysis. **Capillary leak/fluid resuscitation:** damage control surgery, bacteremia, systemic inflammation, coagulopathy, sepsis, massive fluid administration, blood product transfusion. ## Epidemiology ACS can develop in all ICU and critically ill patients. The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Intra-Abdominal Hypertension in Critically Ill Patients (IROI Study) was a prospective study that revealed 34% of patients to have IAH on the day of admission, which increased to 48.9% within 14 days. The development of IAH within the observed period was associated with mortality.[18] In another identified series of mixed ICU populations, 32% of patients were found to have IAH and 4% to have ACS.[19] ## Pathophysiology Elevated intra-abdominal pressures can affect multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.[20][21] **Cardiovascular System** The cardiovascular system can be affected in multiple ways due to elevated IAP. IAH can cause compression of the inferior vena cava, reducing venous blood return to the heart and causing lower extremity edema. Decreased venous return can also lead to reduced cardiac output, resulting in less blood and oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Additionally, the increased IAP causes the diaphragm to move upwards, which raises the intra-thoracic pressures and places direct pressure on the heart, ultimately decreasing ventricular compliance. **Pulmonary System** Elevated intrathoracic pressures limit pulmonary compliance, thus decreasing tidal volume and functional residual capacity and increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Airway pressures increase, and patients can have difficulties ventilating. Alveoli exhibit atelectasis, increasing the dead space. Thus, gas exchange is adversely affected as less oxygen is transported and more carbon dioxide is retained, leading to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. **Renal System** IAH can compromise the renal system by decreasing renal arterial and venous blood flow, affecting the glomerular filtration
