is discharged from the hospital after a resolved pneumothorax, recommendations should be made for no flying or scuba diving for a minimum of two weeks. Patients with a known history of spontaneous pneumothorax should not be medically cleared for occupations involving flying or scuba diving. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The emergency department physician often does the management of pneumothorax. In some cases, the disorder may be managed by the ICU staff and the thoracic surgeon. The nurse does the care of patients who have a chest tube. All nurses who manage patients with a chest tube should know how a chest drain functions. Patients need to be examined every shift and the patency of the chest tube is important. Patients with small pneumothorax can be observed if they have no symptoms. If discharged the patient should be seen within 24 hours. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27370&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27370) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/pneumothorax/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27370) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27370/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27370) [![Image ](/books/NBK441885/bin/Deep_Sulcus_Sign.gif)](/books/NBK441885/figure/article-27370.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK441885/figure/article-27370.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Portable Chest Radiograph, Left Deep Sulcus Pneumothorax Contributed by S Dulebohn, MD [![Right Tension Pneumothorax Radiograph](/books/NBK441885/bin/tension__ptx__x2x.gif)](/books/NBK441885/figure/article-27370.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK441885/figure/article-27370.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Right Tension Pneumothorax Radiograph.
