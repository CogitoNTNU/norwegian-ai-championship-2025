(6.3%).[26] Contrarily, data derived from Olmstead County in Minnesota demonstrated a decrease of 28% in the incidence of HFpEF diagnoses between 2000 and 2010.[23] While it is clear that the overall prevalence of heart failure is increasing globally, the incidence and prevalence of heart failure demonstrate significant geographic differences. However, data are lacking from some geographic areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and differences in diagnostic criteria and reporting practices across the globe limit the accuracy of comparative data. Despite these limitations, when available data are derived from studies that define HFpEF as an ejection fraction of â‰¥50%, stark geographic differences in prevalence emerge. Shiga et al. reported an HFpEF prevalence of 43% in 1245 patients with heart failure hospitalized in Japan between 2013 and 2014.[28] Wang et al. evaluated 5236 patients in a community-based heart failure management program in Australia and reported a 37.4% prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses.[29] In contrast, the prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses in the European Society of Cardiology long-term registry and Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Registry was only 16%.[30] ## Pathophysiology The clinical manifestations of HFpEF are ultimately due to complex pathophysiological processes in cardiomyocyte structure and function, resulting in hemodynamic derangements.[2] However, the pathophysiology of HFpEF is likely not limited to the cardiomyocyte (see **Image.** Pathophysiology of Heart Failure). Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of HFpEF.[31] Obesity is a chronic systemic inflammatory state that induces hemodynamic derangements and hormonal abnormalities that stress the cardiovascular system.[32] Overweight and obese individuals demonstrate subclinical changes in the structure and function of the left ventricle, even in the presence of a normal ejection fraction.[33] Increased adiposity is associated with worsening left ventricular diastolic function regardless of left ventricular mass.[34] Central obesity is associated with age-related increases in ventricular end-systolic elastance in women but not in men; obesity and female sex are significant risk factors for the development of HFpEF.[35] Additionally, right ventricular function is impaired in patients with HFpEF; right ventricular dysfunction is more marked in obese patients with HFpEF than in those with a normal body mass index.[36][37][38] Integral to the pathophysiology of HFpEF is the concept of diminished physiologic reserve.[2] Abnormalities in skeletal muscle and vascular endothelium significantly contribute to decreased reserve. Exercise tolerance and capacity are decreased in patients with HFpEF, as demonstrated by more severe dyspnea and fatigue at matched workloads than controls.[39] This appears particularly true in older
