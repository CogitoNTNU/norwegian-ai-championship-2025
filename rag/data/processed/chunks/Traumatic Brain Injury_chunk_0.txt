TBI can generally be classified as closed or penetrating, with the latter distinguished by a violation of the skull and dura mater. Of the two types, closed head injury (CHI) is far more common. The different types of CHI can be broken down to include concussion, contusion, diffuse axonal injury, and intracranial hematoma (epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage). This activity will focus only on traumatic brain injury, with the terms TBI and closed head injury being used interchangeably. This activity describes the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injury and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the common etiologies of traumatic brain injury. - Properly outline the appropriate acute evaluation and assessment of those suffering from a traumatic brain injury. - Review and apply the current treatment and management options available for those suffering a traumatic brain injury. - Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care for traumatic brain injury and improve outcomes.

This article primarily addresses those suffering from a traumatic brain injury or closed head injury, which is the most common form of TBI, rather than a penetrating head injury. The various types of closed head injuries include conditions like concussion, parenchymal contusions, and various types of intracranial hematomas. In the United States, TBI affects approximately 1.7 million individuals annually, with a noticeable prevalence among older adolescents (ages 15 to 19 years old) and adults over the age of 65. These injuries frequently impact the frontal and temporal brain regions, leading to substantial healthcare burdens, particularly in lower-income countries.[1][2][3][4] TBI severity is classified into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild TBI or concussion is clinically defined as a loss of consciousness lasting \<30 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia lasting \<24 hrs,
