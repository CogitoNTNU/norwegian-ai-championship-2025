system.[11] However, posterior mediastinal air, the involvement of all mediastinal compartments, and concomitant hemothorax are associated with increased mortality in blunt trauma patients.[12] ## Treatment / Management Most patients with pneumomediastinum diagnosed on imaging studies ultimately prove not to have serious mediastinal organ injury and only require symptomatic management, as spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually self-limited and rarely recurs.[8] These patients are typically well-appearing and hemodynamically stable. Treatment in these patients includes bed rest, oxygen administration as needed, antitussives, and analgesia. Prophylactic antibiotics are not typically needed in spontaneous pneumomediastinum but may be indicated in patients with aerodigestive injury secondary to trauma or instrumentation.[13] Most spontaneous pneumomediastinum patients can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up or admitted for brief inpatient observation.[3] Similarly, blunt trauma patients with isolated pneumomediastinum may also be able to be managed conservatively.[14] In patients who are in distress, febrile, or with concern for secondary pneumomediastinum, hospital admission is indicated for observation, additional diagnostic testing, or surgery. Those with emesis, dysphagia, associated traumatic injuries, hemodynamic instability, pleural effusion, signs of infection, or pneumoperitoneum should undergo a contrast swallow study.[2][14] Patients with extensive subcutaneous emphysema may necessitate surgical decompression, and those with pneumothorax may require chest tube placement. Finally, in patients presenting with malignant pneumomediastinum, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or thoracotomy may be necessary.[3] ## Differential Diagnosis The\*\*\*\* clinical features of pneumomediastinum mimic other diseases of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Following differentials should be considered while evaluating a patient with pneumomediastinum. **Cardiac** - Acute coronary syndrome - Pericarditis - Myocarditis - Pneumopericardium **Pulmonary** - Pleuritis - Pulmonary embolism - Pneumothorax - Pneumonia - Traumatic tracheal rupture **Gastrointestinal** - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Pancreatitis - Esophageal rupture **Musculoskeletal** - Costochondritis - Sternal and rib contusions - Rib fractures **Others** - Malignancy - Sickle cell crisis ## Prognosis Although recurrent pneumomediastinum is a risk, it is usually benign and morbidity and mortality are primarily attributable to the precipitating cause. Most cases of pneumomediastinum are self-resolving and require only symptomatic treatment or observation. ## Complications Other air-leak syndromes in particular pneumothorax, extensive subcutaneous emphysema, malignant pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium can complicate pneumomediastinum.[3] Tension pneumomediastinum may occur, leading to compression of great vessels and compromising venous return, which can cause hypotension and hypoxemia secondary to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Other complications may be specific to the cause (i.e., mediastinitis in patients with a perforated esophagus). ## Deterrence and Patient Education Most cases of pneumomediastinum are
