small bowel, leading to motility dysfunction. Enteric neuropathy, caused by neurological or metabolic conditions (eg, diabetes or Parkinson disease), can also disrupt normal motility, presenting with symptoms similar to mechanical SBO. Proper diagnosis requires imaging and sometimes specialized tests to differentiate functional obstructions from mechanical causes, and treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition and supporting motility. **Rare Causes** Small bowel encapsulation is a rare cause of SBO. In this condition, the small intestine is encased by a fibrous membrane within the peritoneum, limiting its movement and potentially causing obstruction. This condition can present as acute or chronic SBO, often requiring imaging such as CT scans for diagnosis.[16] Encapsulation can result from congenital conditions or be secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes. Small bowel volvulus is another uncommon cause, where the bowel twists around its mesentery, obstructing blood flow and causing ischemia. Volvulus can occur anywhere in the small bowel but is more common in the midgut; this leads to bowel distention, pain, and potentially ischemia or necrosis if not treated promptly. Volvulus may be associated with abnormal intestinal mobility or congenital malformations, like malrotation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through radiographic imaging (ie, CT or contrast studies), and surgical intervention is often required to untwist the bowel and prevent ischemia. **Pediatric** Congenital or acquired adhesions are the most common causes of SBO. The second most common cause is intussusception. Other causes include congenital atresia, volvulus, ingestion of foreign bodies, and Meckel diverticulum.[17] ## Epidemiology SBO is a common surgical emergency, contributing to 15% to 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain and accounting for approximately 80% of all bowel obstructions. Each year, over 300,000 laparotomies are performed in the United States for SBO. The incidence of SBO is closely associated with the prevalence of abdominal surgeries, as postoperative adhesions are the leading cause, responsible for more than 75% of cases.[18] The risk of SBO increases with the number of prior intraabdominal procedures, emphasizing the importance of surgical history in assessing patient risk. SBO is observed across all age groups but is more common in older adults due to higher rates of abdominal surgeries, malignancies, and hernias. Sex differences in etiology are evident, with women more prone to adhesion-related SBO due to gynecological procedures, while men are more likely to experience hernia-related obstruction. In low-resource settings, hernias are a predominant cause due to limited access to elective hernia repair surgeries.
