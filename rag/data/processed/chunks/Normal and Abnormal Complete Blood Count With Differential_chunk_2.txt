smear examination rather than depending on a single parameter. MCV may be spuriously elevated in the setting of: - Red cell agglutination, where doublet erythrocytes are automatically counted as one - Hyperglycemia occurs when an excess of glucose causes hypertonic erythrocytes to swell, increasing RBC volume within the counting medium. - Hypernatremia is due to the swelling of hypertonic erythrocytes. - Hyperleucocytosis, where the larger white cells are counted as red cells when calculating mean cell volume.[4][13] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table1/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table1/?report=objectonly) Table 2. Classification of Anemia by MCV and RDW. . **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin** Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) quantifies the amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell and is expressed as picograms per cell (pg/cell). The value is calculated by dividing hemoglobin by red cell count. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 27 to 32 pg/RBC. MCH is dependent on cell volume and correlates closely with MCV. Conversely, the CBC also includes the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which controls for cell volume and is useful in evaluating anemia. **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrate** MCHC is the mean hemoglobin concentration per unit volume of red blood cells, expressed as a gram per deciliter (g/dl) or percentage of Hb per cell. The value is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit. While MCH quantifies the amount of hemoglobin, MCHC indicates the hemoglobin density in each red cell, controlling for MCV. Red blood cell quantity of Hb is regulated and is normally limited to an optimal density of approximately 34% Hb/cell. Hypochromia refers to a low MCHC, while normochromic describes a normal MCHC. Hypochromic anemia may be due to decreased Hb production, the most common cause being iron deficiency (less commonly copper deficiency, pyridoxine deficiency, or lead poisoning), or due to reticulocytosis, as reticulocytes have a lower concentration of Hb compared to mature red blood cells. Increased MCHC can be due to red blood cell morphology abnormalities, such as spherocytosis and xerocytosis or hemoglobinopathies. More commonly, high MCHC represents an artifact such as in the following: - Lipemia, which spuriously elevates Hb and consequently MCHC - Hemolysis, where Hb is disproportionally elevated to Hct within the sample - Red cell agglutination, which spuriously lowers the red cell concentration and elevates MCV - Leukocytosis, which spuriously elevates MCV - Hyperbilirubinemia, which spuriously lowers Hb Examination of a peripheral blood smear is useful in such a case to evaluate red blood
