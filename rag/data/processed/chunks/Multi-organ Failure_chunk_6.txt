College Criteria for ALF due to acetaminophen overdose and ALF not associated with acetaminophen. Other useful prognostic criteria include Clichy criteria (presence of hepatic encephalopathy along with a factor V level lower than 20% to 30% of normal, MELD score higher than 30, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score higher than 15.[13][14] ## Pearls and Other Issues Patients with acute liver failure and fulminant Wilson disease receive the highest priority for liver transplantation in the United States. They are assigned Status 1A category on the liver transplant waitlist due to their risk for the highest mortality in the absence of liver transplantation. Contraindications to liver transplantation in ALF include multiorgan failure or severe cardiopulmonary disease, septic shock, extrahepatic malignancy, irreversible brain injury or brain death, severe thrombotic disorder, active substance abuse, multiple suicide attempts, and lack of social support. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Because there are many causes of ALF and its management is complex, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a dietitian, hematologist, liver specialist, gastroenterologist, surgeon, radiologist, pathologist, and an intensivist. The management of ALF consists of supportive care, prevention, and management of complications, specific treatment when the exact etiology is known, and determination of prognosis and the need for liver support including possible liver transplantation. All patients should be hospitalized, preferably at a center that has facilities and expertise for a liver transplant. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on no medication that can worsen liver function and should continuously monitor the medications for drug-drug interactions. The treatment of ALF depends on the cause but at the same time, all patients need aggressive hydration. Since these patients develop a range of complications, the relevant specialist should be consulted promptly. Some patients may benefit from a liver transplant or extracorporeal liver-assist device. The outlook for patients with ALF depends on the cause, extent of liver damage, comorbidity, response to treatment, the age of the patient, and the number of organs involved.[15][16] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=24369&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=24369) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/acute-liver-failure-liver-failure/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=24369) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/24369/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=24369) ## References 1.
