exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach. Some of these circumstances include: - Influenza season: During the influenza season, rapid testing for influenza may be recommended in specific patient populations. This population includes individuals at a heightened risk of complications, such as older individuals, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. Healthcare workers who develop respiratory symptoms may also benefit from rapid testing to determine the presence of influenza and assess the appropriateness of the antiviral treatment. - Viral pandemics: In the context of viral pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid testing becomes essential for diagnosing and managing the infection. Swift identification of cases is imperative for promptly implementing appropriate infection control measures, timely administration of treatment, and prevention of further viral transmission. - High suspicion of pertussis or bacterial infections: When a strong clinical suspicion of pertussis (whooping cough) or other bacterial respiratory infections arises, rapid testing proves valuable in confirming the diagnosis. Such testing can serve as a guide for initiating antibiotic treatment, thereby aiding in the containment of further transmission. Multiplex polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates is a diagnostic tool that allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single test. This method helps diagnose infections attributed to specific bacteria, such as _B_ _pertussis_ (the causative agent of whooping cough), _M_ _pneumoniae_ , or _C_ _pneumonia_.[22] The advantage of multiplex PCR testing lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify the presence of these bacterial pathogens in respiratory samples, facilitating the differentiation of various causes of respiratory infections. By detecting the target bacteria's genetic material (DNA or RNA), PCR testing provides a sensitive and specific diagnosis, especially when compared to traditional culture methods, which may have sensitivity and turnaround time limitations. However, it remains essential to ensure this testing approach is adequately validated and employed within a comprehensive clinical assessment context. This approach provides an accurate interpretation of results and supports sound decision-making regarding patient management. Gram stain and bacterial sputum cultures are typically discouraged in acute bronchitis cases, as bacteria seldom serve as the causative agent. Assessing procalcitonin levels can be a valuable tool in determining whether antibiotics should be prescribed when the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is uncertain. A meta-analysis has shown that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy reduced antibiotic exposure and improved overall survival.[23] Spirometry, when performed,
