suspected myocarditis, approximately 25% exhibited reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or symptoms of low cardiac output. On physical examination, findings typically correlate with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. In patients with decompensated heart failure, signs may include an S3 gallop, pulmonary rales, jugular venous distension, and peripheral edema. A pericardial friction rub may be heard in cases with pericardial involvement. A pansystolic murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation may be present in patients with ventricular dilation. Additional findings may point toward systemic disease, depending on the underlying etiology. For example, lymphadenopathy may indicate sarcoidosis; a maculopapular rash may suggest eosinophilic myocarditis; and features such as erythema marginatum, polyarthralgia, chorea, and subcutaneous nodules are characteristic of acute rheumatic fever. Dysphagia may be observed in Chagas disease, while diphtheritic myocarditis can be associated with neurologic manifestations. ## Evaluation The ACC recommends a structured 5-step approach for evaluating and diagnosing acute myocarditis. This framework integrates clinical judgment with targeted diagnostic tools to ensure a comprehensive and systematic assessment. - Step 1—Initial evaluation: When acute myocarditis is clinically suspected, the first step involves obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, cardiac biomarkers, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a transthoracic echocardiogram. Evaluation should also aim to identify or rule out underlying CAD when clinically indicated. - Step 2—Clinical triage: Patients should be triaged based on hemodynamic stability and symptom severity to determine the need for hospitalization, urgent referral to an advanced heart failure center, immediate arrhythmia management, or mechanical circulatory support. - Step 3—Definitive diagnostics: Cardiac MRI with T1 and T2 mapping is the key diagnostic tool essential for evaluating myocardial inflammation and injury. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should be considered in selected cases, particularly when the diagnosis is unclear or when specific histopathological subtypes are suspected. - Step 4—Therapeutic management: Management includes discontinuing the inciting agent, addressing the underlying cause, treating any arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, and enforcing temporary restrictions on strenuous activity, including competitive sports. - Step 5—Longitudinal surveillance: Follow-up involves serial monitoring with cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI with tissue mapping. When indicated, genetic counseling and testing should be incorporated. A comprehensive reevaluation is essential before clearing patients for return to high-intensity physical activity or competitive sports. According to the 2013 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and subsequent updates, a diagnosis of acute myocarditis is suspected when at least 1 clinical presentation is accompanied by a diagnostic finding
