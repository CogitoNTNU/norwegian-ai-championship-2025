distress or impending respiratory failure. \*\*_Cardiovascular_ \*\* The blood pressure and heart rate might be high in the beginning, but patients might suffer a cardiovascular collapse with ensuing hypotension \*\*_Central nervous system_ \*\* \_\_ A Glasgow Coma Scale assessment of less than 8 indicates that the airway should be secured and the patient placed on mechanical ventilation. Symptoms involving the central nervous system in FES are thought to arise from cerebral edema rather than cerebral ischemia. \*\*_Skin_ \*\* \_\_ Usually, a petechial rash on the skin with all the risk above factors should alert the clinician about FES. \*\*_Eye_ \*\* \_\_ A fundoscopic examination is necessary to check for the presence of retinal hemorrhage. ## Evaluation Diagnosis of FES can be very challenging because the signs and symptoms can be vague. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria. Based on experience and research, several authors have proposed diagnostic criteria for FES.[3][4][5] Gurd et al in 1970 and later Wilson in 1974 put forward the following diagnostic criteria: 2 major criteria or at least one major criteria and 4 minor criteria. **Major Criteria** - Petechial rash - Respiratory insufficiency - Cerebral involvement in non-head injury patients **Minor Criteria** - Fever greater than 38.5 C - Tachycardia heart rate greater than 110 beats per minute - Retinal involvement - Jaundice - Renal signs - Anemia - Thrombocytopenia - High erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Fat macroglobulinemia **Schoenfeld Criteria** Another report by Schoenfeld et al proposed a quantitative means for diagnosing FES. A cumulative score greater than 5 is required for the diagnosis. - 5 points - petechiae rash - 4 points - diffuse infiltrate on x-ray - 3 points - hypoxemia - 1 point (for each) - fever, tachycardia, confusion **Lindeque Criteria** Lastly, Lindegue et al suggested using respiratory symptoms alone as the diagnostic criteria for FES. This criterion has not gained worldwide acceptance compared to the Gurd, Wilson, and Schoenfeld criteria. - Sustained Pa02 less than 8 kilopascal - Sustained PC02 greater than 7.3 kilopascal - Sustained respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute despite sedation - Dyspnea, increased work of breathing, anxiety, tachycardia **Ancillary Studies** Apart from the aforementioned diagnostic criteria, other ancillary studies are needed to aid in the diagnostic workup, including the following: \*\*_Complete blood count_ \*\* Anemia and thrombocytopenia are very common in FES. \*\*_Comprehensive metabolic panel_ \*\* Metabolic acidosis, increased levels of BUN, and creatinine can
