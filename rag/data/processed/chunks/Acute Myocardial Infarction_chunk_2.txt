## Histopathology The histological changes observed in MI evolve throughout the disease course. At time 0, no microscopic histologic changes are observed. Within 0.5 to 4 hours, light microscopy reveals the waviness of fibers at the tissue periphery along with glycogen depletion. At 4 to 12 hours, the myocardium undergoes coagulation necrosis and edema. At 12 to 24 hours, the gross specimen appears dark and mottled, with contraction band necrosis and neutrophil predominance observed on histopathology. Subsequently, nuclei reduction occurs between 1 to 3 days, and then, within the next 3 to 7 days, macrophages emerge to clear apoptotic cells. Granulation tissue appears at 7 to 10 days, and collagen type I deposition occurs after 10 days. Ultimately, after 2 months, the myocardium undergoes scarring. ## History and Physical The history and physical examination alone may not always diagnose AMI definitively. The history should focus on the onset, quality, and associated symptoms. Recent studies suggest that diaphoresis and bilateral arm radiating pain are more commonly associated with MI in men. Other associated symptoms may include the following: - Lightheadedness - Anxiety - Cough - Choking sensation - Diaphoresis - Wheezing - Irregular heart rate The physical examination should include the patientâ€™s vital signs and appearance, including diaphoresis, pulmonary evaluation, and cardiac auscultation. Specific vital aspects of the examination are as follows: - **Heart rate:** Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular arrhythmia may be present, indicating cardiac electrical disturbances. - **Pulses:** Unequal pulses may be observed if the patient has an aortic dissection, indicating a potential arterial problem. - **Blood pressure:** Blood pressure is typically high in AMI but may become hypotensive if the patient is in shock due to compromised cardiac function. - **Respiratory findings:** Tachypnea and fever may be present, indicating an inflammatory response. - **Neck veins:** Distended neck veins may be observed, suggesting right ventricular failure and increased central venous pressure. - **Cardiac findings:** The heart may exhibit lateral displacement of the apical impulse, a soft S1 sound, a palpable S4 sound, and a new mitral regurgitation murmur. A loud holosystolic murmur radiating to the sternum may indicate ventricular septal rupture. - **Pulmonary findings:** Wheezing and rales may be heard if the patient has developed pulmonary edema, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs. - **Extremities:** Edema or cyanosis may be present in the extremities, with a sensation of coldness due to compromised circulation. ## Evaluation Early and prompt ECG
