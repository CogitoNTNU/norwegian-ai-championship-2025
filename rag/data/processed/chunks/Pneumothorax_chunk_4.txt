be considered when diagnosing patients with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.[14] Similarly, traumatic pneumothorax must be suspected in any case of blunt or penetrating chest trauma. The diagnostic approach varies depending on the clinical scenario. An upright chest radiograph is typically the preferred initial imaging study. However, tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, as waiting for imaging can delay life-saving treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly used to evaluate pneumothorax. This modality offers greater accuracy compared to chest x-rays while avoiding radiation exposure.[30]\*\*\*\* Ultrasound is particularly valuable in critically ill patients and situations requiring rapid bedside assessment. **Classification Based on Size** The distinction between small and large pneumothoraces is based on the distance between the lung margin and the chest wall on imaging: [31] - Small pneumothorax: Visible rim less than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. - Large pneumothorax: Visible rim greater than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. Chest x-rays underestimate the size of pneumothorax and may also reveal other findings, such as hydropneumothorax (air and fluid levels in the pleural space), particularly when obtained in the upright position.[32] In cases where clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative chest x-ray, a CT scan can provide a more accurate assessment of pneumothorax size and detect subtle or loculated air collections that may not be visible on standard radiographs. Bilateral pneumothorax, sometimes called buffalo chest, can be either congenital or iatrogenic. The iatrogenic form typically occurs as a result of thoracic surgical procedures that compromise the anterior connection between the chest cavities. This condition is commonly observed in patients who have undergone lung or heart transplantation, esophagectomy, or lung cryobiopsy.[33][34][35] ## Treatment / Management The management of pneumothorax is guided by its etiology, clinical presentation, and risk stratification.[14][28] The key treatment principles include eliminating air from the pleural space, reducing air leakage, promoting pleural healing, facilitating lung reexpansion, and preventing recurrence.[36] **Asymptomatic Patients** Asymptomatic Patients with an incidentally discovered pneumothorax may not require intervention unless they are at high risk of recurrence. Typically, this decision is not made in the emergency department; instead, these patients should be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and care. **Symptomatic Patients** For symptomatic patients with stable vital signs, initial management may include needle aspiration or small-bore catheter insertion (pigtail catheter) in the emergency department. Evidence suggests that needle aspiration is as safe
