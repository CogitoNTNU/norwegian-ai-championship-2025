in confirming the diagnosis. **Laboratory and Pulmonary Function Testing** PFTs should be performed to assess for restrictive lung disease, which is characterized by decreased lung volumes (particularly decreased FVC, total lung capacity, and functional residual capacity) and decreased diffusion capacity. Other potential causes of restrictive ventilatory defects include chest wall abnormalities (eg, kyphoscoliosis), obesity (usually resulting in an isolated reduction in expiratory reserve volume (ERV)), or neuromuscular conditions (presenting with reduced TLC and VC but preserved RV).[34] When IPF is suspected, laboratory tests should be performed to exclude autoimmune disease. Commonly indicated tests include antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors. However, if autoimmune disease is highly suspected, additional tests such as antisynthetase antibodies, aldolase, Sj√∂gren, and scleroderma antibodies should also be considered (see **Image.** Diagnostic Algorithm for Evaluating Suspected IPF).[5][35][36] Individuals diagnosed with short telomere syndrome should be screened for bone marrow and liver dysfunction, and at-risk family members may necessitate telomere length analysis for screening purposes.[37] **Imaging Techniques** Although chest imaging is essential for diagnosis, chest x-rays lack the details necessary to confirm IPF. HRCT of the chest should be performed with axial cuts of 1.5 mm or less and acquired at 10 mm intervals for the diagnosis of ILD and IPF.[5] The characteristic feature of HRCT is a UIP pattern, which, on imaging, is characterized by bilateral subpleural basal predominant honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis or bronchiectasis (see **Image.** Radiological Characteristics of CT Patterns for Suspected UIP). Peripheral reticular opacities are usually most notable in the lower lobes. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation are atypical for a UIP pattern and, when present on imaging, should lead to suspicion for conditions other than IPF (see **Image.** CT Patterns of Probable UIP). Given the high incidence of CAD in IPF, a coronary artery calcification score may also be warranted. Low-dose CT protocols have been developed for patients requiring repeated imaging, such as those with previously diagnosed ILD, or to assess the presence or progression of lung nodules. This requires imaging the lung at intervals thinner than 10 mm (usually 1-2 mm) to identify small nodules or structural changes while exposing the lung to the least amount of radiation.[38] The American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend considering surgical lung biopsy if the diagnosis of IPF cannot be confirmed through noninvasive methods, especially when clinical and radiological findings are incongruent with UIP, unless the patient is at high risk for complications.[39] Transbronchial biopsy is avoided due
