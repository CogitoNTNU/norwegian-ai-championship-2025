respiratory tract and resolve within a few days, it is more likely to be a mild upper respiratory infection. Conversely, if the symptoms persist for a week or longer and are accompanied by lower respiratory tract symptoms, this presentation indicates acute bronchitis. During a physical examination, lung auscultation may reveal the presence of wheezing. In some instances, the detection of rhonchi may improve or clear with coughing, suggesting that the airway secretions or obstruction causing the sound can be alleviated through coughing efforts. Pneumonia should be considered a potential diagnosis when detecting rales or egophony. Mild tachycardia may accompany these findings, indicating fever and dehydration secondary to the viral illness. It is important to note that similar signs of tachycardia can also be observed in bacterial infections. In general, the evaluation of the rest of the body systems typically falls within normal limits. ## Evaluation Acute bronchitis is typically diagnosed clinically, relying on a comprehensive assessment encompassing a medical history, pulmonary examination, and other pertinent physical findings. The evaluation of oxygen saturation, along with the assessment of pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate, serves as a pivotal indicator for gauging the severity of the condition. In cases where vital signs fall within normal ranges and no physical examination findings suggest pneumonia, further diagnostic investigations are generally unnecessary. However, an exception to this rule applies to older patients (>75 years) or individuals with neurocognitive impairment. In such instances, a more extensive workup should be considered part of the evaluation process. Chest x-ray (CXR) findings in cases of acute bronchitis are generally nonspecific and often appear normal. The CXR findings may occasionally reveal increased interstitial markings indicative of bronchial wall thickening. A CXR proves particularly valuable in distinguishing pneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are present. Evidence-based guidelines established by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR where specific criteria are met, including the following:[14] - Heart rate exceeding 100 bpm - Respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min - Oral body temperature surpassing 38 Â°C - Chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus Laboratory testing, including a complete blood count and chemistry panel, may be conducted as part of the diagnostic workup for fever. The white blood count might show a mild elevation in some cases of acute bronchitis. Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios
