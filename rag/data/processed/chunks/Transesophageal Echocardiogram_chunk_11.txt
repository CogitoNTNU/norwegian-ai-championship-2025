TEE.[32] Two studies involved using contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced TEE in the detection of cardiac thrombi found that contrast-enhanced imaging was able to better delineate thrombi and was able to further identify the presence of thrombi more frequently than non-contrast-enhanced imaging.[33][34] If non-contrast imaging is inconclusive, then the use of contrast-enhanced imaging may be warranted. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The decision to order an echocardiogram requires an interprofessional team approach. The assessment of fluid status is a physical exam finding that can be performed not only by physicians but also by the nursing staff, and this can be used to help aid in the decision to order an echocardiogram. Interprofessional communication is important when treating any patient, including those with a cardiac history, and it is vital for all staff to continuously assess a patient's fluid status and need for further imaging assessments. Adequate communication about the specific indication for echocardiography for each specific patient, will help ensure optimal views and help improve the clinical utility of this test. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20863&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20863) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/echocardiogram-heart-ultrasound/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20863) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20863/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20863) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK558940/figure/article-20863.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK558940/figure/article-20863.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Transesophageal Echocardiogram.
