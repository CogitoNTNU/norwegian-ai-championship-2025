â‰¥ 60 years have also been affected. It has been observed that females are affected more than males amongst adults, whereas boys are more frequently affected than girls in the pediatric population.[11][14] Due to the lack of a clear definition of NORSE previously, it is possible that some of the cases were not diagnosed as NORSE. Hence, an accurate incidence of NORSE cannot be estimated reliably. However, it is estimated that NORSE represents approximately 20% of cases of RSE.[15] Both NORSE and FIRES can occur in any age group with no ethnic or racial predilection.[14] ## Pathophysiology An immune-mediated inflammatory process has been postulated as the underlying pathophysiology in FIRES.[16] In a study by Sakuma et al., the authors observed a marked overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with FIRES, compared to CSF specimens from patients with other inflammatory neurological conditions.[17] The upregulation of these inflammatory mediators could be secondary to activation of T cells, glial cells, and cells of the blood-brain barrier and perhaps have a role in epileptogenesis.[18] However, additional mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction or synaptic plasticity may also play a key role in seizure propagation.[15] Recently, a personal predisposition towards developing FIRES or NORSE has been hypothesized based on allelic variations in human leukocyte antigen subtypes and IL1 pathway.[19][20] The fact that FIRES is a subtype of NORSE, a similar autoimmune inflammatory mechanism has been considered as the most likely mechanism in patients with NORSE. Further research studies are required to understand the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism in patients with NORSE and FIRES. ## History and Physical NORSE and its subtype FIRES can develop in previously healthy adults or children and share some common clinical characteristics. Approximately 60% of patients with NORSE experience a prodromal illness, typically 1 to 14 days before the onset of seizure or SE.[11] Prodromal symptoms may include confusion, fatigue, headache, mild febrile illness, behavioral changes, mild gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, and memory complaints.[11][21][22] Fever is absent in up to 1/3 cases of NORSE, but, by definition, it is universally present in FIRES.[11] There is complete cessation of fever in approximately 50% of patients before the first seizure episode.[14] At the onset, seizures are usually brief and isolated with a propensity to gradually increase in number within a few hours to days and eventually evolve into SE. The number of seizures can be up
