level of consciousness, respiratory abnormalities, change in pupillary size, posturing, and death. Early recognition and diagnosis of intracranial hypertension due to cerebral edema are essential in caring for acute stroke patients to improve outcomes. Obtain neurosurgical consultation early. A ventriculostomy is indicated in the setting of obstructive hydrocephalus after cerebellar infarct. A decompressive suboccipital craniectomy is highly recommended in cerebellar edema with mass effect cases.[60][61] - **Seizures:** Post-stroke seizures occur in about 10% of patients, mainly hemorrhagic strokes or cortical infarcts. If the patient experiences a seizure within the first 2 weeks, antiepileptic drugs are indicated for a short period, generally 1 month. Long-term anticonvulsant therapy will be indicated if the seizure occurs later, for weeks or months after a stroke. However, the routine prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs is not recommended as per the newer AHA guidelines on the management of Hemorrhagic stroke as well as the ENLS guidelines.[62][63] - **Cardiac evaluation:** Cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias is recommended in the first 24 hours. The benefit of further monitoring after that is unclear. An initial troponin is recommended because there is an association between stroke and coronary artery disease. - **Antiplatelet treatment:** Aspirin is recommended within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset. A Cochrane review concluded that aspirin given within 48 hours of symptom onset for ischemic strokes prevented the recurrence of ischemic strokes and improved long-term outcomes. In addition, there was no significant risk of early intracranial hemorrhage with aspirin.[64] - **Antithrombotic treatment:** Full-dose anticoagulation is not recommended in acute stroke. The main exception is low-dose anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the guidelines state it is reasonable to initiate oral anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after neurological symptoms onset. When to start anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation after acute stroke is always a dilemma; initiation usually depends on factors like stroke size and other comorbidities. Usually, if the stroke size is small to moderate, anticoagulation is started in 7 to 14 days.[65] Sometimes, there are patients with small hemorrhagic transformation after acute stroke, and in this scenario, delay of anticoagulation is warranted. Delay of anticoagulation after hemorrhagic transformation is not associated with excessive stroke recurrence.[66] - **Statins:** High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily) are recommended for patients younger than 75 years with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, patients may be continued on
