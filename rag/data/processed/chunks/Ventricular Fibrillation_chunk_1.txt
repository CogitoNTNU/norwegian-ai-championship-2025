on an angiogram, anterior wall infarction, atrial fibrillation, and pre-infarction angina are more prone to develop VF.[3] Many common conditions associated with VF include electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia), acidosis, hypothermia, hypoxia, cardiomyopathies, family history of sudden cardiac death, congenital QT abnormalities, Brugada syndrome, and alcohol use. Patients with a history of VA especially sustained monomorphic or polymorphic VT may transition to VF in susceptible patients.[4] Genetic predisposition to VF is now increasingly recognized. The first genome-wide association was reported in the AGNES study identifying susceptibility locus for VF at 21q21.[5] ## Epidemiology In 2017 the American Heart Association (AHA) update estimated the total annual burden of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) at 356,500. At least 23% of OHCA treated by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) have VF/VT as the initial rhythm. With more than 60% of cardiovascular deaths resulting from cardiac arrest, it remains the leading cause of death worldwide.[6] Modern advances in assistive devices such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) have had a significant impact on these numbers. Many studies have identified VF as the most common underlying arrhythmia in patients with SCD. Among patients hospitalized with acute MI, 5% to 10% have VF or VT, and another 5% will have VF or VT within 48 hours of admission.[7] The true incidence of VF is underestimated, as individuals who suffer OHCA are not covered in most of these studies. Based on Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) data, survival to hospital discharge for VF patients was 31.4%. ## Pathophysiology VF occurs when parts of ventricular myocardium depolarize erratically in an uncoordinated manner. VF results from the following: \*\*_Abnormal Impulse Formation_ \*\* - _Increased automaticity:_ Purkinje cells around ischemic areas during MI can initiate ventricular tachycardia. - _Triggered activity:_ Early and late after depolarization can overcome refractory threshold and generate triggered potential causing extrasystoles. \*\*_Impulse Conduction_ \*\* - Functional and anatomical reentry circuits help sustain ventricular arrhythmia. ## History and Physical The most common presentation for VF is sudden collapse from cardiac arrest leading to SCD. This results from improper ventricular contraction resulting in low cardiac output. Patients may demonstrate signs of acute MI such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting before the event. Patients with a known history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure may show a worsening of chronic symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pedal edema. At the time of presentation,
