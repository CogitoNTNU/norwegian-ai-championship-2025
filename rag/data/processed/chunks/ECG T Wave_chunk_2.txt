major deflection of the QRS. Diffuse T wave inversions on an ECG can be associated with pericarditis. The changes on an ECG for pericarditis occur over 2-3 weeks, initially with ST-elevation, then T wave inversion, with eventual resolution of the ST segment.[7] Massive pulmonary embolism can cause right ventricular strain, manifesting as the classic S1Q3T3 (deep S wave in the lead I, Q wave, and T wave inversion in the lead III). ## Epidemiology Approximately 15.5 million Americans over the age of 20 have coronary heart disease, according to the 2016 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics update from the American Heart Association (AHA). It is estimated that a myocardial infarction occurs about every 42 seconds in the United States.[8] A study was done by Sanchis-Gomar et al. to evaluate the prevalence of hyperkalemia, a common cause of T-wave changes in the general population. The study included approximately 2.2 million patients to find the prevalence of hyperkalemia. Sachis-Gomar et al. deduced that approximately 1.55% or 3.7 million Americans have hyperkalemia. The rates were elevated in those with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension. About 6% of patients with chronic kidney disease and heart failure were found to have hyperkalemia.[9] ## Pathophysiology **Normal T-wave Physiology** Normal T waves are upright in leads I, II, and V3-V6 and inverted in AVR. They are less than 5 mm in limb leads, less than 10 mm in precordial leads, and variable presentations in III, AVL, AVF, and V1-V2.[2] This graphical depiction of ECG is associated with lead placement and the heart's electrical pathways. **Abnormal T-wave Pathophysiology** T wave changes are secondary to electrolyte abnormalities in the myocardium since the ECG is representative of the heart's electricity. The outflow of potassium from the myocyte during repolarization is necessary to restore resting membrane potential. In disease states such as ischemia, the Na/K-ATPase cannot function to restore this gradient; when there is hyperkalemia, the electrochemical gradient for potassium to flow out of the cell is skewed, altering the repolarization phase. Abnormalities in the T wave on an ECG reflect these changes during phase 3 of the action potential. ## Histopathology Ventricular repolarization is depicted on the ECG in the form of a T-wave. Ventricular depolarization (phase zero) is the opening of Na channels; phase 1 is when these Na channels begin to close, and K channels open. The opening of Ca channels sustains phase 2 of
