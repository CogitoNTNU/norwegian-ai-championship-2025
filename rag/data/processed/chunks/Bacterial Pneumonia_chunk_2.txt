in up to 19% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in individuals aged 5 or older.[8] In the United States, it has been reported as an attributable cause of community-acquired pneumonia in up to 32.5% of cases.[5] Despite its prevalence, isolation of _M. pneumoniae_ may represent colonization rather than infection, especially in those with mild disease or asymptomatic carriage.[17] An observational study conducted in the Netherlands involving 202 children found that isolated _M. pneumoniae was_ detected in 16.2% of children with suspected pneumonia. However, it was also found in 21% of asymptomatic children, suggesting a high seroprevalence in the population, consistent with other studies.[16][17] _M. pneumoniae_ infections tend to be more common with advancing age, especially among older individuals, where it ranks second only to \_S.\__pneumoniae_ in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases.[5] Symptoms may take 4 to 20 days to appear following exposure, which is spread via aerosols from human-to-human transmission. The infection can occur year-round but is most frequently observed in the summer and fall in the United States and Asia.[18][19][20] Outbreaks are common in small communities and enclosed spaces, such as schools and military barracks.[21] The organism is transmitted from person to person, and the infection typically spreads slowly. Epidemics may occur every few years, lasting for prolonged periods. This pattern may be related to its longer incubation period and its ability to remain in the respiratory tract of infected hosts for long periods.[20][22] _C. pneumoniae_ is also a common cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia, contributing to 6% to 20% of cases.[23][24] Infections tend to occur in the summer and fall in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in Australia, they are most frequently observed in the fall.[25][26] Transmission occurs through human-to-human contact but is inefficient, leading to most outbreaks being contained at the household level.[27] Immunocompromised hosts are more at risk of infection and severe disease. However, the incubation period is long (approximately 3-4 weeks), symptoms are typically mild, and some patients may experience asymptomatic infection.[28] Despite individuals aged 5 to 15 having a high rate of infection, _C. pneumoniae_ infection is common in older individuals and can result in higher mortality rates compared to younger populations.[27][29] The prevalence of _C. pneumoniae_ infection increases with age, and seroprevalence indicating exposure is found in 50% of adults by 20 years of age, and >95% by 50 years of age.[30] _L. pneumophila_ , unlike _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ , is not transmitted person-to-person, and infection
