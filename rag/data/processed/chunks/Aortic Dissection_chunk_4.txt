occurs in the extracellular matrix and increases the interlamellar or translamellar space, creating the so-called “cystic degeneration” of the media that decreases vessel resistance. The main component of mucin accumulation is chondroitin-6-sulfate.[12] - Alteration of elastic fibers - Under normal conditions, a dense meshwork of elastic fibers in the media maintains the aorta's structural integrity. These fibers provide elasticity and resistance to the constant pulsatile forces exerted by blood pressure. Alterations in these elastic fibers, such as fragmentation, thinning, and disorganization, compromise the aorta's ability to withstand these forces. - Fragmentation of elastic fibers increases the spaces between the lamellar layers (translamellar spaces), weakening the aorta's mechanical strength and elasticity. This renders the vessel more prone to dissection, as the weakened wall can't resist the high shear forces of blood flow very well. - Thinning these fibers further weakens the vessel wall, widening the spaces between elastic fibers and reducing the aorta's overall resilience. This makes the aorta susceptible to dilation, aneurysm formation, and dissection. - Disorganization refers to the loss of the parallel arrangement of elastic fibers, which are normally aligned in an orderly fashion to withstand pressure. When disorganized, the fibers are haphazardly arranged and unable to function effectively, leading to a loss of structural cohesion and increasing the risk of tears within the aortic wall. - Altered smooth muscle cells - Smooth muscle cells undergo nuclear loss and disorganization. - Nuclear cell loss, so-called “smooth muscle cell necrosis,” can appear in bands or as wide areas where only the ghost cell contours are visible. The disarray of smooth muscle cells can be focal or nodular. - Laminar medial collapse - The collapsing of elastic fibers represents “laminar medial necrosis” and is coupled with significant loss of interposed smooth muscle cells. - Collagen fibrosis - Collagen fibers can become fibrotic; this is the least common process in degenerative aortic disease. These findings are often combined and must be carefully recognized to accurately grade the degree of medial degeneration as mild, moderate, or severe. This grading is determined by evaluating the severity and distribution of the degenerative lesions observed within the aortic wall.[13][14] Each category reflects the extent of structural damage, including alterations in elastic fibers, smooth muscle cell integrity, and the extracellular matrix. Identifying these changes is crucial for understanding the underlying pathology and predicting potential outcomes, as more severe degeneration is associated with a higher risk of
