Various modalities may be used to relieve pain, and one of them is the administration of opiates. Opiates and opioids are strong pain relievers derived from the plant _Papaver somniferum_. Conventionally, the term "opiates" refers to natural compounds obtained from the poppy flower base, while "opioids" are synthetic agents with similar effects. Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years, and these drugs have been assumed to be relatively safe despite the potential consequences of overdosing, including central nervous system and respiratory depression resulting in arrest. However, many reports in the last 2 decades have raised concerns about the safety of these drugs. Opiate prescriptions have dramatically increased over this period, with the United States currently experiencing an opioid epidemic with fatal consequences. Overdose and toxicity cases are on the rise and are continually reported in all major cities. Empirical prescription habits by healthcare workers to relieve pain have also led to an epidemic of overdose outside the healthcare setting, with the eruption of clandestine laboratories manufacturing synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and distributing them on the street. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing opioid toxicity. Participants gain a deeper understanding of the condition's risk factors, etiology, toxicology, pathophysiology, presentations, and evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The course highlights the use of opioid reversal agents such as naloxone to reduce morbidity and mortality. Emphasis shall be given to the role of healthcare professionals in treating opioid use disorder through medication-assisted and nonpharmacologic approaches to support recovery and abstinence. Greater competence equips clinicians to collaborate effectively within an interprofessional team caring for affected individuals, improving outcomes. **Objectives:** - Apply toxicokinetic data when evaluating the progression of opioid overdose and toxicity. - Select the appropriate diagnostic tests to differentiate opioid overdose from conditions that can present with similar signs and symptoms. - Implement individualized combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for managing opioid toxicity. - Collaborate with the
