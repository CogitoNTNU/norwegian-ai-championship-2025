pulmonary complications, except theophylline, patients should continue their maintenance medications up to and including the day of surgery. Patients with poorly controlled symptoms undergoing a high-risk surgery should receive supplemental glucocorticoids in addition to a short-acting ÃŸ2-agonist 5 days before surgery when possible. In emergent cases, clinicians may administer preoperative short-acting bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. Clinicians and advanced practitioners use their clinical expertise to perform a preoperative clinical assessment to determine the patient's asthma severity and level of disease control. Based on current guidelines, they determine the appropriate asthma management to optimize patients for surgical anesthesia. In addition, anesthesia providers choose the most appropriate anesthetic techniques and agents to avoid excessive airway stimulation and bronchospasm. Nurses are vital in monitoring patients for symptoms of pulmonary complications and providing education about proper inhaler use and perioperative medication regimens. Nurses ensure the patient performs deep breathing exercises, uses the incentive spirometer, and ambulates as appropriate. Pharmacists provide guidance on the stress dosing of glucocorticoids and educate patients about the various asthma medications, including dosages, proper usage, and the importance of adherence. Respiratory therapists administer bronchodilator therapy and manage ventilator settings, ensuring optimal respiratory function throughout the procedure. By employing a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, appropriate diagnostic testing, medication management, and anesthetic techniques and choices, clinicians can minimize the anesthetic risk for patients with asthma. Interprofessional communication and care coordination are critical to patient safety, as all team members are responsible for monitoring the patient's respiratory status. Preoperative team meetings facilitate discussions among anesthesia providers, surgeons, nurses, and respiratory therapists, aligning airway management and emergency preparedness strategies. Real-time intraoperative monitoring allows teams to promptly identify and address bronchospasm or airway resistance signs, ensuring immediate intervention. By using their skills, promoting interprofessional communication, and coordinating care, clinicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, promote patient safety, and optimize team performance in anesthesia management in patients with asthma. ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions Clear and closed-loop professional communication should be maintained between interdisciplinary team members and among all team members. ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring Monitoring must be diligent and consistent between and among team members. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17923&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17923) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17923/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17923) ## References 1.
