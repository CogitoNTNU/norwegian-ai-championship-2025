activities may also be used, though this may not be practical. Forced hydration, particularly at large volumes, should be discouraged.[3][7] Salty foods may be consumed in conjunction with oral fluids as desired by the athlete to support osmotic balance during endurance events. Supplementing the serum sodium with salt tablets or packets at any particular rate or total dose during activity has not been shown to decrease rates of EAH.[3][9] Athletes participating in organized endurance events should be educated on the risks of overhydration, the importance of concurrent food intake, and the signs and symptoms of EAH and other heat injuries. Event staff, EMS and frontline healthcare providers, and military members should also be educated on recognizing EAH in the field and prevention measures via avoiding overhydration and adequate oral intake.[3][7] ## Pearls and Other Issues The Defence Health Agency released a Practice Recommendation on the management of EAH in December 2020 to improve military-wide awareness of EAH and care for service members who develop it. _The views expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy of the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government._ ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Prompt recognition of EAH over other exertional injuries is imperative. Patients with confirmed or suspected EAH should be transferred to a tertiary care center for advanced care. EAH diagnoses must be clearly communicated at transfers of care to ensure appropriate fluid management. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=133173&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=133173) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/hormones-and-body-chemistry/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=133173) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/133173/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=133173) ## References 1.
