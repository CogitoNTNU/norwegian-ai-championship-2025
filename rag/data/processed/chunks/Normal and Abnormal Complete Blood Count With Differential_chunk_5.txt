disease, lymphoproliferative disease, endocrinopathy, viral infection, tuberculosis, chronic inflammatory disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis), allergy, anaphylaxis or drug-induced. Isolated basophilia is extremely uncommon and warrants workup to exclude a myeloproliferative process. Basopenia, a decrease in the basophil count, may be due to acute infection, hyperthyroidism, ovulation, or medications.[16][17] **Platelet Tests** **Platelet count** The platelet count is the amount of platelets per unit volume of blood and is expressed in cells per microliter of blood or cubic millimeter. The normal reference interval in adults is 150,000 to 400,000/μL or mm3. Platelet counts may appear low due to platelet clumping in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in blood specimen collection tubes, causing pseudo thrombocytopenia. Repeating the platelet count is recommended when a specimen is collected in a tube containing a different anticoagulant, such as citrate or oxalate.[15] Thrombocytopenia, a decrease in the platelet count, can be due to decreased production, increased splenic sequestration, or increased peripheral utilization and is defined by a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL or mm3.[18] However, major bleeding is unusual unless the platelet count decreases below 50,000/μL or mm3. The risk of spontaneous major bleeding increases exponentially below 20,000/μL or mm3, and a dramatic increase in the risk of spontaneous cerebral bleeding is seen at counts below 10,000/μL or mm3. Thrombocytosis, an increase in the platelet count, is defined as a platelet count above 450,000/μL or mm3, however, is rarely symptomatic unless the platelet count is above 1,000,000/μL or mm3. This may be due to primary myeloproliferative disorders, secondary to bone marrow stimulation, or decreased sequestration post-splenectomy.[19][20] The platelet count may be spuriously elevated in bacteremia, fungemia, or malaria, where the analyzer counts microorganisms in the blood as platelets. This may also occur in the presence of red blood cell fragments, such as in hemolysis.[4][21] Other platelet tests include mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT); however, these are not typically reported with the standard CBC. **Conclusion** The components of the CBC can help identify a wide range of pathologies and remain one of the most commonly ordered and useful tests in clinical medicine. While automated analyzers have allowed for fast and accurate results, spurious results may arise in several situations (see **Table.** 3). Differentiating between true changes and spurious abnormalities can impact clinical decision-making and patient care. Results must be interpreted in the clinical context and according
