ALP should be measured at 3 to 6 months to assess patients' response to calcitonin therapy. When serum ALP levels have returned to normal, they can be evaluated every 6 months to a year. If ALP levels start to increase again, the possibility of calcitonin antibody formation should be considered; therefore, an antibody titer test may be warranted. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are also recommended for patients, followed by periodic monitoring of their serum levels. If the patient continues to experience bone pain despite calcitonin therapy, obtaining a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can provide more precise insight into the lesion and aid in deciding whether surgical intervention should be considered. **Hypercalcemia** Calcitonin is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of hypercalcemic emergencies. The complications associated with hypercalcemia include confusion, coma, dehydration, polyuria, kidney stones, nausea, constipation, pancreatitis, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Calcitonin addresses these concerns by decreasing the resorption of hydroxyapatite from bone and enhancing the renal excretion of calcium. Owing to the drug's swift onset of action, calcitonin is a viable treatment option when a prompt reduction in calcium levels is required. The initial reduction in calcium levels is achieved through rehydration using a saline solution, followed by the simultaneous administration of bisphosphonate and calcitonin. Calcitonin is administered through IM or SQ injection at a dosage of 4 units per kg, repeated every 12 hours.[14] Calcitonin's effects become noticeable within approximately 2 hours, and it can reduce serum calcium levels by up to 1 to 2 mg/dL within 4 to 6 hours.[15] If the response is inadequate after 12 hours, the dosage can be increased to 8 units per kg. If the initial response proves inadequate after 48 hours, the administration of calcitonin can be increased to every 6 hours. After 24 to 48 hours, the effects of calcitonin become less effective as osteoclasts partially adapt to its action, reducing the drug's calcium-lowering efficacy.[16][17][18] The countermeasure to counteract this adaptation mechanism involves simultaneously administering a bisphosphonate. As bisphosphonates attain effective concentrations within 48 hours, their efficacy increases while calcitonin's effectiveness declines. Calcitonin can also combine with other calcium-lowering drugs, including loop diuretics, oral phosphate, and corticosteroids. **Off-Label Uses** - Migraine headaches: Research indicated that intranasal or SQ administration of calcitonin may provide relief from migraine pain, potentially by inhibiting the release of neuropeptides involved in migraine pathogenesis. However, the available evidence supporting its
