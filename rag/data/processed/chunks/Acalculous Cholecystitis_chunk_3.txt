they do not treat the increased intraluminal pressure and subsequent ischemia. Eventual gallbladder perforation will lead to bile peritonitis and contribute to the body's systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. ## History and Physical Acute acalculous cholecystitis may present similarly to calculous cholecystitis. Patients typically present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain that worsens with fatty foods, physical exam findings of right upper quadrant tenderness, and a positive Murphy's sign (ie, inspiratory arrest from pain during palpation of the right upper quadrant). Fever, chills, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and food intolerance may also be present. These patients are often already admitted to the ICU for another severe illness or are recovering from extensive surgery. Critically ill patients unable to participate in the physical exam may have fevers of unknown origin or grimacing during abdominal palpation, which should prompt additional testing. ## Evaluation **Laboratory Studies** Preliminary laboratory studies typically include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and lipase levels. Findings of leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin, are common. **Ultrasound Imaging** Ultrasound is usually the initial image obtained, as this can be completed at the bedside in a timely fashion and is cost-effective. Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm, gallbladder wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid are indicative of cholecystitis (see **Image**. Acalculous Cholecystitis). **Additional Diagnostic Studies** The test of choice for diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of a normal ultrasound is a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, which may be done in conjunction with administration of CCK.[16] A HIDA scan evaluates the function or ejection fraction of the gallbladder. After the radionuclide is administered, CCK is given to stimulate gallbladder emptying. A calculated ejection fraction of â‰¤35% may be indicative of hypokinetic functioning of the gallbladder.[17] HIDA scan may also demonstrate no filling of the gallbladder with radiotracer material, indicative of cystic duct obstruction and acute cholecystitis.[6][18] Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen with intravenous contrast may also reveal gallbladder wall thickening, edema, and pericholecystic fluid in the absence of gallstones and sludge. ## Treatment / Management **Stabalization and Antibiotic Therapy** Patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis should receive appropriate fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics that provide coverage for gram-negative rods and anaerobes, ideally after blood cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics alone are usually ineffective as they inadequately penetrate the pressurized gallbladder.[5][19][20] Individuals requiring ICU-level care should be properly stabilized before
