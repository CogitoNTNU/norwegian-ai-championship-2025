amino acid sequences that differ from the skeletal isoforms and are encoded by unique genes.[25] Human cTnI has an additional 31 amino-acid residue on the amino-terminal end compared with skeletal muscle TnI, giving it complete cardiac specificity.[26] Only one isoform of cTnI has been identified. cTnI is not expressed in healthy, regenerating, or diseased human or animal skeletal muscle.[27] cTnT is encoded by a different gene than the one that encodes for skeletal muscle isoforms. An 11-amino acid amino-terminal residue gives this marker unique cardiac specificity.[24] In humans, cTnT isoform expression has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle specimens obtained from patients with muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and end-stage renal disease.[28] Thus care is necessary to choose antibody pairs for the cTnT assay that do not detect these expressed isoforms or the immunoreactive proteins expressed in neuromuscular skeletal diseases that show cross-reactivity to the commercial cTnT assays because false-positive, noncardiac, cTnT results can occur.[29] ## Specimen Requirements and Procedure Serum or heparinized plasma may be the sample type for most commercially available assays; whole blood is used for some point-of-care methods.[30] However, several studies report significant differences in cTnI measured in serum and plasma, with plasma results reportedly being up to approximately 30% lower compared with serum.[31] Care should be taken when preparing specimens for testing from patients who have received anticoagulant therapy. These specimens may require additional time to clot. This tendency for lower results in plasma can fail to detect an early or small acute myocardial infarction.[32] The binding of heparin to cTnI may reduce immunoreactivity, depending on the heparin concentration in sample collection tubes (e.g., heparin at a concentration of 90 U/mL is reported to cause a decrease of approximately 20% in cTnI concentration).[33] The effect of heparin on cTnI immunoassays may be induced by changes within the sample matrix. In contrast, the apparent decrease reported in cTnT values by adding heparin results from the interaction between negatively charged glycosaminoglycan and basic amino acid residues on the cTnT molecule.[34] The type of specimen (serum or plasma) should remain consistent for a given patient.[35] Results may be confounded if there is poor preanalytical handling of troponin specimens, such as incomplete sample mixing at the time of specimen collection, insufficient sample centrifugation and separation of red cells from serum or plasma, presence of fibrin due to incomplete serum separation, and so forth.[36] Currently, the consensus is that the turnaround time
