adverse pathways that are over-activated in the setting of heart failure, for example, RAAS, which has anti-diuretic effects, and the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, which increases cardiac remodeling and fibrosis.[21] Expression of the BNP gene is a feature of both atrial and ventricular myocytes. In the normal heart, the main site of BNP expression is in the atrial regions. Ventricular BNP gene expression increases drastically in cardiac diseases affecting the ventricles, such as heart failure (HF).[22] Observing ventricular BNP gene expression in ventricular disease may have given rise to the common statement that BNP is predominantly a ventricular hormone. However, atrial and ventricular myocytes differ considerably concerning their endocrine phenotypes, and it is reasonable to expect significant differences in peptide storage and secretion patterns.[23] Atrial granules contain both intact precursors and biosynthetic end products, that is, bioactive ANP-28 and BNP-32. In contrast, normal ventricular myocytes do not seem to express such granules, and normal ventricular myocytes do not contain proBNP-derived peptides.[24] The estimated half-life of BNP is about 20 minutes, whereas NT-proBNP has a half-life of 120 min; this difference explains why NT-proBNP serum levels are approximately six times higher than BNP levels, even though both molecules are released in equimolar proportions.[25] Like BNP, NT-proBNP concentrations vary by age; the normal threshold for those under 50 years of age is 450 pg/mL, while it is 900 pg/mL for those greater than 50 years of age.[26] The clinical importance of measuring one peptide over the other has not yet been demonstrated. BNP production in cardiomyocytes is significantly increased by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta, an effect that is markedly increased when fibroblasts are present; inflammatory cytokines directly stimulate BNP production in the heart independent of hemodynamics.[27] This phenomenon is not seen with ANP. In clinical practice, plasma BNP levels will be higher in patients with myocarditis than expected solely from the hemodynamics.[28] ## Specimen Requirements and Procedure The b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is labile and must be collected into tubes containing EDTA and tested ideally within four hours of collection. Serum samples and citrated or heparinized plasma cannot be used. BNP can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2^oC to 8^oC for some assays.[29] BNP is degraded by contact activation of the blood coagulation system and can be stabilized by storage under frozen conditions or by adding kallikrein protease inhibitors.[30] In contrast, NT-proBNP is much more stable than BNP
