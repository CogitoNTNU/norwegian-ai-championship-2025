various leads and wave morphologies: for atrial abnormality (enlargement or hypertrophy), leads II and V1 are usually assessed. Right atrial hypertrophy increases the amplitude in the first half of the P waves by 2.5 mm in inferior leads and a possible right axis deviation.[30] It is often termed P pulmonale because of its frequent association with chronic obstructive lung disease. Left atrial hypertrophy shows an increase in the amplitude of the terminal component and duration of the P wave. It must descend at least 1 mm below the isoelectric line in lead V1 and be at least 0.04 seconds (40 ms) in width. As the left atrium is electrically dominant, it shows no axis deviation.[31] The diagnosis of ventricular hypertrophy requires looking at several leads on the ECG. The right ventricular hypertrophy characteristically shows by right axis deviation along with the presence of a more significant R wave than the S wave in lead V1, whereas in lead V6, a more significant S wave than the R wave.[32] Left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by voltage criteria either by calculating the voltage of the R wave in V5 or V6 plus the S wave in V1 or V2 exceeding 35 mm or by the voltage of the R wave exceeding 13 mm in lead aVL. Infrequently, there is also the presence of secondary repolarization abnormalities, including asymmetric T wave inversion and downsloping ST-segment depression, commonly also referred to as the strain pattern; the left axis deviation often accompanies this.[33] **P-wave** It represents atrial depolarization on the ECG. As atrial depolarization initiates by the SA node located in the right atrium, the right atrium gets depolarized first, followed by left atrial depolarization. So the first half of the P wave represents right atrial depolarization and the second half shows left atrial depolarization. Its duration is three small squares wide and 2.5 small squares high. It is always positive in the lead I and II and consistently negative in lead aVR in normal sinus rhythm. It is commonly biphasic in lead V1. An abnormal P wave may indicate atrial enlargement.[34] **PR Interval** It represents the time from the beginning of atrial depolarization to the start of ventricular depolarization and includes the delay at the AV node. The average interval is 3 to 5 small squares (120 to 200 ms).[35] Variations in the PR interval can lead to various disorders. Long PR interval may
