non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and decreased ejection fraction. Another mechanism by which anginal symptoms can be treated is vascular smooth muscle relaxation. This leads to coronary artery dilatation, thereby increasing perfusion ability. The drugs that work on this mechanism are dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and nicorandil.[1] Another drug used for chronic stable angina is ranolazine\*\*,\*\* which inhibits the late sodium current in ventricular myocardial cells. This reduces diastolic contractile dysfunction.[8] Treatment for unstable angina is aimed at pain reduction, limiting damage to the myocardium, and decreasing morbidity and mortality. **Nitrates** - no mortality benefit, but used for chest pain relief. They cause vasodilation, which decreases preload and left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. They are contraindicated in cases of hypotension and previous use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors within the past 48 hours.[9] **Morphine** - no mortality benefit, used for pain relief when pain relief is not fully achieved by nitrates. It causes some vasodilation aside from analgesia. **Beta-blockers** - reduce mortality. They cause a decrease in heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand.[9] **Antiplatelet agents** - dual therapy with aspirin and either clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromesâ€” acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and stroke.[9][10] **Anticoagulants** - reduce mortality by decreasing re-infarction rates in combination with antiplatelet agents. Used intravenously for acute treatment.[9] **Anatomic assessment of coronary arteries/consideration of revascularization** - high-risk patients should be identified with risk stratification methods and considered for urgent revascularization.[9] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of angina can divide into body systems: - Gastrointestinal: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, peptic ulcer disease - Pulmonary: pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism - Musculoskeletal: costochondritis, rib injury, muscle spasm, chest wall injury - Psychiatric: panic attack, generalized anxiety - Cardiac non-ischemic: pericarditis, myocarditis - Vascular: aortic dissection ## Prognosis The prognosis of chronic stable angina progression to cardiac events varies among patients. Factors affecting prognosis include cardiovascular comorbidities as well as compliance with lifestyle modifications and medical treatment plans. Long-term prognosis is also affected by left ventricular systolic function, the degree of exercise the patient can tolerate, and the extent of CAD present.[1] Risk factors for poorer prognosis are diabetes mellitus, previous MI, hypertension, increasing age, and male sex.[11] The use of nitrates has also been demonstrated to be a
