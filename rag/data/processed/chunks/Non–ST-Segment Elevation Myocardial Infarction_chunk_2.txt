In the past decades, several studies have shown a declining incidence of MI in the United States.[12] ## Pathophysiology The acute occlusion of one or multiple large epicardial coronary arteries for more than 20 to 40 minutes can lead to acute myocardial infarction. The occlusion is usually thrombotic and due to the rupture of a plaque formed in the coronary arteries. The occlusion leads to a lack of oxygen in the myocardium, which results in sarcolemmal disruption and myofibril relaxation.[2] These changes are one of the first ultrastructural changes in the process of MI, which are followed by mitochondrial alterations. The prolonged ischemia ultimately results in liquefactive necrosis of myocardial tissue. The necrosis spreads from sub-endocardium to sub-epicardium. The subepicardium is believed to have increased collateral circulation, which delays its death.[2] Depending on the territory affected by the infarction, the cardiac function is compromised. Due to the negligible regeneration capacity of the myocardium, the infarcted area heals by scar formation, and often, the heart is remodeled characterized by dilation, segmental hypertrophy of remaining viable tissue, and cardiac dysfunction.[13] ## History and Physical The imbalance between oxygen supply and the demand leads to myocardial ischemia and can sometimes lead to myocardial infarction. The patientâ€™s history, electrocardiographic findings, and elevated serum biomarkers help identify ischemic symptoms. Myocardial ischemia can present as chest pain, upper extremity pain, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort that occurs during exertion or at rest. Myocardial ischemia can also present as dyspnea or fatigue, which are known to be ischemic equivalents.[14] The chest pain is usually retrosternal and is sometimes described as the sensation of pressure or heaviness. The pain often radiates to the left shoulder, neck, or arms with no obvious precipitating factors, and it may be intermittent or persistent. The pain usually lasts for
