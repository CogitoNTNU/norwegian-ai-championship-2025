It is one of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy and is a relatively rare but serious complication that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. This activity describes the pathophysiology of placental abruption and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients. **Objectives:** - Determine the etiology of placental abruption. - Identify the pathophysiology of placental abruption. - Apply the presentation of a patient with placental abruption. - Communicate strategies for the interprofessional care team to employ for optimal management of patients with placental abruption.

It is 1 of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. Placental abruption is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that puts the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. It is also called abruptio placenta (See **Image.** Placental Abruption).[1][2] ## Etiology The exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption. Placental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the
