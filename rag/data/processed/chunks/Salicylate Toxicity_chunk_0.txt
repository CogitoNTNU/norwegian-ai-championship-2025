The entactogenic properties foster euphoria, memory retrieval, and enhanced sensory perception. This course sheds light on clinical aspects of MDMA use, emphasizing its potential life-threatening impact on cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hepatic systems. Participants will gain the skills to assess, manage, and recognize adverse effects to intervene promptly. Beyond individual competencies, the course underscores the significance of an interprofessional care approach. A dynamic blend of case studies, expert insights, and practical scenarios equips learners to navigate MDMA-related emergencies with precision. The course highlights the pivotal role of addressing MDMA-induced morbidity, emphasizing effective communication and shared decision-making. By bridging the practice gap collectively, clinicians and allied healthcare professionals will be empowered to deliver optimal care, improving patient outcomes in instances of MDMA-related emergencies. **Objectives:** - Identify the acute symptoms and signs of MDMA toxicity, especially in emergency settings. - Apply current, evidence-based treatments for patients with MDMA toxicity. - Implement the appropriate diagnostic tests for a patient with MDMA toxicity. - Collaborate with interprofessional team members, including medical toxicologists, pharmacists, and poison control centers, to provide efficient, comprehensive, and coordinated care for the MDMA toxic patient.

The entactogenic properties foster euphoria, memory retrieval, and enhanced sensory perception. The synthetic derivative of amphetamine was first developed in 1912, leading to public introduction in the 1960s and recreational drug use in the 1980s. MDMA is widely considered part of the psychoactive group of substances called entactogens (Greek roots meaning "touching within"). As an entactogen, MDMA promotes euphoria, retrieval of repressed memories, feelings of closeness, empathy, sexuality, and communication.
