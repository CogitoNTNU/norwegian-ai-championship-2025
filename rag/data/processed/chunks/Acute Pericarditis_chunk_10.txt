according to small studies. Therefore, while strong evidence is lacking, stopping anticoagulation when feasible in these patients may be prudent.[46] However, no formal guidelines exist, and recommendations are based solely on expert opinion. Additionally, concomitant use of ASA should be avoided unless there is a strong indication, such as recent stent placement or post-acute coronary syndrome. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses include: - Pleurisy - Pneumonia - Acute myocardial infarction - Bony pain - Costochondritis - Angina ## Prognosis The overall prognosis for acute pericarditis is excellent, with most patients experiencing complete recovery. Up to 30% of patients who are not treated with colchicine may experience recurrent pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is exceedingly rare following idiopathic acute pericarditis, occurring in less than 1% of cases. However, the risk of constrictive pericarditis increases with specific etiologies, particularly purulent bacterial or tuberculosis pericarditis, where it may rise to as high as 30%.[56][57] Cardiac tamponade, the most feared acute complication, rarely occurs after idiopathic pericarditis but is more commonly associated with malignancy and infectious causes of pericarditis.[58] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Diagnosing and managing pericarditis can be complex and is best accomplished through an interprofessional healthcare team that includes a cardiologist, radiologist, cardiac surgeon, infectious disease specialist, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner. Most patients present with vague chest pain, which can be mistaken for a heart attack, pleurisy, or angina. Therefore, consulting with a cardiologist before initiating treatment is essential. In most cases, conservative treatment with NSAIDs effectively resolves pericarditis; however, an echocardiogram is typically performed to rule out pericardial fluid and/or tamponade. If drainage of the pericardial fluid is necessary, the patient should be kept NPO and educated about the available treatment options. Patients with uremic pericarditis require close follow-up, as recurrence of pericardial fluid and signs of pericarditis are common. Additionally, patients should be advised to limit strenuous activity, as this may increase the risk of hypotension and arrhythmias. Pharmacists should educate patients about medication compliance. If colchicine is used as a preventive measure, the patient should be informed about potential adverse effects and the importance of follow-up appointments. A cardiology nurse should monitor these patients until all symptoms have resolved. Throughout the process, interprofessional healthcare team members should maintain open communication to ensure improved patient outcomes. While the prognosis for most patients is favorable, recovery can often take weeks or even months. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple
