edema from airway swelling may make laryngoscopy difficult. When faced with a suspected difficult airway due to thermal injury to supraglottic structures, the most widely accepted and safe approach is to use fiberoptic intubation. This technique involves the application of topical anesthetic and minimal general anesthetics. If fiberoptic intubation is chosen, ketamine-induced sedation/anesthesia can create ideal intubation conditions due to the maintenance of pharyngeal muscle tone. Ketamine is associated with preserving hemodynamic stability, hypercapnia responses, and decreased airway resistance, making it an ideal agent for individuals with supraglottic swelling. Utilizing anesthetic agents that disrupt airway tones, such as propofol and paralytic agents, may further obstruct the airway creating much more difficult intubating conditions.[1][3] **Intravascular Access** Individuals who have suffered severe burns may face challenges when receiving intravenous treatment due to the damage caused to common access areas such as the neck, limbs, and groin. Additionally, edema resulting from the burn shock phase or fluid creep from the overcompensation of fluid infusion to address intravascular loss can further complicate the process. Delay of fluid resuscitation for more than 2 hours after the initial injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, making vascular access an essential and critical component of burn management. When intravascular access proves too difficult via conventional means, peripheral intravenous or central venous access, intraosseous access can be overly beneficial. Intraosseous access is typically faster than peripheral intravenous and central venous line placement, with a much higher chance of first-time attempt success. The caveat of intraosseous access is that it is more likely to cause insertion and infusion pain than conventional methods. Despite its faster and easier placement, it is still not as common an access tool as one would surmise. To prevent intraosseous access failure, it is crucial to familiarize the device beforehand, as improper placement is the most common cause of failure. The proximal tibia is the most common location for placing an intraosseous needle, but the proximal humerus is equally effective. The proximal tibia is advantageous as it does not interfere with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.[2][9][10] **Thermoregulation** Patients suffering from severe burns lose their principal barrier to preventing heat loss. Thus, hypothermia becomes a primary anesthetic consideration. Evaporative heat and water loss from burn wounds create a direct means of heat loss. The cerebral mechanisms that combat hypothermia become dysregulated in severe burns. The critical temperature is the temperature at which a physiologic response to hypothermia
