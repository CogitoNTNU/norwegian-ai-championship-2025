rare. Some women may experience lasting cognitive impairments, particularly after recurrent seizures or untreated severe hypertension.[2] There is uncertainty whether the pathophysiology of antepartum eclampsia differs from that of postpartum eclampsia. In either case, the condition often presents with symptoms like severe headaches, visual disturbances, and altered mental statusâ€”but it can also occur suddenly and without warning.[1] Magnesium sulfate is considered the first-line treatment for preventing and controlling seizures in patients with eclampsia, although its use in patients who are pregnant with preeclampsia without severe features is debated. Management involves supportive measures, careful monitoring of magnesium levels to avoid toxicity, especially in women with impaired renal function, and timely fetal delivery.[3] Additionally, the choice of anesthesia during delivery is crucial, with regional anesthesia generally preferred over general anesthesia due to the lower risk of complications.[2] ## Etiology Eclampsia, a severe complication of preeclampsia, has multiple underlying causes, with uteroplacental ischemia being the primary mechanism. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Preeclampsia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27640)," for more information on preeclampsia. Uteroplacental ischemia involves an inadequate blood supply to the placenta, leading to its infarction and the release of toxic substances into the maternal bloodstream. These substances may trigger seizures, the hallmark of eclampsia. The role of uteroplacental ischemia is supported by various animal models that replicate preeclampsia-like symptoms, including hypertension and proteinuria, through induced reductions in uteroplacental blood flow.[2][4] Other factors contributing to the development of eclampsia include maternal infections and inflammation, such as periodontal disease and urinary tract infections, which have been linked to an increased risk of preeclampsia. Moreover, maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, and metabolic disorders are significant contributors to the development of eclampsia, likely due to the associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.[4] Additionally, fetal conditions such as trisomy 13 and mirror syndrome (formerly Ballentyne syndrome), as well as complications from multiple gestations, can precipitate preeclampsia, which may progress to eclampsia if not managed effectively. The premature aging of the placenta and breakdowns in maternal-fetal immune tolerance further exacerbate the risk, indicating a complex interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of eclampsia.[2][4] ## Epidemiology Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are reported to affect approximately 10% to 20% of pregnancies in the United States (US).[1] However, the incidence of new-onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has increased by almost 50% in the last 15 years, primarily in rural and urban areas.[5] Moreover, the prevalence of postpartum preeclampsia ranges from 0.3% to
