injury in motor vehicle accidents.[29][30] Healthcare providers should encourage the adoption of safety measures such as wearing safety belts, avoidance of impaired driving, and alternative transportation strategies.[31][32][33] ## Pearls and Other Issues Point of care ultrasound has been accepted globally as a bedside examination in the emergency department. It also has been introduced to formal residency training. It allows a rapid and reproducible assessment of traumatic injuries without the risk of harmful radiation. Various studies have aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of thoracic ultrasound in the setting of traumatic hemothorax. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the sensitivity of ultrasound was influenced by the operator and the frequency of the transducer.[6] A prospective cross-sectional study demonstrated that ultrasound is a superior modality than radiography, but when compared to CT scan it showed a lower sensitivity.[7] A systematic review to determine the overall accuracy of ultrasound in traumatic thoracic injury has several limitations. Heterogeneous characteristics of ultrasound findings, with different machines, probes, and expertise levels affect the overall methodological quality of these studies.[5] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Point of care ultrasound in the evaluation of traumatic thoracic injury is a valuable adjunct tool. Its application in the setting of trauma has been studied and analyzed in multiple systematic reviews. Future randomized trials should be performed to assess relevant outcomes such as mortality, length of hospital stay and costs.[5][34] Nurses should monitor the chest tube output every hour during the initial admission; if the output is significant and continuous, the thoracic surgeon should be notified. While most cases resolve with a chest tube, if the hemothorax is not evacuated, it can lead to an empyema, which often requires surgery. The outcomes for most patients with isolated hemothorax are good.[35] (level V) ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22763&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22763) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/hemothorax/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22763) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22763/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22763) [![Image ](/books/NBK538219/bin/hemothorax.gif)](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Hemothorax, X-ray Contributed by Steve Bhimji, MS, MD, PhD [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Right side hemothorax Contributed by Vu Huy Tran, MD [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f3/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f3/?report=objectonly) Traumatic hemothorax arrest Contribute by Vu Huy Tran, MD [![Image ](/books/NBK538219/bin/Hemothorax__2.0.gif)](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f4/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538219/figure/article-22763.image.f4/?report=objectonly) Hemothorax Contributed by Vu Huy Tran, MD ## References 1.
