are transmitted by myelinated A-Î´ fibers to specific dorsal root ganglia. Patients often describe somatoparietal pain as a sharp, more intense, and more localized sensation compared to visceral pain.[19] **Referred Pain** Referred pain occurs due to the convergence of afferent neurons from different areas at a shared spinal cord level. When visceral and somatic pain signals converge, the brain cannot distinguish the visceral signals from the more common signals that arise from somatic receptors. As a result, the brain attributes the pain to the more familiar somatic regions rather than the internal organs. Common examples are pain due to cardiac ischemia felt in the neck, left shoulder, and down the left arm and cholecystitis felt in the left scapula.[19] ## History and Physical Most patients with acute abdominal pain have a self-limited etiology. The primary goal of the initial history and physical examination is to determine which patients require urgent or emergent intervention. Identifying a patient with a full-blown acute abdomen is typically less challenging compared to recognizing an incipient abdominal catastrophe in a patient presenting with early, nonspecific symptoms of abdominal pain, making a careful history and physical examination essential. **History** Key historical elements to consider include: - Location and radiation of the pain - Information regarding the onset, frequency, and duration of the pain - Pain severity - Pain description such as burning, gnawing, or stabbing - Precipitating factors such as eating or moving - Alleviating measures such as eating or assuming a particular position - Associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria, weight loss, anorexia, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or orthopnea - Sexual history, including risk for sexually transmitted infections, last menstrual period, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea - Past medical history, including previous surgeries, alcohol use disorder, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, to assess for the risk of bowel obstruction due to adhesions, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, gastritis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and liver dysfunction - Medication history, including medications that may cause constipation; recent antibiotic use, which may cause _Clostridioides difficile;_ nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications that increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease; and chronic corticosteroids that can cause immunosuppression - Alcohol consumption to assess for possible liver disease - Travel history for patients with a history consistent with colitis or gastroenteritis **Potential Causes of Pain Based on Location** The location of abdominal pain can provide valuable clues for clinicians in identifying the underlying
