brain supplied by small penetrating or perforating arteries, usually without collaterals. These include the lenticulostriate arteries from the middle cerebral artery, the thalamic perforators from the posterior cerebral artery, and the paramedian branches from the basilar artery. The underlying pathology of these penetrating arteries is small vessel arteriolosclerosis caused by hypertension, aging, smoking, diabetes, and other conventional vascular risk factors.[16] **Cerebral Autoregulation** Under physiological conditions, cerebral blood flow is primarily regulated by the resistance within the cerebral blood vessels, which correlates directly with their diameter. Vasodilation results in increased blood volume within the brain and heightened cerebral blood flow, while vasoconstriction produces the opposite effect.[17] Additionally, cerebral blood flow is influenced by fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral autoregulation denotes the ability to maintain relatively stable cerebral blood flow despite moderate shifts in perfusion pressure.[17][18] The precise mechanisms underlying autoregulation remain incompletely understood and likely involve multiple pathways. Evidence suggests that the smooth muscle in cerebral vessels reacts directly to changes in perfusion pressure by contracting with pressure elevation and relaxing with pressure reduction. Furthermore, decreases in cerebral blood flow may prompt blood vessel dilation by releasing vasoactive substances, although the specific molecules responsible have yet to be identified. Nitric oxide released by endothelial cells also appears to contribute to autoregulation. Ordinarily, cerebral blood flow regulation through autoregulation operates within a mean arterial pressure (MAP) range of 60 to 150 mmHg, albeit with individual variations in upper and lower limits. Beyond this range, the brain's ability to compensate for perfusion pressure changes diminishes, causing cerebral blood flow to rise or fall passively in response to pressure fluctuations. This passive response poses a risk of ischemia at low pressures and edema at high pressures. During certain pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke, cerebral autoregulation becomes impaired. As cerebral perfusion pressure declines, cerebral blood vessels dilate to augment cerebral blood flow.[19] However, if the decrease in perfusion pressure exceeds the brain's compensatory capacity, cerebral blood flow diminishes. Initially, an increase in the oxygen extraction fraction occurs to sustain oxygen delivery to the brain. Subsequently, as cerebral blood flow continues to decrease, additional mechanisms come into play. Protein synthesis is inhibited below a cerebral blood flow rate of 50 mL/100 g/min. Protein synthesis ceases altogether at 35 mL/100 g/min, and there is a transient increase in glucose utilization. When cerebral blood flow drops to 25 mL/100 g/min, glucose utilization declines significantly, and anaerobic
