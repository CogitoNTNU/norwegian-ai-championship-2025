in uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. **Uncomplicated Appendicitis** Uncomplicated appendicitis typically exhibits several characteristic features, including borderline-dilated serosal vessels, indicating increased appendiceal blood flow, and dulling of the serosa. Intraluminal neutrophils are another common finding. Furthermore, neutrophils may also be present within the mucosa and submucosa, and frank erosions may be seen. These findings indicate the presence of inflammation and tissue damage.[17] **Complicated Appendicitis** Complicated appendicitis with phlegmon exhibits several notable features. The appendiceal lumen is often dilated and filled with blood, indicating vascular congestion. Additionally, inflammation of the mesoappendix is observed, characterized by the presence of exudates. Neutrophils within the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria indicate a widespread inflammatory response. Extensive ulceration, signifying tissue damage and loss of epithelial lining, is commonly observed. Intramural microabscesses may also be present. Vascular thrombosis, resulting from the inflammatory process, is not uncommon. Complicated nonperforated appendicitis includes two distinct histopathologic categories: severe phlegmonous appendicitis and gangrenous non-perforated appendicitis. The histopathological findings of severe phlegmonous appendicitis are complex and are characterized by severe phlegmonous inflammation accompanied by obstruction and extraluminal fluid. The obstruction is usually caused by a fecalith, resulting in significant distal luminal dilation and adjacent fluid accumulation. The histological examination reveals pronounced transmural edema and infiltration of neutrophils throughout the appendiceal wall.[17] The histopathological examination of gangrenous appendicitis reveals a friable appendix with purple, green, or black discoloration. In addition, the appendix shows transmural inflammation, with areas of necrosis and extensive mucosal ulceration. These findings indicate a severe inflammatory process that has compromised the blood supply to the appendix, leading to tissue death and decay. **Complicated Perforated Appendicitis** In cases of complicated perforated appendicitis, the histopathological evaluation may exhibit features indicative of abscess formation, characterized by marked transmural inflammation and neutrophils infiltrating the affected tissue. The inflammation frequently extends beyond the appendix to involve the surrounding mesoappendix. Complicated perforated appendicitis is a severe inflammatory process involving the appendix and the surrounding tissues, manifesting as evidence of perforation, abscess formation, and high-grade inflammation.[17] ## History and Physical The primary symptom of acute appendicitis typically begins as a diffuse or periumbilical abdominal pain that eventually becomes localized to the right lower quadrant. Stimulation of the visceral T8-T10 afferent nerve fibers causes this initial vague abdominal pain. As the inflamed parietal peritoneum in the adjacent area becomes irritated, the pain becomes more focused in the right lower quadrant. Patients may experience pain that awakens them from
