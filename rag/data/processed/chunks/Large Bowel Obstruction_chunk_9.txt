no perforations noted in this cohort.[36] Some experts have voiced concern that stenting is associated with increased perineural invasion of malignant cells and questioned whether the observed invasion is secondary to the biology of the lesion or induced by the stenting. A study found stenting to be an independent risk factor for perineural invasion unrelated to the time interval from stenting to surgery. The study authors correlated this finding with the severity of the obstruction rather than the stenting, positing that the pathophysiology of the severe obstruction resulted in increased pressure, leading to local invasion. A meta-analysis found higher perineural and lymphatic invasion following stenting, decreasing overall survival.[37] Another meta-analysis found higher recurrence rates when stenting was used instead of an emergent stoma, with a lower 90-day mortality in the colostomy group versus those undergoing an emergent colectomy or stenting as a bridge to surgery. Higher costs in the stent group were identified, and more eventual anastomoses were found in the stoma group.[38] Current recommendations for treating a malignant obstruction following stenting include 2 cycles of chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin before operative intervention to address any theoretical risk for cancer dissemination.[6] **Alternative Interventions to Stenting** In addition to stenting, other options can bridge to surgery or provide palliative treatment for colonic obstruction. One such alternative is endoscopic dilation of the obstruction. Although stenting is more effective for malignancies and post-radiation strictures, balloon dilation is indicated for anastomotic or inflammatory strictures and often requires multiple dilations. The balloon catheter is positioned over a guidewire, inflated with saline, and then deflated and removed. The balloon size must be compatible with the lumen to minimize the risk of perforation. Dilation under fluoroscopic guidance is possible when available and involves the injection of dilute contrast into saline. Successful resolution of obstruction has been reported to be 89% following 1 dilation, with recurrent obstruction noted in up to 50% of cases within 5 years of the dilation procedure. Another alternative to stenting is decompression using a nasogastric or rectal tube, but overall, better short-term outcomes with stenting have been observed compared to decompressive tubing.[5] Studies have reported definitive resection and reconstruction following 7% to 14% of stent cases and 12% to 60% of balloon dilation cases.[35] **Surgical Procedures** Patients with malignant obstruction require surgery as a component of curative oncologic management. Surgical interventions range from a single-stage procedure intended to be curative to
