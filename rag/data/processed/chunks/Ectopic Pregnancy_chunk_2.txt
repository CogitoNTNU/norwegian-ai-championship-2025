: Due to infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia), prior pelvic or tubal surgery, or endometriosis - **Pelvic infections** : Including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and complications from ascending infections. - **Infertility and assisted reproductive technology** : Higher risk with increased embryo transfers, fresh (versus frozen) transfers, and cleavage-stage (Day 3) transfers - **Contraceptive use** : Although IUD users have a lower overall pregnancy risk, 53% of pregnancies occurring with an IUD are ectopic - **Smoking** : Associated with increased risk due to its impact on tubal function - **Advanced maternal age** :\*\*\*\* Women older than 35 have a higher risk - **Anatomical variations** : Congenital anomalies of the reproductive system may contribute - **Previous cesarean delivery** : Particularly in cases of prior breech presentation deliveries - **Progesterone-only contraception** : Slightly increased risk compared to other methods [1][4][7][2][5] Conversely, oral contraceptives, prior pregnancy termination, emergency contraception failure, and cesarean delivery are not associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.[4] ## Epidemiology Ectopic pregnancy accounts for approximately 1% to 2% of pregnancies in the United States and 2% to 5% among patients who have utilized assisted reproductive technology.[1][8] Emergency departments have reported a higher incidence of 6% to 16%.[7] However, the true prevalence may be underestimated due to cases managed outside hospital settings.[1] While the mortality rate from ruptured ectopic pregnancies has declined over the past few decades, they still contribute to pregnancy-related deaths. Furthermore, the various sites where ectopic pregnancy occurs have different incidences. Tubal ectopic pregnancies are the most common, with rupture rates around 15% in Western countries, a figure that may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] Cervical ectopic pregnancy has an incidence of \<1% and has been reported to occur following dilation and curettage in 70% of these patients. Ectopic pregnancies within the ovary occur in \<3% of cases, while abdominal implantation occurs in 0.9% to 1.4% of cases.[4] Abdominal pregnancies have a higher mortality than other types of ectopic pregnancy at 10%; however, due to a higher frequency of delayed diagnosis and up to 7 times higher risk of organ perforation and massive hemorrhage.[4] Interstitial ectopic pregnancies are reported in up to 4% of all ectopic implantation sites. Reports also exist of implantation sites in omental, retroperitoneal, splenic, and hepatic locations.[4][8] Additionally, the growing rate of cesarean deliveries, currently 21% of births worldwide, may contribute to an increase in cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies, which has an incidence of
