showing that the 1- and 5-year mortality for patients at age 60 is 7.4% and 24.4%, and for patients at age 80 is 19.5% and 54.4%. The mortality rates were similar when evaluated across different cardiac ejection fractions.[5][10][14] The prognosis is worse for those with heart failure who are hospitalized; those with heart failure commonly require repeat hospitalizations and develop an intolerance for standard treatments as the disease progresses. Data from the United States Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized during 2006 showed 30-day and 1-year mortality rates postadmission of 10.8% and 30.7,% respectively. Mortality outcomes at 1 year also demonstrate a clear relationship with age and increase from 22% for those aged 65 to 42.7% for patients aged 85 and older.[5][10] ## Complications **Potential Complications of Heart Failure** - Worsening clinical status despite aggressive therapy - Associated renal impairment and organ dysfunction can compromise heart failure treatment efforts - Recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure or, most commonly, associated co-morbidities, with resultant financial and personal costs to patients and families - The progressive loss of ability to carry out activities of daily life - Increased morbidity and mortality from the date of the patient's initial diagnosis of heart failure [1][5] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Effective treatment of comorbidities and risk factor reduction can decrease the chance of developing heart failure. Patient education should be focused on ensuring compliance with prescribed evidence-based treatments. - **Hypertension:** Effective treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension can reduce the risk of heart failure by approximately 50% - **Diabetes:** This condition\*\*\*\* is directly associated with the development of heart failure, independent of other associated clinical conditions. - **Alcohol:** Heavy alcohol use is associated with heart failure. - **Metabolic syndromes:** Following treatments based on evidence-based guidelines to decrease the risk of heart failure (ie, lipid disorders) is vital. - **Patient education:** Education regarding dietary salt restriction and fluid restriction is imperative.[1] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Treating heart failure and acute decompensated heart failure is challenging despite the use of maximal evidence-based therapy based on the stage of heart failure. Given the limited effect of current treatment strategies on the progression of heart failure, it is important to identify ways to maximize patient outcomes and quality of care by the interprofessional team. Patients at potential risk for heart failure based on comorbidities or other identified risk factors should receive appropriate evidence-based preventative counseling and treatments.
