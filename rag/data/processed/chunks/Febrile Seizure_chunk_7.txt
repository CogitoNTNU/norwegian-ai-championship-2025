if a patient's history is consistent with a complex febrile seizure, a thorough evaluation is recommended, which usually involves ruling out any structural or infectious causes and obtaining an electroencephalogram (EEG). Laboratory studies (eg, complete blood count, complete metabolic profile, and urinalysis) should also be performed if a patient has signs of dehydration, poor fluid intake, vomiting, or diarrhea.[4] Some cases of complex febrile seizures may require hospital admission for observation and further studies. No specific treatment for simple or complex febrile seizures is indicated other than supportive care and evaluation for possible underlying conditions causing the fever. In patients with febrile status epilepticus or seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes, intravenous benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam can be used. Follow-up as an outpatient with their pediatrician and neurologist, as indicated. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Febrile seizures are a common condition in the pediatric population. Diagnosing and managing children with this condition should be done systemically in collaboration with an interprofessional team that includes pediatric or neonatology and neurology clinicians, pharmacists, EEG and laboratory technicians, and radiologists. The clinical team should educate the family that even though dramatic in appearance, these seizures do not lead to chronic neurological disease or dysfunction. The more parents are aware of this disorder, the less likely it is that they will rush to the emergency room or seek alternative, unproven remedies. However, the parents should also be educated on when to bring the child with a seizure to the emergency department because, in some cases, the cause may be a virus or a bacterial infection of the brain. The pharmacist should educate the family on managing the fever with acetaminophen, not aspirin. However, the family should also be educated that antipyretics do not prevent future febrile seizures.[25][26] Finally, patient families should be informed that febrile seizures do not lead to any adverse neurological or psychological problems. An interprofessional team approach to the care of febrile seizures will lead to the best outcomes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=21653&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=21653) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/child-health/febrile-seizure/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=21653) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/21653/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=21653) ## References 1.
