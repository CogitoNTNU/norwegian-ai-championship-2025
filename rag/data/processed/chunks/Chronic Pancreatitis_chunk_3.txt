if further injury or stress occurs. - Established chronic pancreatitis to end-stage chronic pancreatitis: Disease features worsen unless therapeutic intervention leads to resolution. Key pathological changes include: - Immune dysregulation leading to fibrosis or sclerosis - Acinar cell dysfunction leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Islet cell dysfunction leading to pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3c) - Characteristic pain leading to chronic pain syndrome - Metaplasia leading to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ## Histopathology Histopathological examination of chronic pancreatitis reveals a significant increase in connective tissue surrounding the lobules and ducts. The acinar architecture is often distorted, with fibrosis becoming more prominent in later stages. Precipitated protein deposits may also be observed in the ducts. Distortion of the ductal system can produce a characteristic chain of lakes on computed tomography (CT) scans. Pathologic fibrosis alone cannot serve as a definitive criterion for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. Variations in histological presentation across different etiologies, along with the possibility of minimal or absent fibrosis in late-stage disease when biopsies are typically performed, limit its diagnostic reliability.[19][20] The histopathology of SPINK1-associated chronic pancreatitis closely resembles that of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis, showing a loss of exocrine parenchyma replaced by fibrosis.[21] In contrast, progressive lipomatous atrophy of the pancreas is observed with PRSS1-associated hereditary chronic pancreatitis, CFTR mutations, and hypertriglyceridemic chronic pancreatitis.[22] ## History and Physical Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with prolonged abdominal pain, often with intermittent pain-free periods. The pain may improve when leaning forward. However, some patients remain asymptomatic. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea (greasy, foul-smelling, difficult-to-flush stools), and weight loss. As the disease progresses, glucose intolerance or pancreatic diabetes may develop. During acute episodes of severe abdominal pain, patients may instinctively draw their knees towards their chest to alleviate discomfort. On physical examination, focal or diffuse abdominal tenderness is commonly observed. In some cases, a palpable mass may indicate the presence of a pseudocyst. Signs of malnutrition are frequently observed in long-standing diseases. ## Evaluation When chronic pancreatitis is suspected, the new mechanistic definition can aid in diagnosis. This approach integrates clinical features (typical signs, symptoms, and family history) with risk factors (see **Table.** Modified TIGAR-O Pancreatitis Risk/Etiology Checklist). Biomarkers further support the diagnosis and may include the following: [23] - Serum markers - Amylase - Lipase - Glucose - IgG4 - Triglycerides - Tumor markers - Nutritional deficiencies - Hypovitaminosis A, D, K, and B12 - Additional tests - Sweat chloride levels
