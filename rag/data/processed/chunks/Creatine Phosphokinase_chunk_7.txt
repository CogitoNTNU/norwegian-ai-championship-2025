to unwarranted treatment or complications, delayed diagnoses, and unnecessary follow-up, among other consequences.[72] A QMS framework provides the laboratory with a set of essential building blocks, including well-defined objectives, standards, and procedures concerning quality management, employee training, education, calibration, maintenance of lab equipment, raw material or test sample handling, instrumentation and control processes, laboratory safety, and records management and reporting.[73] Neglecting these elements can compromise the laboratory quality management system (LQMS), leading to inaccurate laboratory results, barriers to regulatory compliance, and lowered customer expectations.[74] Quality control (QC), often called internal quality control, involves continuously monitoring a measurement procedure to ensure that results obtained from patient samples adhere to performance criteria suitable for patient care.[75] QC plays a crucial role in recognizing and addressing any error conditions. When the result of a QC material falls within acceptable limits of the expected value, this confirms the stability and functioning of the measurement procedure, enabling a higher confidence level in reporting patient sample results. Conversely, suppose a QC result falls outside the acceptable limits. In that case, the QC result signals a potential malfunction in the measurement procedure, indicating a likelihood that patient sample results might not be suitable for clinical use, necessitating corrective measures.[76] In cases where corrective action is required, patient sample measurements should be re-evaluated when the measurement procedure has been restored to ensure stable and accurate performance. When erroneous results have been reported before identifying the error condition, issuing a corrected report is necessary. The quality control materials are measured periodically along with patient samples.[77] For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least 2 levels of control materials every 24 hours. Laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.[78] To reduce the frequency of quality control (QC) when conducting tests that require fewer checks than those mandated by regulatory agencies (eg, monthly), laboratories can create an Individualized Quality Control Plan (IQCP). This involves conducting a risk assessment of all potential sources of error throughout the testing process and implementing a QC plan to minimize the likelihood of errors.[79] The Levey-Jennings plot is the most commonly used format for evaluating QC results.[80] This format presents each QC result chronologically, offering a quick visual means to evaluate performance.
