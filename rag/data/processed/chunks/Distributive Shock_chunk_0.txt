In distributive shock, systemic vasodilation leads to decreased blood flow to the brain, heart, and kidneys damaging vital organs. Additionally, fluid leaks from the capillaries into the surrounding tissues, further complicating the clinical picture. further complicating the clinical picture. There are multiple etiologies of distributive shock and treatments for distributive shock are multimodal. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of distributive shock and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients. **Objectives:** - State the etiology of distributive shock. - Describe the presentation of a patient with distributive shock. - List the management options for distributive shock. - Employ interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of distributive shock and improve patient outcomes.

Systemic vasodilation leads to decreased blood flow to the brain, heart, and kidneys causing damage to vital organs. Distributive shock also leads to leakage of fluid from capillaries into the surrounding tissues, further complicating the clinical picture. Due to the complexities of this disease, the causes and treatments for distributive shock are multimodal.[1][2][3] ## Etiology The most common causes of distributive shock in the emergency department are sepsis and anaphylaxis. In cases of trauma, the neurogenic shock should also be on the differential. Other less common causes of distributive shock include adrenal insufficiency and capillary leak syndrome. Drug overdose or toxicity should always be considered, particularly potent vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers and hydralazine.[4][5][6] Distributive shock as a result of sepsis occurs due to a dysregulated immune response to infection that leads to systemic cytokine release and resultant vasodilation and fluid leak from capillaries. These inflammatory cytokines can also cause some cardiac dysfunction, called septic cardiomyopathy, which can contribute to the shock state. A common cause is
