Respiratory Distress - Myocardial Infarction - Infection - Shock - Death ## Consultations Management of gastrointestinal bleeding is teamwork. Following specialties work hand in hand to improve outcomes. - Gastroenterology - Critical care - General surgery - Interventional radiology ## Deterrence and Patient Education _H pylori_ eradication regimen should be started if _H pylori_ is present in case of peptic ulcer disease. Eradication of _H pylori_ has shown to reduce the risk of recurrent ulcer hemorrhages. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided and use COX-2 inhibitors which have less risk of ulcer hemorrhage. If it is not possible to avoid NSAIDs, use the lowest dose and duration. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) or misoprostol therapy should be used along with NSAIDs. Increased physical activity prevents the progression of diverticular disease. Aspirin and NSAID increase the risk of diverticulitis diverticular bleeding.[17] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Care of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding requires coordinated and efficient interprofessional cooperation. Nurses manage the frequent monitoring of vital signs and more short-term interaction with and observation of patients. They must communicate their findings with the providers, who use their own and nursing observations to make decisions for treatment. Multiple providers may be necessary for treatment. General internists are typically responsible for the routine care of patients with GI bleeds. Critical care providers may be involved if the patient warrants ICU-level care for severe hemorrhages. Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic examinations and treatment if able during those procedures. Radiologists will interpret various imaging modalities and conveying those results to the providers. Interventional radiologists may perform diagnostic procedures, with the ability to also perform therapeutic modalities such as angiography-guided embolization. In some severe cases, general surgeons may be involved in intervention or exploratory procedures. Pharmacists are essential for providing oversight of medications used in the setting of bleeds and ensuring the use of proper dosages. A coordinated effort by all of these healthcare professionals functioning as an interprofessional team is necessary for early recognition and intervention in gastrointestinal bleeds to prevent further morbidity or mortalities. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22101&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22101) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/gastrointestinal-bleeding-gi-bleed/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22101) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22101/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22101) [![Sengstaken–Blakemore tube Olek Remesz wiki-pl: Orem, commons: Orem CC BY-SA 3](/books/NBK537291/bin/Sengstaken-Blakemore_scheme_EN.svg.gif)](/books/NBK537291/figure/article-22101.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK537291/figure/article-22101.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Sengstaken–Blakemore tube Olek Remesz (wiki-pl: Orem, commons: Orem) \[CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], from Wikimedia Commons ## References 1.
