marked by liquefactive necrosis and mixed inflammatory infiltrates, may develop; the serosal surface may show fibrinopurulent exudates, indicating secondary peritonitis. Prolonged ischemia can also cause vascular thrombosis in mesenteric veins, worsening ischemia and infarction. Reperfusion after ischemia leads to oxidative stress and neutrophilic infiltration, contributing to cellular injury and inflammation. Histological features vary depending on the etiology of SBO. For example, adhesions and bands typically show fibrosis and mesothelial hyperplasia at adhesion sites, while strangulated hernias display congestion, necrosis, and inflammation. Tumor-related obstructions reveal malignancy-specific features, such as glandular structures in adenocarcinoma or spindle cells in stromal tumors. Crohn disease presents with transmural inflammation, noncaseating granulomas, and fibrosis, whereas radiation enteritis shows vascular sclerosis, submucosal fibrosis, and ulceration. Increased intraluminal pressure also leads to endothelial tissue remodeling, which alters the epithelial cell type to withstand the mechanical forces exerted by extraluminal factors such as tumors and adhesions.[20] Fibrous tissue thickening and adhesions can also replace simple columnar epithelial cells, obstructing gastrointestinal absorption and interfering with normal small intestine functions. Consequently, patients with SBO often present with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, obstipation, constipation, and abdominal distention.[21] ## History and Physical **History** A patient's history and physical examination are essential for diagnosing SBO and determining its severity. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain, which is often crampy and colicky, correlating with peristalsis as the bowel attempts to overcome the obstruction. The pain may become constant and severe if the obstruction worsens. Vomiting is another hallmark symptom, especially with proximal obstructions, and may start with gastric contents before becoming bilious as the obstruction becomes more distal. Persistent vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic alkalosis. Abdominal distension, due to the accumulation of gas and fluids above the obstruction, is common and may be particularly noticeable in high or complete obstructions. Changes in bowel movements, including obstipation or decreased stool and gas passage, are also typical, though partial obstructions may still allow for some output early on.[22] A key component of the history is identifying prior abdominal surgeries, particularly those that could lead to adhesions, as postoperative adhesions are the most common cause of SBO. A history of abdominal hernias or malignancies should also be explored, as these conditions are significant risk factors for SBO. Additionally, the patientâ€™s medical history may reveal conditions like Crohn disease, radiation therapy, or neurological disorders, which can predispose them to impaired motility and SBO. **Physical**
