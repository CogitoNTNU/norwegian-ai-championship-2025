side branches.[19] In AWMI, specific patterns of ST-segment elevation and depression can provide diagnostic information. The ECG findings in anterior MI also have prognostic implications. A greater number of leads with ST-segment elevation indicates a larger area of infarction and is associated with an increased risk of mortality.[20] - ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V1 through V4, along with ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF, suggests an anterior wall or antero-basal ischemia/infarction most likely due to occlusion of the proximal portion of the LAD. - ST-segment elevation in leads V3 through V6 and no ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF, ischemia, most likely due to occlusion of the distal portion of the LAD.[21][22] - Anterior myocardial infarction is characterized by ST elevations in precordial leads. The specific leads corresponding to different regions are as follows: V1-V2 are septal leads, V3-V4 are anterior leads, and V5-V6 are lateral leads. Therefore, analyzing territorial changes in these leads can help determine the area of the myocardium at risk. - A septal infarct is denoted by ST elevation in leads V1-V2 - An anterior infarction is indicated by ST elevation in leads V2-V5 - An anteroseptal infarction is identified by ST elevation in leads V1-V4 - An anterolateral is denoted by ST elevation in leads V3-V6, I, and aVL - Extensive anterior/anterolateral wall MI is marked by ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL[23] **Cardiac enzymes:** Troponin-I is the preferred test for diagnosing patients with anterior wall infarction. However, awaiting the results should not delay reperfusion in patients with clinical evidence of ischemia and anterior ST elevation on EKG. When using a high-sensitivity assay, evidence of ischemia can be obtained within 2 to 3 hours of presentation. Serial testing is recommended for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with negative initial troponin results. **Serologic testing:** Renal function test, liver function test, and lipid panel are essential components of a comprehensive assessment of anterior myocardial infarction. **Chest X-ray (CXR):** In patients without heart failure, CXR is typically unremarkable. However, in the setting of pulmonary edema, it may show interstitial prominence, alveolar infiltrates, and hilar cephalization of pulmonary vessels. The presence of pulmonary edema is associated with a poor prognosis. **Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE):** Urgent revascularization should not be delayed in patients with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, TTE can be helpful if symptoms or ECG changes are
