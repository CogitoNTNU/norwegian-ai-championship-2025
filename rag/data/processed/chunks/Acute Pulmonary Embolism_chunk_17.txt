with the other care team members to identify deficits and develop a tailored care plan to address these deficits within safe parameters for each patient. ## Pearls and Other Issues A timely diagnosis of PE is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of VTE and PE since the incidence of recurrent thromboembolism is high. Notably, 30% of untreated patients with PEs die, while only 8% die after timely therapy. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of acute PE requires seamless interprofessional collaboration to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure patient safety. Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as an innovative approach to addressing the complexities of PE treatment. Composed of specialists in pulmonary medicine, critical care, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery, PERTs facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention, ensuring that patients benefit from the collective expertise of diverse disciplines. Studies demonstrate that PERTs improve communication, streamline treatment efforts, and lead to more coordinated and effective care. In the larger framework of an interprofessional team, nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practitioners play pivotal roles alongside physicians. As frontline clinicians, nurses contribute critical observations and ensure the timely implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Pharmacists, as experts in anticoagulation therapy, provide essential input on drug selection, contraindications, and potential interactions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatment. Open communication and mutual respect among all healthcare professionals allow for comprehensive and well-informed decision-making, empowering each team member to contribute actively to patient care. By fostering a collaborative environment, PERTs and interprofessional teams optimize care coordination and team performance. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities, effective communication, and a unified strategy, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved safety in managing acute PE. Integrating diverse expertise within a cohesive team ensures patients receive timely, evidence-based, patient-centered care. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=42576&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=42576) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/acute-pulmonary-embolism-pulmonary-embolism/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=42576) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/42576/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=42576) [![Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism](/books/NBK560551/bin/800px-Pulmonary_embolism_ECG.gif)](/books/NBK560551/figure/article-42576.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK560551/figure/article-42576.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism.
