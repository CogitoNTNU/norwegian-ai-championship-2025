still had an unacceptably high false-positive rate, and a new, more specific biomarker was needed. Troponins were first identified in 1965, but a reliable immunoassay to detect their levels in the blood was not developed until the late 1990s.[14] Troponin measurements were found to have a near 100% sensitivity when checked 6 to 12 hours after the start of chest pain and have a significantly improved specificity for cardiac muscle damage compared to previous biomarkers.[9] Due to its clinical usefulness, serial troponin testing was added to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, the current definition used by the American College of Cardiology.[15] ## Pathophysiology Myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow is blocked in the coronary vessels that supply the heart muscle with oxygen.[16] This causes a mismatch where the oxygen supply is not meeting the oxygen demand of the myocytes, leading to necrosis and cell death.[17] During this process, the cell membranes are ruptured, causing intracellular contents to spill into the extracellular space, eventually making their way into the bloodstream.[18] If these cellular contents, including troponins, are spilled in large enough quantities, they can be detected in the circulating blood.[16] A basal amount of troponin is found in the circulation of healthy individuals from the regular turnover of cardiac myocytes.[19] Troponin indicates pathophysiologic muscle damage when the measured value is greater than the 99th percentile of the normal range, about three standard deviations above the mean.[20] According to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, a cTn value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit is defined as myocardial injury.[15] The injury is considered acute if there is a rise, fall, or a rise and fall in cardiac troponins values.[21] Troponin levels typically start to elevate in the circulation within two to three hours of the onset of chest pain. The levels will continue to rise until a peak is reached, generally between 12 and 48 hours. The troponin level will then fall to normal over the next four to ten days.[22] This expected rise and fall of the troponin can help distinguish a myocardial infarction from other causes of elevated troponins.[23] The actual half-life of both cTnI and cTnT is short â€“ approximately two hours in plasma. However, because of the continued release of troponin from the necrotic myocardium, the apparent half-life is 24 hours, with cTnT slightly longer.[24] Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) have
