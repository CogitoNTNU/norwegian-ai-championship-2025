reported in 64% to 85% of cases.[24] Chest pain is typically sudden, unilateral (though rarely bilateral), sharp or stabbing, pleuritic, and may radiate to the ipsilateral shoulder or arm. The severity of symptoms varies, depending on the extent of the lung collapse. In cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, symptoms may gradually improve after 24 hours, possibly due to the spontaneous reabsorption of air from the pleural space. Other possible symptoms include anxiety and cough, though these are less common. Physical examination findings depend on the size of the pneumothorax. In small pneumothoraces, the exam may be entirely normal. However, the affected side may have absent breath sounds in larger pneumothoraces. Many patients experiencing a first-time spontaneous pneumothorax may delay seeking medical attention for several days. Hypoxia (oxygen saturation below 90%) is rare, occurring in only 3% to 11% of cases.[25] **Tension Pneumothorax** Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention.[26] In addition to chest pain and shortness of breath, patients with tension pneumothorax exhibit hemodynamic compromise, which can include profound hypoxia and hypotension. The pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax involves the gradual accumulation of air in the pleural space caused by a one-valve effect that prevents air from escaping. The increasing intrapleural pressure leads to a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, compression of the vena cava, and decreased cardiac output, ultimately resulting in severe hypotension and hypoxia. On physical examination, classic findings of tension pneumothorax include absent breath sounds on the affected hemithorax, tracheal deviation to the contralateral side, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention. If left untreated, tension pneumothorax rapidly leads to hemodynamic collapse and death. Patients on mechanical ventilation who develop pneumothorax due to barotrauma experience a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure and hemodynamic instability, often presenting more abruptly compared to those breathing spontaneously.[27] Early recognition is critical in these cases, as symptoms may rapidly progress to cardiorespiratory failure. ## Evaluation The diagnosis of pneumothorax is based on a combination of patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, with chest x-rays being the primary imaging modality (see **Image.** Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax). However, small pneumothoraces are often missed on physical examination and chest x-rays and may be detected incidentally on CT scans performed for other indications (see **Image.** Rib Fracture).[1][28] In cases of moderate-to-severe pneumothorax, arterial blood gas analysis may reveal hypoxia and, in patients with underlying COPD, occasional hypercapnia.[29] Spontaneous pneumothorax should always
