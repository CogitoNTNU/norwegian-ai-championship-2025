This functional data is needed to care for patients with many pathologies and used to diagnose a number of diseases. This activity discusses echocardiography procedure details including relevant anatomy, clinical indications, and potential limitations and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in caring for patients requiring this valuable diagnostic test. **Objectives:** - Identify the indications of echocardiography. - Describe the equipment/personnel needed in performing echocardiography. - Review the clinical significance of various echocardiographic modalities. - Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance echocardiography and improve outcomes.

Although, prior to the invention of today's routinely used 2-dimensional echocardiography, there was motion-based (M-mode) echocardiography. In 1953, Inge Edler, regarded as the father of echocardiography, first described M-mode technology, which began the era of diagnostic noninvasive echocardiography.[1] M-Mode echocardiography was the combination of amplitude-based (A-mode) ultrasonography with Brightness-based (B-mode) techniques, which allowed the addition of a "time" dimension when the B-mode was swept across the oscilloscope; however this was not a picture, per se, but how structures evolved through the cardiac cycle.[2] This was the primary technology until two-dimensional (2D) ultrasonography was developed over the next decades. In 1973, S.L. Johnson developed 2D ultrasonography and doppler technology, which ultimately allowed physicians to detect blood flow in vessels, and, in 1979, Holen and Hatle found that by using the Bernoulli equation they could detect pressure gradients.[1] The combination of all these technologies is the echocardiography that is commonly used every day in today's medical profession. The most commonly used technique among these is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This allows the clinician to obtain real-time sizes, structure, and function of the heart during the cardiac cycle. Another useful and important use of these methods is stress echocardiography. Stress echocardiography is the combination of standard transthoracic echocardiography and either pharmacological or physical stress to the cardiac structures to assess
