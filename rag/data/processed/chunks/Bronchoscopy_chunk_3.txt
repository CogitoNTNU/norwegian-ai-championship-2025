managed conservatively, while symptomatic and large pneumothorax will require chest tube insertion and hospitalization. A tension pneumothorax results in hemodynamic instability and should be recognized even without imaging studies. Appropriate life-saving measures such as chest tube insertion should be undertaken immediately. Most pneumothoraces after bronchoscopy develop within the first hour of the procedure but can be delayed up to 24 hours. Appropriate instructions to the patient and appropriate follow up should be arranged. - Cardiac arrhythmias may also occur especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. - Other potential complications of the procedure include trauma to the vocal cords, pneumomediastinum, hypoxia, and rarely death. ## Clinical Significance Bronchoscopy is helpful in the diagnosis and management of various airway and lung diseases. With further advances in technology, a bronchoscopy will not only continue its current role in clinical practice but will expand its scope as a minimally invasive advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tool. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes an interprofessional team skilled in the care of patients with airways and lung disease and adept in the use of bronchoscopy equipment is essential to performing bronchoscopy safely and manage complications. In addition to a skilled bronchoscopist, personnel includes an endoscopy nurse and respiratory therapist or technician trained in the use of bronchoscopy equipment. If general anesthesia is used for the procedure, additional personnel include anesthesiologist and/or nurse anesthetist. Many bronchoscopy suites also use rapid on-site cytologic evaluation of specimens by a pathologist or cytology technician.[10][11][12] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18657&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18657) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/bronchoscopy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=18657) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18657/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18657) [![Image ](/books/NBK448152/bin/Bronchoscopy__image.gif)](/books/NBK448152/figure/article-18657.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK448152/figure/article-18657.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Bronchoscopy parts and bronchoscopic view of the airways Contributed by Mahmoud Naser ## References 1.
