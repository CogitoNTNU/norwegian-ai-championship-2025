placed MDMA in Schedule I in 1985, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. However, a recent landmark double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial found that MDMA may be highly effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combination with psychotherapy.[1] As a result, the use of MDMA for PTSD treatment is in the process of FDA approval. MDMA is mainly available in colorful tablets with logo brands but may also be in capsule, powder, and liquid forms. Its use mainly involves swallowing tablets, but sometimes, it may be crushed and insufflated. Its effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hepatic systems can be life-threatening, and recognizing its toxicity is essential for clinicians in emergency settings.[2][3] ## Etiology The potential for MDMA toxicity exists with each ingestion, substantiating its designation as a Schedule I drug. MDMA is commonly ingested in tablet form; however, the tablet may be crushed and ingested intranasally. Recreational doses of MDMA can vary significantly from 50 mg to 200 mg per tablet. However, analysis of compounds sold as ecstasy or molly has revealed mixed composition with other substances, including methyl diethanolamine (MDEA, also known as "eve"), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA, also known as "sally"), ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol, inactive substitutes, some producing hemodynamic effects.[4][5][6] As a result, significant adverse effects and toxicity can occur with one-time or first-time ingestion due to the unknown dosage and composition of the drug.[7] MDMA is commonly used with other recreational drugs, which can potentiate or antagonize the toxic effects on the neurological and cardiovascular systems.[3][8] Combined with physical activity in a hot, humid environment, this compounding effect can lead to significant hyperthermia, dehydration, and hyponatremia, mimicking the effects of heat stroke in many cases.[9] ## Epidemiology Trends in MDMA use are well documented throughout the years, with user age ranging from the 8th grade to the collegiate level and adulthood. A review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s and early 2000s. For example, lifetime MDMA use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 and 1990, while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 and 1999.[10] From 1999 to 2000, lifetime use among 8th graders increased from 2.7% to 4.3%, while this increase was significantly greater in 12th graders (8%-11%).
