Anaphylaxis, Hives. 1. Respiratory symptoms: Dyspnea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxemia, inability to maintain patency; persistent cough or throat clearing can be heralding symptom 1. Hypotension: Systolic less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease of greater than 30% from baseline 1. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Persistent painful cramps or vomiting Known exposure to an antigen and hypotension (systolic less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease of greater than 30% from baseline). It is not required to meet these criteria to treat; it is only to serve as a guide for diagnosis. Angioedema can also mimic these symptoms. A key differentiation between angioedema and anaphylaxis is urticaria; the oral symptoms and need for airway control can otherwise mimic each other. When in doubt, treat aggressively. Laboratory testing is of little to no use, as there is no accurate testing for diagnosis or confirmation. Serum histamine is of no use due to transient elevation and late presentation. Serum tryptase can be considered for confirmation of an anaphylactic episode as it remains elevated for several hours; however, as a diagnostic modality, this has low sensitivity. Kounis syndrome (allergic angina): This is myocardial infarction or ischemia that can occur in the setting of anaphylaxis.[14] ## Treatment / Management **Triage** Triage any allergic reaction with urgency as they are at risk for rapid deterioration with the development of anaphylaxis, if not already anaphylactic.[15][16][17] **Airway** Airway management is paramount. Thoroughly examine the patient for airway patency or any indications of an impending loss of airway. Perioral edema, stridor, and angioedema are very high risk, and obtaining a definitive airway is imperative. Delay may reduce the chances of successful intubation as continued swelling occurs, increasing the risk for a surgical airway. **Decontamination** After the airway is secured, decontaminating offending agents (if known) is the next priority to prevent continued exposure and clinical worsening. Remove any stingers, if present. Do not attempt gastric lavage in cases of ingestion, as this may not be effective and delays treatment. **Epinephrine** Epinephrine is given through intramuscular injection and at a dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1,000 concentration of epinephrine. Pediatric dosing is 0.01 mg/kg or 0.15 mg intramuscularly (epinephrine injection for pediatric dosage). Intramuscular delivery has proven to provide more rapid delivery and produce better outcomes than subcutaneous or intravascular. Note if intravenous epinephrine is to be given, the concentration required is 1:10,000; see the next paragraph. The thigh is preferred
