The anesthesiologist needs to understand the disease process to avoid potential complications, including myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and death. This review focuses on the preoperative evaluation for patients with pulmonary hypertension and the appropriate intraoperative monitoring and ventilator management, pain control, and pharmacologic therapies for non-cardiac surgery. **Objectives:** - Review the preoperative evaluation needed for patients with pulmonary hypertension. - Discuss options for intraoperative monitoring. - Review some potential complications of pulmonary hypertension. - Summarize the pharmacologic therapies prescribed by the interprofessional team both in and out of the operating room.

Pulmonary hypertension is classified as a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg at rest and is definitively diagnosed by right heart catheterization.[1][2] It is caused by a combination of physiologic changes, such as vascular proliferation, arteriolar vasoconstriction, left heart disease elevating pulmonary venous pressure, and in-situ thrombosis. Over time, the consistently elevated pulmonary pressures begin to increase the right ventricular afterload, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and ultimately dysfunction.[3] Patients with pulmonary hypertension with or without right ventricular heart failure have significantly increased morbidity and mortality when undergoing anesthesia and surgery. The stress of the surgery can exacerbate pulmonary hypertension and lead to potential complications, including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, postoperative respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, delayed extubation, and longer length of stay in the intensive care unit and overall hospital admission.[4][5] A patient with pulmonary hypertension presents a challenge for the anesthesiologist. In addition to having an in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology, the anesthesiologist must optimize blood pressure with vasodilators or vasopressors, oxygenation, and ventilation, avoid exacerbating factors, and control pain throughout the procedure to help achieve the best perioperative outcomes.[6] This review article will discuss the general considerations for perioperative anesthesia management for patients with pulmonary hypertension with or without subsequent right
