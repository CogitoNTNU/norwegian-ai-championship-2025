were headaches, visual disturbances, and upper abdominal or epigastric pain.[2][11] While hypertension often accompanies eclampsia and is considered a distinguishing feature of the condition, it is not always present; some patients may develop eclampsia without severe blood pressure elevation. Conversely, not all patients with preeclampsia with severe features develop eclampsia.[10][11] Moreover, proteinuria, a standard marker of preeclampsia, may also be absent in some cases of eclampsia. Therefore, the clinical characteristics of eclampsia are not dependable indicators. Additionally, the absence of severe preeclampsia features in some patients with eclampsia challenges the common belief that preeclampsia will always worsen over time, eventually progressing to eclampsia.[2] Clinicians should be careful to consider differential diagnoses, including posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, that present similarly to eclampsia and require careful management, including blood pressure control and long-term follow-up.[2][11] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/78063)," for more information on this condition. Eclamptic seizures can occur before, during, or after delivery, with a significant number occurring during the antepartum period. Postpartum eclampsia, particularly late-onset eclampsia, defined as seizures occurring more than 48 hours after delivery, can still pose a significant risk. A large portion of these seizures occurs in the first 7 to 10 days postpartum, often presenting with neurological symptoms, including headache. Postpartum headaches should be carefully evaluated, especially if accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or visual disturbances, to rule out other severe conditions such as cerebral venous thrombosis or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.[11] ## Evaluation Eclampsia is typically the condition initially suspected in patients presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, especially those individuals with a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorder. Evaluating eclampsia primarily involves assessing various aspects of maternal and fetal health due to the conditionâ€™s potential impact on multiple organs and the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Because of the urgent nature of eclampsia, this evaluation is conducted alongside emergent therapeutic interventions.[10][11][16] The evaluation for eclampsia is centered around the diagnosis of preeclampsia as it is a known life-threatening complication of this disease process. In addition to serial maternal blood pressure measurements and continuous fetal monitoring, diagnostic studies should be performed to assess for indications of end-organ dysfunction, including proteinuria, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, central nervous system symptoms, pulmonary edema, and thrombocytopenia.[10][11][16] **Laboratory Studies** Key laboratory studies include liver function panels, platelet counts, and complete metabolic profiles to assess kidney function as performed for preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet
