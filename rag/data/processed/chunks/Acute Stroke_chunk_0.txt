Acute stroke can be categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic, with some overlap in risk factors and clinical presentations; however, their management approaches differ substantially. Ischemic strokes occur when blood vessels are obstructed, limiting the blood supply to the brain. In contrast, hemorrhagic strokes result from blood vessel rupture, causing blood to spill into the intracranial cavity. Interprofessional and multidisciplinary teamwork is necessary for promptly identifying, treating, and providing effective care to patients with acute stroke throughout their recovery and rehabilitation journeys. Clinical guidelines for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage advocate for interprofessional healthcare teams in prehospital and hospital settings to enhance patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary team provides rehabilitation services during and after hospitalization to facilitate functional recovery and promote patient independence for individuals who have experienced an acute stroke. This comprehensive overview of acute stroke is based on the current AHA/ASA (The American Heart Association/The American Stroke Association) Guidelines and relevant published literature. It is designed to update healthcare providers about this potentially disabling and life-threatening condition to maximize clinical recovery for each patient and reduce the global impact of stroke. **Objectives:** - Differentiate acute stroke from stroke mimics and ischemic etiology from hemorrhagic based on their varied clinical presentations, imaging findings, and management approaches. - Assess the neurological status and functional abilities efficiently of patients presenting with acute-onset focal neurological dysfunction to monitor their progress, identify complications, and adjust treatment plans accordingly. - Implement current evidence-based guidelines (eg, AHA/ASA guidelines) and treatment protocols for the management of acute stroke. - Recognize the importance of the interprofessional healthcare team in applying stroke rehabilitation strategies and pharmacological interventions to facilitate functional recovery and promote patient independence during and after hospitalization to enhance clinical outcomes.

A more accurate and meaningful term to describe it is
