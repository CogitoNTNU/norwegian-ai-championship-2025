Leukotriene inhibitors have shown to improve exercise-induced asthma by 50% for children 12 and older. The decision to step up therapy is based on control of symptoms, of how often short-acting inhaler is being used, nighttime awakenings, interference with activity and questionnaires. Compliance, inhaler technique, environmental control, and comorbidities should also be assessed. Consideration to step down therapy if asthma is controlled for at least 3 months. Patients using inhalers should be encouraged to use spacers, especially in children. Studies have shown if the inhaler is used appropriately with a spacer it is just as useful as a nebulizer machine. Allergen and environmental control are very important in asthmatics as well. The primary factor in the environmental control program is the avoidance of dust mites. Sensitivity to dust mites is a strong predictor of asthma and asthma severity. When controlling exposure to dust mites, it is recommended to encase mattresses and pillows in vinyl covers and wash all bedding every 1 to 2 weeks in hot water. Other measures include reducing humidity, removing carpets from bedrooms, and limiting lying on upholstered furniture. In rooms of children stuffed animals should be washed or removed from beds. If unable to remove rugs, using a HEPA filter will reduce allergen emissions. Wearing a mask while using a regular vacuum helps as well. Pets especially cats can also be a potential trigger for asthma and allergies and typically should be removed from the house. High exposure to cockroach allergen has been associated with the risk of asthma and the highest concentration in the kitchen. Allergy to fungus is a risk factor for asthma. When there are high spore counts in your location s person with asthma and allergies should avoid prolonged outdoor activity. Tobacco exposure should be avoided as it has been shown to increase medication requirements and also decrease lung function. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with increases in child risk of developing asthma. Air pollution can also contribute to exacerbating asthma as well. **Management of Acute Exacerbations** 1. Correcting severe hypoxemia through the application of oxygen and repetitive treatment with short-acting beta2 agonists 1. Rapid reversal of airflow obstruction 1. Reduction of the risk of relapse 1. \_**Anyone with peak expiratory flow below 50% needs immediate medical care.** \_ **Medications** - Combination of inhaled anticholinergic and beta2 agonist which have been shown to decrease hospitalization of school-aged children - Intravenous
