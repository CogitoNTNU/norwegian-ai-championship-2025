underlying lung disease such as COPD or interstitial lung disease, requires consultation with a pulmonologist to optimize management and prevent future episodes. If the patient requires ventilatory support or intensive care monitoring, anesthesiologists and critical care specialists may also be involved. In addition, in cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax resulting from medical procedures, collaboration with the primary treating specialist, such as an interventional radiologist or proceduralist, may be necessary to guide further management and prevent complications. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Preventing recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax requires patient education on risk factors and lifestyle modifications. Patients should be advised to avoid smoking, as it significantly increases the risk of recurrence. Activities involving significant pressure changes, such as scuba diving, high-altitude travel, and flying in unpressurized aircraft, should be cautiously approached, particularly in individuals with a history of pneumothorax. Patients with recurrent pneumothorax or underlying lung disease should be educated on recognizing early symptoms, such as sudden chest pain or shortness of breath, and should seek prompt medical attention. Patients who have undergone surgical interventions such as pleurodesis should be counseled on postoperative care and the potential for residual lung function changes. Long-term follow-up with a pulmonologist may be recommended to monitor lung health and prevent complications. ## Pearls and Other Issues Key considerations to keep in mind about acute pneumothorax include the following: - Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. - Symptoms include sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. - Tension pneumothorax may present with hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation away from the affected side, and respiratory distress. - Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds on the affected side, hyperresonance to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, distended neck veins, and hypotension. - Chest x-ray shows a visceral pleural line without lung markings beyond it. - Small stable pneumothorax (\<2 cm, minimal symptoms) can be observed with oxygen therapy. - Large or symptomatic pneumothorax (>2 cm) can be treated with needle aspiration or chest tube placement. - Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and should be treated with immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube placement. - Recurrent cases may require pleurodesis or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. - Prevention includes avoiding smoking, high-altitude travel, diving, or unpressurized flights. - Follow-up imaging should be obtained to ensure resolution. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Pneumothorax is a common condition, with over 5 million intensive care unit
