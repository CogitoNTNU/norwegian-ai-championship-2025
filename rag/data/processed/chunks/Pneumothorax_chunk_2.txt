Simple pneumothorax - No communication with the outside atmosphere - No mediastinal or diaphragmatic shift - Example: A pleural laceration from a fractured rib [15] - Communicating pneumothorax - Occurs when a defect in the chest wall creates an open connection between the pleura space and the external environment, such as a gunshot wound - Results in paradoxical lung collapse and severe ventilatory impairment [16] - Tension pneumothorax - Progressive air accumulation in the pleural cavity leads to: - Mediastinal shift to the opposite side - Compression of the vena cava and great vessels, reducing diastolic filling - Compromised cardiac output, leading to hemodynamic instability - Occurs when a one-way valve effect traps air in the pleural space, preventing its escape. - Catamenial pneumothorax - A rare, nontraumatic pneumothorax that occurs in women of childbearing age, typically within 3 to 4 days after menstruation onset - Often affects the right lung. - Believed to be caused by pleural endometriosis, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Other causes of pneumothorax include barotrauma, occurring from scuba diving or air travel, especially in individuals with preexisting lung disease.[17] In addition, individuals with underlying lung cysts or bullae are at an increased risk of developing pneumothorax in response to rapid pressure changes. ## Epidemiology The incidence of nontraumatic pneumothorax ranges from 7.4 to 18 cases per 100,000 people annually.[18] However, the risk is significantly higher among smokers, with a lifetime risk of 12% compared to 0.1% in nonsmokers.[19] Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly affects tall, thin-built young males, particularly those who smoke.[20] The condition has a high recurrence rate, with 20% to 60% of patients experiencing a recurrence within the first 3 years following their initial episode. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in individuals with underlying lung disease, resulting in significant variation in its epidemiology. Among patients with COPD, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax accounts for 50% to 70% of cases.[21] In 11% of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax instances, bacterial pneumonia was identified as the causative factor. In addition, pneumothorax is a known complication in 5% to 10% of pneumocystis pneumonia cases, further emphasizing the role of infections in its development.[22] ## History and Physical The clinical presentation of pneumothorax varies depending on its size and etiology. Some patients may be asymptomatic, and the condition may be diagnosed incidentally during the imaging performed for an unrelated reason.[23] The most common symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath,
