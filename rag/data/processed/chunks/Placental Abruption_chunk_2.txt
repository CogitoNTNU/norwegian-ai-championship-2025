- Diagnosis is made retrospectively **Class 1: Mild** - No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding. - Slight uterine tenderness - Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL - No signs of fetal distress **Class 2: Moderate** - No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding - Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions - Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure. - Evidence of fetal distress - Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia **Class 3: Severe** - No sign of vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding - Tetanic uterus/ board-like consistency on palpation - Maternal shock - Clotting profile alteration: hypofibrinogenemia and coagulopathy - Fetal death A classification of 0 or 1 is usually associated with partial, marginal separation, whereas a classification of 2 or 3 is associated with complete or central separation. ## Histopathology Once the placenta has been delivered, a retroplacental clot is almost always seen. In some cases, there may be evidence of blood extravasation into the myometrium, resulting in purple discoloration of the uterus's serosa. ## History and Physical Placental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome. The history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the womanâ€™s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen. The most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is
