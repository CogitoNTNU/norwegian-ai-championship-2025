molecule.[36] The assays vary from each other by the types of antibody used, by the epitopes to which they bind, and by the type of indicator molecule that is used.[46] cTnI assays are also used at the point of care.[47] In a two-site ELISA cTnI assay, heparinized whole blood or plasma is added to the single-use cartridge, which has an electrochemical sensor.[48] This initiates the assay and allows the monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody and ALP-conjugated monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody to dissolve into the sample. cTnI in the sample becomes labeled with an ALP-conjugated antibody and is captured onto the sensor surface during the incubation step.[49] Wash fluid containing enzyme substrate is then applied to remove unbound substances, and at the same time, ALP bound to the antigen-antibody complex reacts, releasing an electrochemically detectable product. The generated amperometric signal is directly proportional to the cTnI in the sample.[50] In another cartridge-based reader system, cTnI in EDTA whole blood or plasma is added to the system sample port via a transfer pipette. Red blood cells are separated from the plasma via a filter in the device, and a fixed plasma volume reacts with fluorescent-conjugated anti-cTnI antibodies.[51] The reaction mixture flows down the device until the fluorescent antigen-antibody complex is captured onto a discrete zone and fluorescence is detected.[52] The generated fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the sample.[53] The principle of the cTnT measurement is an ELISA one-step sandwich assay using streptavidin technology and electrochemiluminescence detection.[54] In the first incubation step (immunological reaction), the cTnT from the sample reacts with a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-cTnT antibody and a monoclonal cTnT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a sandwich complex. After adding streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex is bound to the solid phase via interaction with biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell, where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed, and a voltage is applied to the electrode.[31] A photomultiplier measures the emitted chemiluminescence, and results are determined via a calibration curve generated by a two-point calibration and a master curve (5-point calibration) provided via the reagent barcode.[55] The chemiluminescence is directly proportional to the cTnT concentration in the sample. The method is measured quantitatively using an automated instrument or at the point of care.[56] High-sensitivity testing for cardiac troponins was approved for clinical use in
