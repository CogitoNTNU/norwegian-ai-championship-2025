low probability of PE, the likelihood of PE is sufficiently low that further testing is not indicated. PERC is only valid in clinical settings with a low prevalence of PE (\<15%).[63] In hospital settings with a higher prevalence of PE (>15%), the PERC-based approach has substantially weaker predictive value.[64] Therefore, PERC criteria should not be used in patients with an intermediate or high suspicion of PE or inpatients suspected of having PE. **Pulmonary Embolism Diagnostic Evaluation Approach in Hemodynamically Stable Patients** An approach that combines clinical and pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and definitive diagnostic imaging is usually applied for most hemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE.[51] **Low probability of pulmonary embolus (Wells score** **< 2)** If PERC criteria are fulfilled, further testing is unneeded, and PE can be excluded. If PERC criteria are not met, then a D-dimer should be obtained. If D-dimer is negative, PE can be ruled out (\<500 ng/mL). CT pulmonary angiography should be performed if the D-dimer is positive (>500 ng/mL) in patients aged \<50 or higher after the age-adjusted D-dimer value. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, a V/Q scan should be performed. For a patient with an intermediate probability of PE (Wells score 2 to 6), measure D-dimer levels; if negative, PE can be excluded. If positive, then CTPA is done. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, a V/Q scan should be performed.[51] **High probability of pulmonary embolus (Wells score >6)** CTPA should be performed emergently in patients with a high likelihood of PE. Feasibility requires adequate scanner technology, and the patient must be able to lie flat, cooperate with exam breath-holding instructions, have a body habitus that can fit into the scanner, and have no contraindications for iodinated contrast. If the CTPA is inconclusive or not feasible, clinicians should perform a V/Q scan. A normal V/Q scan excludes PE. A PE may be diagnosed in patients with a V/Q scan demonstrating a high probability of PE. For a V/Q scan resulting in intermediate probability, further testing with lower extremity compression ultrasonography with Doppler is appropriate. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable and in whom definitive imaging is unsafe, bedside echocardiography or venous compression ultrasound may be used to obtain a presumptive diagnosis of PE to justify the administration of potentially life-saving therapies.[51] ## Treatment / Management **Initial Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolus** **Supportive measures** The initial approach to patients with PE should
