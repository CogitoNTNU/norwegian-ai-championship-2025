It occurs when air accumulates between the parietal and visceral pleura inside the chest. The air accumulation can apply pressure on the lung and make it collapse. Pneumothoraces can be even further classified as simple, tension, or open. A simple pneumothorax does not shift the mediastinal structures, as does a tension pneumothorax. An open pneumothorax also is known as a "sucking" chest wound. This activity examines when this condition should be considered in differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Recall the presence of a pneumothorax. - Describe the pathophysiology of a tension pneumothorax. - Summarize the treatment options for pneumothorax. - Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pneumothorax.

It occurs when air accumulates between the parietal and visceral pleurae inside the chest. The air accumulation can apply pressure on the lung and make it collapse (see **Image.** Upper Lobe Pneumothorax). The degree of collapse determines the clinical presentation of pneumothorax (see **Image.** Right Tension Pneumothorax Radiograph). Air can enter the pleural space by two mechanisms, either by trauma causing communication through the chest wall or from the lung by rupture of the visceral pleura. There are two types of pneumothorax: traumatic and atraumatic. The two subtypes of atraumatic pneumothorax are primary and secondary. A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) occurs automatically without a known eliciting event, while a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs after an underlying pulmonary disease. A traumatic pneumothorax can be the result of blunt or penetrating trauma. Pneumothoraces can be even further classified as simple, tension, or open. A simple pneumothorax does not shift the mediastinal structures, as does a tension pneumothorax (see**Image**. Left-Sided Tension Pneumothorax Radiograph). Open pneumothorax is an open wound in the chest wall through which air moves in and
