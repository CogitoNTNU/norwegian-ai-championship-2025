monitored using anti-factor 10a activity. However, monitoring is not indicated except in certain conditions like pregnancy and renal failure. - **Vitamin K Dependent Antagonists (VKA):** Warfarin, one of the most common anticoagulants available. It acts by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), which is needed for the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent factors (factors 2, 7, 9, 10, protein C and S). It has a narrow therapeutic window of dosing, and its effect is profoundly altered by certain factors including diet (leafy green vegetables, fruits like avocado, kiwi), medications, and genetic mutations in the VKOR complex which leads to resistance. It requires frequent monitoring with an international normalized ratio (INR).[5] - **Direct Thrombin Inhibitors:** Bivalirudin, argatroban, and dabigatran are direct thrombin inhibitors; these inhibit the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin. All products are renally metabolized. - **Direct Factor 10a Inhibitors:** These include rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban. Mechanism of action involves inhibition of the cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin by binding directly to factor 10a. These products are only orally administered. The terms direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), or target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) refer to those oral anticoagulants which specifically inhibit factors 2a (thrombin) or 10a. According to the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, DOACs is the preferred term. DOACs have been found to have similar effects when compared to other anticoagulants. Some studies have also shown possible decreased bleeding incidence with DOACs.[6][7] DOACs have increased ease of dosing with less susceptibility to dietary and drug interaction. ## Indications **Indications for Anticoagulation** The choice of anticoagulation should be a shared decision and tailored to the patient's preference, risk stratification, and medical condition.[8][9] Anticoagulants are indicated in several conditions listed below. The main indications for anticoagulation include atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and post-heart valve replacement. Venous thromboembolism is important because they sometimes are the first sign in multiple medical conditions.[10][11][12] **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)** Early anticoagulation (AC) with heparin is indicated for all patients with a documented diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. The choice of AC (heparin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, or bivalirudin) depends on the therapy instituted. AC has been found to lower the risk of thrombus formation when it started early and continued for more than 48 hours. Heparin (UFH) is indicated for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For those patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy, heparin is also
