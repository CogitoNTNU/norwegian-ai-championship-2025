acute and chronic respiratory failure, are discussed in this article. ## Etiology Respiratory failure can occur if there is an abnormality with any component of the respiratory system. Components of the respiratory system include the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the central and peripheral nervous systems, in addition to the chest wall and muscles of respiration.[1] The pathophysiology section of this article will review specific etiologies of respiratory failure. ## Epidemiology Respiratory failure (RF) is a syndrome caused by a multitude of pathological states; therefore, the epidemiology of this disease process is difficult to ascertain. In 2017, in the United States of America, however, the incidence of respiratory failure was found to be 1,275 cases per 100,000 adults. The case definition used in this study included all diagnosis codes that included respiratory failure as a component.[2] The epidemiology of respiratory failure is dependent mainly on the cause leading to the failure. Below, we list some common causes of respiratory failure and the relevant trends: - Acute myocardial infarction-related (AMI-RF): Between the years 2000 and 2014, 439,436 admissions due to AMI-RF were noted in 57% and required mechanical ventilation in 43% of total cases.[3] - Acute respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ranges in incidence from 10-80/100,000/y based on where it is recorded worldwide. This is partly due to different practices and thresholds for intubation in these cases and the use of different definitions of ARDs. According to one report, it is estimated that 10% of all patients admitted to ICU and 23% of mechanically ventilated patients meet ARDS criteria.[4] - Acute respiratory failure related to Coronavirus (COVID-19): It is estimated early in the COVID-19 pandemic that up to 79% of hospitalized patients developed respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.[5] - Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is the third most common etiology in patients hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure.[6] ## Pathophysiology **T** **ype 1 respiratory failure:** The distinguishing characteristic of Type 1 respiratory failure is a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg with a normal or decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). Depending on the cause of hypoxemia, the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient may be normal or increased. Formulas of the A-a gradient and alveolar gas equation are provided below, as these concepts are helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure. A-a gradient: - A-a gradient = PAO2 - PaO2, where - PAO2 =
