therapy is given to reduce the progression of hematoma.[4] This is especially important to reverse the coagulopathy in patients taking anticoagulants. Vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), etc., are used.[4][20][4] ASA recommends that patients with thrombocytopenia should receive platelet concentrate.[20] Patients with elevated prothrombin time INR should receive intravenous vitamin K and FFP or PCCs. FFP has the risk of allergic transfusion reactions. PCCs are plasma-derived factor concentrates containing factors II, VII, IX, and X. PCCs can be reconstituted and administered rapidly. The FAST trial showed that rFVIIa reduced the growth of the hematoma but did not improve survival or functional outcome.[26] rFVIIa is not recommended in unselected patients since it does not replace all clotting factors.[20] **Antiepileptic Therapy** Around 3 to 17% of patients will have a seizure in the first two weeks, and 30% of patients will show electrical seizure activity on EEG monitoring.[20] Those with clinical seizures or electrographic seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs. Lobar hematoma and the enlargement of hematoma produce seizures associated with neurological worsening. Subclinical seizures and non-convulsive status epileptics also can occur. **C** ontinuous EEG monitoring is indicated in patients with a decreased level of consciousness. Otherwise, prophylactic anticonvulsant medication is not recommended, according to ASA guidelines.[27] **Surgery** The different types of surgical treatment for hemorrhagic stroke are craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, stereotactic aspiration, endoscopic aspiration, and catheter aspiration.[4] The STICH trial showed no overall benefit from early surgery for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage compared with initial conservative treatment.[28] Those who have lobar hemorrhages within 1 cm of the surface of the brain and milder clinical deficits (GCS>9) may benefit from early surgery. Emergency surgical evacuation is indicated in cerebellar hemorrhage with hydrocephalus or brainstem compression.[21] Patients with cerebellar hemorrhages of >3 cm in diameter will have better outcomes with surgery. Cerebellar hematoma is evacuated by suboccipital craniectomy. Evacuation of brainstem hemorrhages can be harmful and is not recommended. A minimally invasive procedure such as stereotactic aspiration is also on trial. Hattori et al. showed in a randomized study that stereotactic evacuation is of value in patients with spontaneous putaminal hemorrhage, whose eyes will open in response to strong stimuli.[29] Minimally invasive surgery plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rt-PA) for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE) was a randomized, prospective trial that tested image-guided catheter-based removal of the blood clot.[30] It showed a reduction in perihematomal edema
