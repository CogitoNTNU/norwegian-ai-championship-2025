However, routine viral serological testing is not recommended, except for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV).[41] The incidence of uremic pericarditis has significantly declined with the introduction of dialysis.[45] In this subpopulation, pleuritic chest pain is less prevalent, and ECG changes are often absent. Chronically, these patients are more likely to develop pericardial effusions, though these are not frequently associated with acute cardiac tamponade. If pericardiocentesis is performed, the aspirate is often bloody in this patient population.[46] Cardiac catheterization may be considered to assess for diastolic pressure equalization and respiratory interventricular dependence if constrictive pericarditis is suspected. However, it is not recommended solely for diagnosing acute pericarditis.[46] Treatment for acute pericarditis begins with addressing the underlying cause. Patients with uremic pericarditis should receive more frequent dialysis, while those with malignancy or tuberculosis require therapy targeted at the primary disease. For tuberculosis, the standard treatment involves a quadruple antibiotic regimen (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for at least 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a total of 6 months. This may be combined with adjunctive high-dose prednisolone, as previously discussed.[42] Most patients will have idiopathic acute pericarditis, which can be safely managed on an outpatient basis with medical therapy alone. Activity restrictions beyond a sedentary lifestyle are advised until symptoms resolve or cardiac enzyme levels normalize.[47] Patients exhibiting markers of poor prognosis or those who do not respond to therapy within 1 week should be admitted for further evaluation. These markers include fever (>38 Â°C), a subacute or recurrent presentation, the presence of a large pericardial effusion (>20 mm in thickness), or echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade physiology, such as right ventricular diastolic collapse, a transmitral flow respirophasic variation of more than 25% throughout the respiratory cycle, and a dilated inferior vena cava with inspiratory collapse of less than 50%, indicating elevated right atrial filling pressures.[47][48] Minor risk markers include immunosuppression, trauma, or myopericarditis, where patients exhibit troponin elevation alongside elevated inflammatory markers. In most patients, empiric treatment with high-dose anti-inflammatory agents, in addition to colchicine, is recommended. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy should continue until symptom relief is achieved, which typically occurs within 3 days to 2 weeks. Possible regimens include ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours, indomethacin 25 to 50 mg every 8 hours, or naproxen 500 to 1000 mg every 12 hours.[49] Aspirin 500 to 1000 mg every 6 to 8 hours should be used instead of
