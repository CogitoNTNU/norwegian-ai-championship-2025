is outlined in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure.[1] For patients presenting with a sign or symptom of HFpEF, additional testing is recommended to establish the diagnosis and, if possible, the specific etiology; the presence of underlying comorbidities should also be determined and documented (see **Image.** Flowsheet). **Initial Evaluation: Laboratory Testing** **Complete blood count:** Anemia is an established risk factor for heart failure and negatively affects clinical outcomes; the negative impact is inversely proportional to the hemoglobin level.[62] **Serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium:** Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are strong adverse prognostic indicators in patients with heart failure.[63] **Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen:** Chronic kidney disease is an established risk factor for heart failure and negatively affects clinical outcomes; the negative impact is inversely proportional to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).[62] **Serum glucose:** Diabetes is a common comorbidity and an underlying risk factor for the development of HFpEF.[18] **Fasting lipid profile:** Multiple recent studies have suggested that dysregulation of lipid metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, HFpEF may alter lipid metabolism, and hypertriglyceridemia may increase the risk of mortality and rehospitalization in patients with HFpEF.[61][64][65] **Liver function tests:** Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; previously nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD) has been closely demonstrated to increase the development and progression of HFpEF.[66] It has been proposed that several MASLD-associated HFpEF phenotypes are commonly encountered in clinical practice.[66] **Iron studies, including serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation:** Intravenous iron therapy in symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with heart failure has been shown to improve functional status and quality of life and reduce hospitalizations for worsening heart failure.[67] **Thyroid-stimulating hormone:** Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states are underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure, and low triiodothyronine syndrome is commonly encountered in patients with HFpEF.[68] **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP):** Measurement of either natriuretic peptide is helpful to exclude or support a diagnosis of heart failure.[1] No scientific evidence exists to advocate using one test over another; using their respective values and endpoints interchangeably is inappropriate.[1] However, measuring natriuretic peptides in the outpatient setting in patients with dyspnea and an equivocal physical examination provides minimal diagnostic value.[1] Many cardiac and noncardiac conditions can cause elevation in natriuretic peptide levels, including advancing age, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease.[1] **Initial Evaluation: Noninvasive Testing and Cardiac Imaging** **12-lead electrocardiogram
