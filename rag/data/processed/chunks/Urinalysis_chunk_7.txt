addition to dietary adjustments, using intestinal oxalate binders like calcium citrate (without vitamin D) can help reduce oxalate absorption. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Hyperoxaluria](/pubmed/32644413)," for more information. **pH** Human urine typically has a pH between 4.5 and 8.0. Urine pH is crucial because variations can influence the crystallization of specific salts. The crystallization of calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, uric acid, cystine, and struvite stones depends on pH. While calcium oxalate precipitation is less pH-dependent than others, it generally occurs in acidic urine. Uric acid stones are most likely to form when urine pH is below 5.5, whereas calcium phosphate crystals tend to form in a more alkaline environment with a pH of 6.5 or above. Ideally, the average urine pH over 24 hours should be between 5.7 and 6.3 to minimize the risk of pH-dependent stone formation. Urinary pH can be adjusted through treatments such as potassium citrate and sodium bicarbonate, but it can also be affected by other medications, such as acetazolamide. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Acetazolamide](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17077)," for more information. **Proteinuria** About half of proteinuria is composed of uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), so urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios are often used to quantify abnormal urinary protein levels. Albumin excretion of more than 30 mg/24 hours is considered abnormal. Albumin levels of 30 to 300 mg per 24 hours are classified as stage 2 albuminuria (A2 or microalbuminuria). Albumin levels exceeding 300 mg per 24 hours are classified as stage 3 albuminuria (A3 or macroalbuminuria) (see **Table.** The National Kidney Foundation Albuminuria below).

The National Kidney Foundation Albuminuria Staging. ACR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio. \*Relative to levels in young adults. \*\*Including nephrotic syndrome (albumin excretion ACR >2220 mg/g) If amyloidosis or monoclonal gammopathy is suspected, measuring 24-hour urine light chains (Bence-Jones protein) is recommended. While a high correlation exists between urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and albuminuria, the correlation with urinary light chains is only moderate.[21] Protein levels of 3 g or more in 24 hours are indicative of nephrotic syndrome, as discussed above. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Microalbuminuria](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25100)" and "[Proteinuria](/pubmed/33232060)," for further information.[[43]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232060) **Sodium and Potassium** Urinary sodium excretion generally reflects dietary sodium intake. Increased urinary sodium excretion correlates with increased calcium excretion, making dietary sodium control crucial for managing hypercalciuria. Typically, lower-sodium diets permit up to 1500 mg of dietary sodium daily. Urinary potassium concentration is useful for assessing compliance with treatments like potassium citrate; these
