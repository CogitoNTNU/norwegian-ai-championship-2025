increases the interspinous distance, often narrowed due to degeneration. Secondly, it flattens the extra adipose tissue over the back and allows a shorter needle in most patients. A regular AP radiograph of the lumbar spine obtained before the procedure provides details of degenerative disease. Additionally, it is helpful to tilt the tube cranially by 10-15 degrees to align with the spinous process, mainly in older patients who have a reduced inter-spinous distance by degenerative disease. The prone position allows keeping the needle hub directly over the needle tip. It removes the parallax. A cross-table lateral view can confirm the depth and trajectory of the needle if a biplane camera is not available. **Prone Oblique Approach:** The patient in the oblique lateral position and the spinous processes are not midline. The inter-laminar and inter-spinous spaces appear wider than in the prone approach. Many radiologists favor this approach as patients with comorbidities better tolerate this position; however, the trajectory of the needle is difficult to assess on the lateral view. **Lateral Approach:** A lateral decubitus position is a preferred position**i** f the patient can't lie on their stomach because of obesity, backache, respiratory discomfort, shoulder pain, or medical conditions such as high blood pressure. The disadvantage is that this requires a newer biplane camera unit that is not universally available. Mobile single plane C-arm serves the same purpose, instead of newer biplane machines.[8][11] It is vital to make the wheal right at the site of entry. For example, a small metallic object or the tip of a needle marks the entry site with the help of fluoroscopy. Lidocaine HCL, 1% concentration, is injected using a 25 gauge needle for several millimeters into the subcutaneous tissue to create a wheal. After numbing the skin, local lidocaine via a 3.5 inch 25 gauge spinal needle is injected to gradually numb the deep fascia, muscles, and ligaments, periosteum under fluoroscopic guidance after confirming that the needle is not within the dura. Combining 1 ml of bicarbonate with 4-5 ml of lidocaine reduces the initial stinging of lidocaine. The LP needle should not be used to administer the lidocaine to avoid accidental injury to the spinal cord and nerves. Most physicians prefer 20 and 22 gauge needles with a length of 3.5 inches (8.8 cm). However, in some situations, such as individuals with obesity, longer needles with a length of 14 cm (5.5 inches) are required.
