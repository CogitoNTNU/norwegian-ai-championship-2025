a young patient with ventricular dysfunction (older patients are likely to have baseline calcifications). CT may also be used in patients with congenital heart diseases causing HF. Cardiac CT may help detect tumors causing HF. CT may also be used to evaluate stent patency and graft. **Myocardial perfusion imaging** SPECT-myocardial perfusion imaging\*\*\*\* helps define the presence of ischemia in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular dysfunction and not undergoing coronary angiography. This study is particularly useful for assessing CAD in patients with no history of ischemia but elevated troponin. ECG-gated myocardial perfusion imaging evaluates LVEF, regional wall motion, and regional wall thickening. EF measurement with this study may be affected in patients with an irregular heart rate, low count density, and extracardiac radiotracer uptake. ECG-gated images are also valuable for recognizing artifactual defects seen on SPECT imaging, eg, breast tissue and diaphragmatic attenuation.[42] **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging** Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\*\*\*\* has evolved as an essential tool when a discrepancy exists between the clinical stage of the disease and echocardiographic findings. It helps with the precise evaluation of volume, chamber sizes, and ventricular function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also assesses the stage of valvular heart disease in detail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also helps evaluate complex congenital heart diseases. The tool can also be used for noninvasive assessment of conditions, eg, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.[43] **Radionuclide multiple-gated acquisition scan** A radionuclide multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a reliable imaging technique for evaluating EF and is used in patients when a disparity of EF measurements from other studies is noted.[42] **Noninvasive stress imaging** Noninvasive stress imaging includes stress echocardiography, stress cardiac MRI, and SPECT imaging. These studies can be used to assess the benefit of coronary revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. **Genetic testing** Genetic testing is indicated for identifying genetic variants causing cardiomyopathies, eg, Titin, laminin A or C, myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin-T mutations.[44] ## Treatment / Management The goal of therapy for chronic HF is to improve symptoms and quality of life, decrease hospitalizations, and improve cardiac mortality. Pharmacologic treatment aims to control symptoms and to initiate and escalate drugs that reduce mortality and morbidity in HF.[1] Management for the respective stages of HF is outlined by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.[1] **Stage A Heart Failure Management** The recommended treatment for stage A (at-risk for
