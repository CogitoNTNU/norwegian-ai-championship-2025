cavity. The area around the pyogenic membrane includes lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes within the connective tissue.[2] (**Image.** Chronic Lung Abscess) ## History and Physical Early signs and symptoms of a lung abscess are similar to pneumonia and include fever, chills, cough, night sweats, dyspnea, weight loss, fatigue, chest pain, and occasionally anemia. Initially, the cough is nonproductive, but it becomes productive when bronchial communication develops, a hallmark sign of lung abscess. This productive cough may sometimes be accompanied by hemoptysis. Differential diagnoses for lung abscesses include conditions like cavitary tuberculosis and mycoses, although these rarely show the radiological sign of a gas-liquid level. Cavitating bronchial carcinomas (eg, squamous cell or small cell carcinomas) typically present with thicker, more irregular walls than infectious lung abscesses. The absence of fever, purulent sputum, and leukocytosis can suggest a carcinoma rather than an infectious disease. ## Evaluation Chest radiographs and CT aid in the diagnosis of a lung abscess. Differentiating between lung abscesses and pulmonary cystic lesions, including intrapulmonary bronchial cysts, sequestration, or secondary infected emphysematous bullae, can be challenging. However, the lesion's location and clinical signs often guide the diagnosis. Localized pleural empyema can be distinguished using a CT scan (**Image**. Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess) or ultrasound. The radiological sign of an air-fluid level can also be seen in hydatid cysts of the lung.[10] Sputum examination helps identify microbiological agents or confirm bronchial carcinoma. Microbiologic analysis of sputum can potentially assist in management. If the patient presents with risk factors for fungi or mycobacteria in their history, particular cultures should be requested.[11] Diagnostic bronchoscopy is crucial for obtaining material for microbiological examination and confirming an intrabronchial cause of the abscess, such as a tumor or foreign body. Pleural fluid analysis and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage also have been utilized in rare cases.[12] Lung abscesses are more prone to develop over the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and middle lobe followed by the superior segment of the right lower lobe and sometimes of the left lung in case of aspiration of oropharyngeal contents.[13] Complicated lung abscess can cause pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema. In such cases, pleural fluid analysis can aid in diagnosis. Lung abscesses in patients who are immunocompromised have an increased risk of complications. However, immunocompetent patients with adequate treatment have a decreased risk of complications and usually resolve in 3 weeks. Furthermore, in cases of lung abscesses
