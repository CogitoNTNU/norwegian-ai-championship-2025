presents with severe pain, fever, and dark, dusky skin with crepitus. The individual may show signs of septic shock. Aggressive resuscitation and immediate surgical debridement can be life-saving. **Musculoskeletal and Neurologic Sequelae** Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively common complication of opioid overdose that may occur even without compartment syndrome. Opioids are likewise known to increase the risk of seizures, particularly drugs like propoxyphene, meperidine, pentazocine, intravenous fentanyl, and heroin. The individual may present with a prolonged seizure, which may result from CNS hypoperfusion and hypoxia or from intracranial injury due to a fall. **Narcotic Bowel Syndrome** Narcotic bowel syndrome is a type of opiate-induced bowel pathology characterized by frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe abdominal pain that worsens with escalating or continued opiate doses. This syndrome typically occurs in individuals without prior bowel pathology and represents a maladaptive response. Narcotic bowel syndrome may also be associated with intermittent vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation. Eating tends to aggravate the symptoms, which can last for days or weeks. Anorexia may result in weight loss, and delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit are delayed. The syndrome is often mistaken for bowel obstruction. The key to diagnosis lies in recognizing that continued and escalating opiate doses worsen abdominal pain rather than provide relief. Treatment for narcotic bowel syndrome involves psychotherapy, as well as tapering or discontinuing the opioid. Successful treatment depends on developing a strong patient-physician relationship and trust, gradually withdrawing the narcotic, and using nonpharmacological treatments to manage pain. **Withdrawal Reaction** Withdrawal symptoms following cessation of opiates are common, but they are often vague and less severe than those observed with alcohol or benzodiazepine discontinuation. The onset of symptoms depends on the drug ingested, typically occurring within 2 to 4 days after methadone cessation and 8 to 10 hours after meperidine withdrawal. Autonomic symptoms may include excessive lacrimation, sweating, piloerection, rhinorrhea, repeated yawning, myalgia, nasal congestion, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms usually peak between 36 and 48 hours and gradually subside within 72 hours. Symptoms may last 7 to 14 days in chronic drug addicts. Treatment for withdrawal symptoms is supportive, and the use of additional opiates to counter withdrawal symptoms is not recommended. Clonidine may be used in severe withdrawal cases, especially when methadone is inappropriate or unavailable. After acute treatment, the patient should be referred to a long-term drug rehabilitation program to help prevent relapse. ## Deterrence and Patient Education In early 2015, the
