efficacy is limited. - Acute bone loss due to sudden immobilization: Calcitonin might aid in averting or mitigating the rapid loss of BMD that occurs when an individual becomes immobilized due to injury, surgery, or illness. ## Mechanism of Action Endogenous calcitonin is synthesized in the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, whereas exogenously administered calcitonin extract originates from the ultimobranchial gland of salmon. Salmon calcitonin is a 32-amino acid, alpha-helical polypeptide that differs significantly from human calcitonin, particularly in amino acids 10 to 27. These variations in the amino acid sequence account for the heightened potency observed in salmon-derived calcitonin.[19][20][21][22] Calcitonin functions through a G proteinâ€“coupled receptor, known as the calcitonin receptor, which predominantly transmits signals via the cAMP and PLC/IP3 pathways.[19][23] Calcitonin exerts its most significant physiological effects on osteoclasts and the tubular epithelium of kidneys, which hold clinical relevance. In the tubules, calcitonin induces diuresis and decreases reabsorption, reducing serum calcium and phosphate levels. In bone, calcitonin prompts osteoclast contraction, thereby diminishing their motility and capacity to resorb bone. Osteoclasts are recognized to undergo retraction and escape the sustained impacts of calcitonin administration within 24 to 48 hours, thereby reducing its long-term potency. Calcitonin also inhibits carbonic anhydrase II, disrupting the optimal acidic environment necessary for osteoclast activity. Furthermore, calcitonin hinders the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into their mature form.[19][20] This cumulative effect reduces bone matrix resorption and lowers serum calcium levels, albeit with diminishing efficacy over 1 to 2 days. **Pharmacokinetics** Absorption: Calcitonin is available in different formulations, including nasal spray and SQ and IM injections. The bioavailability of calcitonin varies depending on the route of administration. Intranasal administration leads to gradual absorption, with peak plasma concentrations attained within 15 to 40 minutes and a 3% bioavailability. SQ and IM injections yield peak plasma concentrations within 15 to 30 minutes and bioavailability of approximately 66%. Distribution: Calcitonin disperses throughout the body following its absorption. The drug exhibits a relatively short half-life, ranging from minutes to hours. Calcitonin readily attaches to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, at a rate of approximately 30% to 40%. The drug distributes across various body tissues, with the highest concentrations observed in the kidneys, bones, and central nervous system. In addition, calcitonin displays a volume of distribution ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 L/kg. Metabolism: The primary metabolic processes for calcitonin involve enzymatic breakdown by proteolytic enzymes, which predominantly occur in the
