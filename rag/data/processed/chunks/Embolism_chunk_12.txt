focus on supportive measures. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation \<90%. Mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but clinicians should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation. Acute right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over-distend the right ventricular, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output. Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC)/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors may be needed for hemodynamic support. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with PEs. **Anticoagulation** Remembering that anticoagulation is the mainstay of treating acute PE is vital. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; fondaparinux) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred since they lower the incidence of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.[65][66] UFH is usually only used in patients with hemodynamic instability in whom primary reperfusion treatment might be required or in patients with renal impairment. Newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) can also be used for anticoagulation in PE. **Anticoagulation and hemodynamic stability** The treatment for patients with suspected PE is stratified according to the type of PE (hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the clinician's suspicion index. Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE. Anticoagulation is started before diagnostic imaging is obtained for hemodynamically stable patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE. For hemodynamically stable patients with a low clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 24 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion of PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 4 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, IVC filter placement should be considered when the diagnosis of PE is confirmed. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE who are hemodynamically unstable, emergent CTPA, portable perfusion scanning, or bedside transthoracic echocardiography should be performed whenever possible. Primary reperfusion treatment, usually thrombolysis, is
