Unlike the more common calculous cholecystitis caused by gallstones, acalculous cholecystitis results from gallbladder stasis, cholestasis, and hypoperfusion, often due to prolonged fasting, total parenteral nutrition, or rapid weight loss. Due to its often vague presentation and rapid progression, acute acalculous cholecystitis poses significant diagnostic and management challenges. Common symptoms include right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and a positive Murphy's sign. Diagnosis may be challenging as patients often present with other severe conditions. This course explores the roles and responsibilities of the interprofessional team in optimizing patient-centered care, including ICU monitoring, supportive care, percutaneous drainage, antibiotic therapy, surgical interventions, and strategies to improve patient outcomes. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in identifying acute acalculous cholecystitis, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional approach when managing this condition to reduce morbidity and mortality while improving functional outcomes for this vulnerable patient population. **Objectives:** - Determine the risk factors associated with the development of acalculous cholecystitis. - Assess the clinical features of acalculous cholecystitis. - Implement the appropriate treatment approach for a patient with acalculous cholecystitis. - Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients with acalculous cholecystitis.

The most commonly encountered condition of cholecystitis is caused by a mechanical blockage of the gallbladder outlet at the cystic duct, typically due to the presence of a gallstone. Duncan first described the condition of acute acalculous cholecystitis in 1844. Although acalculous cholecystitis usually presents in the acute setting, chronic acalculous cholecystitis typically presents more insidiously. The condition is more common in critically ill patients in the intensive
