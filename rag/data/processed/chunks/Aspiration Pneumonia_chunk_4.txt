is suspected, obtaining a comprehensive history regarding current or previous dysphagia, instances of aspiration, coughing during eating or drinking, and other medical conditions predisposing to overt or silent aspiration aids in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia.[5] As outlined earlier, aspiration in patients with pneumonia does not unequivocally signify aspiration pneumonia. However, given the heightened frequency of aspiration events in older adults and the increased pneumonia risk in patients with dysphagia or microaspirations, the current recommendation is to regard aspiration pneumonia as the probable cause of pneumonia in elderly patients, and efforts should be made to evaluate and manage impaired swallowing thoroughly.[5] Conversely, a history of large-volume overt or witnessed aspiration event suggests aspiration pneumonitis rather than aspiration pneumonia.[1] In most cases, the onset of symptoms in aspiration pneumonia is acute. However, it may present subacutely due to less virulent bacteria. Clinical signs and symptoms commonly observed in patients with aspiration pneumonia include dyspnea, hypoxemia, and fever. One distinguishing feature of aspiration pneumonitis compared to aspiration pneumonia is the occurrence of hyperacute hypoxemia almost immediately in affected patients. This hyperacute hypoxemia can either progress to severe acute lung injury with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome or resolve entirely within 48 hours of onset.[4] During the initial evaluation, the clinical history should encompass inquiries regarding any episodes of decreased consciousness and swallowing difficulties. Assessing the swallowing efficacy of tablets, solids, and liquids is crucial, especially in older adults. Specific inquiries regarding prior occurrences of pneumonia and periodontal disease should be made. Additionally, obtaining a social history, including details about smoking and alcohol consumption, is imperative for identifying underlying risk factors for aspiration pneumonia.[1] During the physical examination, cognitive assessment should be conducted in older adults, mainly if there is no history of overt aspiration. Additionally, immediate evaluation for hypoxemia is essential to ensure prompt correction.[1] ## Evaluation The diagnostic workup recommended by the British Thoracic Society for evaluating patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia includes:[1] - Plain chest radiograph (CXR) - Computed tomography (CT) of the chest if CXR is inconclusive or if a CT is required to rule out other diagnoses (such as pulmonary embolism) - Microbiological evaluation of sputum and blood - Serum electrolytes, albumin, liver enzymes, and complete blood count - These tests are not diagnostic on their own but are recommended to aid in assessing the severity of the systemic response. - Additionally, some tests, such as albumin levels, can
