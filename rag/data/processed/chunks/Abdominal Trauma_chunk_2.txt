other cardiac view. See below 5\*\* _._ Normal Lung: \*\*Lung sliding back and forth is normally secondary to the normal anatomy of the parietal and visceral pleural movement. Also, the pleura moves with respect to the ribs and comet tail artifacts. Pneumothorax: With a pneumothorax, there is no lung sliding back and forth. One will note the pleura and ribs move together. There will be NO comet tail artifacts. **CARDIAC** **Subxiphoid four-chamber** Both the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized for anterior or posterior fluid in the pericardium. - Parasternal views should be attempted if the subxiphoid view is not adequate. - Both the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized. **Parasternal long axis (PSLA)** - Both the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized. - In the ideal plane, the mitral and aortic valves will be visible, as well as a long view of the left ventricle. **Parasternal short axis (PSSA)** - The left ventricle will appear as a ring, with the right ventricle more anterior. **Apical Four-chamber** - Though rarely useful in the emergency department, this view allows easy comparison of left and right ventricles. - All four chambers should be visible in this plan. ## Treatment / Management Treatment of patients with blunt abdominal injury requires the routine ABCs (Airway, Breathing, and Circulation). Once the airway is protected, it is mandatory to protect the cervical spine. After the primary survey is complete, patients who are hypotensive require aggressive fluid resuscitation. If hemodynamic instability persists, blood should be typed and crossed, but in the meantime, immediate transfusion with O negative blood can be done (O+ for males and women past childbearing years). All patients with blunt abdominal trauma who have signs of peritonitis, frank bleeding, or worsening of clinical signs require an immediate laparotomy. Non-surgical treatment in patients with blunt abdominal injury depends on the clinical features, hemodynamic stability, and results of the CT scan. Advances in angiography can now help control hemorrhage with the use of embolization therapy, which is more cost-effective than laparotomy. In general, the prognosis of patients with blunt abdominal trauma is good.
