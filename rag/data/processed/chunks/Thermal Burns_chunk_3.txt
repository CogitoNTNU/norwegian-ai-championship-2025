granulation tissue. If a full-thickness burn does not undergo surgery, it is healed by contracture. These burns never spontaneously heal. See **Image.** Thermal Burn, Third Degree. **Extension into deep tissues (fourth-degree):** These burns involve the underlying soft tissue, which may include muscle or bone. These injuries may be life-threatening and need to be treated immediately. ## Indications HBO is indicated for burns that extend into the dermis and beyond. Each case may vary, but if a patient has an inhalation injury, impaired wound healing, extensive edema, or a large area of skin involved, HBO therapy would be a good adjunctive therapy to add. If a patient has received a skin graft or flap, HBO has been shown to improve the success of graft placement.[6] ## Technique or Treatment If used, HBO treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the injury. Three treatments in the first 24 hours are suggested, and twice daily after that. Sessions are 90 minutes long at 2.0 ATA to 2.4 ATA and should be continued for 20 to 30 sessions, although the number of treatments depends on the clinical extent of the injury and response to treatment. Patients are monitored in the chamber with blood pressure (BP) cuffs approved to use in monoplace chambers. Ventilator support may be given in the chamber, which is common in patients who sustained an inhalation injury. Fluid management is crucial in burn patients and needs to be initiated before HBO therapy is started. Several liters of fluid may be needed in the acute phase of the injury, and pumps may be needed to overcome the chamber pressure during HBO treatments.[7] ## Complications Though hyperbaric therapy is generally well tolerated, it is important to consider potential complications that can arise in patients receiving treatment. Barotrauma to hollow organs of the body is the most frequent side effect for which patients should be carefully monitored. The most common barotraumatic injury is middle ear barotrauma, which includes middle ear effusions and tympanic membrane rupture, with an incidence of about 2%. This side effect can mitigated with careful patient instructions regarding autoinflation techniques during treatment.[8] Barotrauma can also involve the sinuses and is typically found in patients with upper respiratory infections or allergic rhinitis. Patients should be carefully screened for these preconditions and may even be given antihistamines or nasal decongestants to mitigate potential complications during therapy sessions.[8] Pulmonary barotrauma, though less
