should be used to avoid systemic hypoperfusion.[10] **Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy** Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (colloquially broken-heart syndrome) is an underrecognized cause of HF, which causes transient left-ventricular wall abnormalities that are not localized to a specific vascular territory. It has several proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms, including coronary vasospasm, microcirculatory dysfunction, and increased sympathetic nervous system activation. This condition is treated with medications typical for HF with the addition of antithrombotic medications in certain clinical situations with wall motion abnormalities. Recognized cases increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic.[11][12][13] **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of maternal mortality. During pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 20% to 30% due to increased heart rate and stroke volume. It presents with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction during late pregnancy, postpartum, or up to several months after delivery. There is likely an underlying genetic component, and it is more common in women with advanced maternal age, Black race, and multifetal pregnancies. If wall motion abnormalities are present, anticoagulation is essential due to the hypercoagulable state caused by pregnancy. Recovery is variable by global region and inversely correlates with lowered EF.[14] **Obesity** Obesity\*\*\*\* is a leading cause of CHF in patients younger than 40 years, according to the "Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity" (the CHARM study). The "obesity paradox" described elsewhere has significant study flaws and is derived from older data. Up to 10% of CHF cases are thought to be attributable to obesity alone. Patients with obesity are more likely to have HFpEF, possibly secondary to adipose-produced cytokines, eg, IL-1b, IL-8, and TNFÎ±. Adipose tissue also degrades natriuretic peptides.[15][16][17] **Tachycardia and arrhythmia** Tachycardia and arrhythmia can induce a low-output CHF state. Dilation of all cardiac chambers and preservation or thinning of biventricular wall thickness is usually noted. Electrophysiologic changes accompany this, including prolonged duration and decreased amplitude of action potentials in the myocytes. All of these factors induce the typical neurohormonal response causing CHF. With rate control, these changes are often reversible due to myocardial hibernation.[18] **Thyrotoxicosis** Thyrotoxicosis is a rare cause of HF despite initiating a hyperdynamic circulatory state. This may be partially due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, causing sodium and water retention, as well as upregulation of erythropoietin-stimulating agent, both of which will cause increased blood volume. Sustained tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation can also cause CHF.[19] **High-output cardiac failure** High-output
