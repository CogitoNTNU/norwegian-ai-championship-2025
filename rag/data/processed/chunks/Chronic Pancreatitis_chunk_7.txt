bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis when conservative therapy is ineffective [36] In severe cases, inpatient care may be necessary, particularly for patients with chronic pain and anorexia, often requiring narcotics and nutritional support. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation, typically taken with meals, may help reduce pain, although its effectiveness remains uncertain. **Management of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency** Chronic pancreatitis accompanied by weight loss, malnutrition, diarrhea, steatorrhea, osteopenia, or osteoporosis should raise suspicion of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is recommended for managing symptomatic exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The potential benefits of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy include improved symptoms, reduced morbidity related to maldigestion (especially bone fractures), better absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and trace elements, reduced fecal fat, weight gain, improved quality of life, and potentially lower mortality rates.[1] A reduced fecal elastase level is the accessible diagnostic test for moderate-to-severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Patients should avoid consuming a high-fiber diet (>25 g/d), as excessive fiber may interfere with enzyme activity. However, a low-fat diet is no longer recommended, as it may contribute to nutritional deficiencies. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be taken at the start of each meal or snack, with additional supplementation added during or after the meal if needed (see **Table 3.** Dosage of Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy). Failure to respond to maximal doses of PERT raises several considerations. To maintain effectiveness, capsules must be appropriately stored at temperatures below 25 °C or 77 °F and kept away from direct sunlight, cars, or heat sources. In addition, inadequate response may indicate the need for acid suppression therapy with a histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor. If symptoms persist despite these measures, an alternative cause should be considered.[37] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK482325/table/article-26580.table2/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK482325/table/article-26580.table2/?report=objectonly) Table 3. Dosage of Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy. Reference for the table.[37] ## Differential Diagnosis If symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency, such as diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatus, bloating, and abdominal pain, persist despite a dose of greater than 10,000 units of lipase/kg/d, several potential causes exist. These factors should be excluded before further increasing the pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy dose.[38] The differential diagnosis includes: - Small bowel malabsorption - Peptic ulcer disease - Cholelithiasis - Biliary obstruction - Acute pancreatitis - Pancreatic cancer - Pancreatic pseudocyst - Chronic mesenteric ischemia - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth - Enteric bacterial infection - Short bowel syndrome - Inflammatory bowel disease - Celiac disease - Lactose or other food intolerances - Bile
