pleural effusions, and contralateral supraclavicular and contralateral hilar involvement.[14] ## Prognosis **Prognosis of NSCLC** The TNM stage at presentation in patients with NSCLC has the most significant impact on prognosis. A higher TNM stage correlates with advanced disease and poor outcomes. Other factors indicative of poor prognosis include performance status at the time of diagnosis, anorexia, weight loss, and the presence of liver or skin metastases.[42] Molecular studies have revealed that patients with activating mutations of EGFR in patients with adenocarcinoma have a better prognosis than those without EGFR mutations.[43] **Prognosis of SCLC** The extent of disease and the stage at presentation is the most important prognostic factor for SCLC. Patients with the limited-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 10 to 13%, whereas patients with the extensive-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 1 to 2%.[44] Similar to NSCLC, performance status and weight loss are independent prognostic factors for SCLC, where patients with poor performance status and/or weight loss at the time of diagnosis have a decreased survival rate. ## Complications Complications of lung cancer such as thrombosis and paraneoplastic syndromes are discussed above. Common complications seen in patients undergoing treatment for lung cancer include: - Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting - Fatigue - Anorexia - Weight loss - Anemia - Neutropenia - Nephrotoxicity (especially in patients receiving cisplatin-based therapies) - Neurotoxicities ## Deterrence and Patient Education The single most important preventive measure is smoking cessation in all individuals. Patients should be advised about the clinical correlation of lung cancer with smoking at every clinician visit. Another important method of decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer is effective screening. A low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) is indicated for high-risk individuals for primary prevention. Smokers between the ages of 66 to 80 years benefit more from screening than those aged 55 to 64 years.[45] Patients without a history of smoking do not benefit from lung cancer screening. Multiple other models incorporating clinical factors such as a history of lung disease, family history of lung cancer, and asbestos exposure have been developed. They can be applied to determine at-risk individuals who may benefit from screening. Current guidelines by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (2021) recommend an annual LDCT for patients aged 50 to 80 years who are at high risk of lung cancer due to their smoking history.[46] High-risk individuals are defined as those who
