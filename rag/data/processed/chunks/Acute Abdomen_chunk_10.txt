by revealing air-fluid levels and distended bowel loops. Ultrasound effectively visualizes intussusception, whereas a contrast enema can diagnose and treat intussusception. An upper gastrointestinal contrast series remains the imaging study of choice for malrotation with volvulus. Children who present with classic signs of appendicitis should undergo evaluation by a pediatric surgeon before undergoing imaging. If the presentation is atypical or the examination findings are unclear, imaging with abdominal ultrasound is preferred. Children with suspected necrotizing enterocolitis should undergo abdominal radiographs, which reveal pneumatosis intestinalis. Some centers use ultrasonography, which shows free air, focal fluid collections, increased bowel wall thickness, and echogenicity.[[34]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173893#ref_23771727) Infants with necrotizing enterocolitis also warrant a sepsis evaluation, CBC, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose levels. Persistent hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis all indicate necrotic bowel and sepsis.[[35]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173893#ref_16567195) Clinicians can follow serum lactate levels to monitor disease progression and improvement. ## Treatment / Management Clinicians initiate resuscitation alongside the initial evaluation, not delaying specialty consultation while awaiting imaging results.[34] They promptly attach patients to a cardiac monitor and treat those with peritonitis, hypotension, or a toxic appearance by establishing large-bore IV access, administering crystalloid fluids, and using vasopressors for septic shock. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or chronic glucocorticoid use receive stress-dose steroids, and patients with evidence of hypovolemia and hemorrhage receive blood products. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic enteric organisms are necessary when infection, peritoneal contamination, or sepsis is suspected. Healthcare professionals should remember that adequate pain management is essential and does not alter the assessment.[35] Potential interventions include acetaminophen, parenteral ketorolac, and opioids. Clinicians must exercise caution with ketorolac, as it can exacerbate gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and acute kidney injury. The diagnosis dictates further intervention and specialty consultation. Typical specialty involvement includes general or vascular surgery, gynecology, interventional radiology, urology, and gastroenterology. Patients with suspected perforation and pneumoperitoneum on initial radiographs warrant immediate surgical referral. In addition, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, testicular torsion, ovarian torsion, an obstructing infected kidney stone, and a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm are some examples of conditions that warrant immediate specialty and surgical referral. ## Differential Diagnosis Although the majority of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have a benign underlying cause, the differential diagnosis is extensive, and clinicians must rely on an organized approach to determine which patients require immediate surgical intervention or medical therapy. The following list includes potential differential diagnoses for patients presenting with acute abdominal pain: - Abdominal
