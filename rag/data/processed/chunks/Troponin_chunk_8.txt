probably IgG, which showed a high affinity for cTnI and prevented its recognition by the two-site immunoassays used.[93] More recently, Eriksson and co-workers have suggested the incidence of falsely negative troponin values at low levels to be as high as 3.5%, as indicated by low cTnI recoveries of ≤ 10%. The major effect of this interfering factor occurred when troponin concentration was low. The identity of the interference is unknown but has a molecular weight of 100 to 200 kDa, suggesting it to be protein in nature.[94] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings The current (fourth) Universal Definition of MI Expert Consensus Document updates the definition of MI to accommodate the increased use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). Detection of an elevated cTn value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) is defined as myocardial injury.[95] The injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values.[15] **Type 1 Myocardial Infarction** The criteria for **type 1 MI** includes the detection of a rise, fall, or rise and fall of cTn with at least one value above the 99th percentile and with at least one of the following: 1. Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia 1. New ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes 1. Development of pathological Q waves 1. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology 1. Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography, including intracoronary imaging or by autopsy **Type 2 Myocardial Infarction** The criteria for **type 2 MI** includes detection of a rise, fall, or rise and fall of cTn with at least one value above the 99th percentile and evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to coronary thrombosis, requiring at least one of the following: 1. Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia 1. New ischemic ECG changes 1. Development of pathological Q waves 1. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology **Cardiac Procedural Myocardial Injury** Cardiac procedural myocardial injury is arbitrarily defined by increases in cTn values (>99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% of the baseline value when it is above the 99th percentile, but it is stable or falling. **Coronary Intervention-related Myocardial Infarction** Coronary intervention-related MI is
