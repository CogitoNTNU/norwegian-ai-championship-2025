Cardiomegaly - Hepatojugular reflex - Neck vein distention - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea - Pulmonary rales - Third heart sound (S3 Gallop) The minor criteria of HF include: - Ankle edema - Dyspnea on exertion - Hepatomegaly - Nocturnal cough - Pleural effusion - Tachycardia (heart rate >120 beats per minute) [37] ## Evaluation A comprehensive assessment is required when evaluating a patient with HF. This includes a complete blood count and iron, renal, and liver profiles. Patients require further investigations after the basic metabolic and blood panel, depending on the etiology and clinical stage.[1] **Laboratory Studies** Laboratory investigations recommended in patients with HF include: - **Complete blood count (CBC)** : A CBC may suggest anemia or leukocytosis suggestive of an infection triggering CHF. - **Renal profile** : A complete renal profile is necessary for all patients with HF. It indicates the degree of renal injury associated with HF and guides medication choice. Determining a patient's baseline renal function before initiating medications, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, or diuretics, is essential. Serum sodium level has prognostic value as a predictor of mortality in patients with chronic HF. "The Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure" (OPTIME-CHF) trial demonstrated a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as 30-day mortality in patients with HF who presented with hyponatremia.[39] - **Live enzymes** : An assessment of liver function is usually performed. Hepatic congestion secondary to HF may result in elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).[40] - **Urine studies** : Urine studies can be useful in diagnosis. If amyloidosis is suspected, urine and serum electrophoresis and monoclonal light chain assays should be performed. Bone scintigraphy can be performed if clinical suspicion is high despite negative testing for light chains.[1] - **Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** : BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-ProBNP) levels can aid in differentiating cardiac from noncardiac causes of dyspnea in patients with ambiguous presentations. BNP is an independent predictor of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and is used to assess mortality risk in patients with HF. BNP levels correlate with NYHA classification, and the utility is primarily used as a marker to evaluate treatment efficacy. NT-ProBNP is the chemically inert N-terminal fragment of BNP and has a longer half-life. The ratio of NT-ProBNP/BNP varies depending on underlying comorbidities and may be a useful
