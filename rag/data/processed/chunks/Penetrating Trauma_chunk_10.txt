they are generally well-tolerated. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy:** This therapy may be beneficial for AAT, particularly if corticosteroid therapy is ineffective. Treatment typically involves 120-minute dives to pressures ranging from 200 to 280 kPa daily for 10 days.[64][67][68][49][50] The AAOHNS guidelines on sudden sensorineural hearing loss indicate that if there is no response to initial therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with corticosteroids can serve as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset.[45] Temporary placement of ear ventilation tubes may also be necessary. In summary, key management factors include the prior use of HPDs, whether in a linear or nonlinear manner, and the initiation of early steroid treatment following an AAT injury, preferably within 24 to 72 hours.[64] Hearing recovery may vary based on age and comorbidities, necessitating individualized clinical treatment. Despite guideline recommendations, oral steroid treatment may be more favorable than transtympanic steroid injections and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in clinical practice. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses for AAT include: - Sudden sensorineural hearing loss - Head trauma causing inner ear, cochleovestibular nerve injury, or brainstem pathology - Stroke - posterior circulation cerebrovascular accident, typically characterized by sudden onset of hearing loss and frequently associated with other neurological deficits [69] - Viral infections (primarily) - Autoimmune diseases - Chemotherapy for cancer or infections - Neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis - Ménière disease ## Prognosis The time interval from AAT to triage, initial audiometry, and treatment by an otolaryngologist is crucial for improving prognosis, especially if steroid therapy is initiated. In a study involving 263 healthy participants, half received steroids, whereas the other half did not receive any treatment following AAT. Those treated within 24 hours with high-dose steroids for at least 7 days demonstrated significantly better hearing outcomes compared to the untreated group. The steroid-treated group experienced an average improvement of 13 to 14 dB in bone conduction thresholds at 3 and 4 kHz (_P_ = .001) and an additional 7 to 8 dB improvement in air conduction thresholds at 6 and 8 kHz compared to the untreated group (_P_ < .0001).[61] Patients exhibiting a threshold shift greater than 60 dB across three consecutive frequencies for 10 or more days after noise exposure are unlikely to resolve spontaneously and are at a higher risk of permanent hearing loss.[25] ## Complications The effects of loud noise exposure are pathological, psychological, and sociological. Hearing loss can impact interpersonal communication, leading to diminished self-esteem
