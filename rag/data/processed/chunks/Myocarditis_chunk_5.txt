from noninvasive testing. In asymptomatic individuals, at least 2 diagnostic criteria are required to establish the diagnosis. Clinical presentations may include chest pain, symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock. Diagnostic findings include electrocardiographic abnormalities, such as ST-T wave changes or PR segment depression (resembling pericarditis), ventricular arrhythmias, elevated cardiac biomarkers (such as troponin-I or creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB]), and left ventricular dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities that are not consistent with a coronary artery distribution on the echocardiogram. Additional supportive findings include a cardiac MRI consistent with the updated Lake Louise criteria and increased patchy or diffuse fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET), both of which are indicative of myocardial inflammation.[1] **Diagnostic Investigations for Myocarditis** The tests mentioned below are commonly used to evaluate patients with suspected myocarditis: **Complete blood count** CBC may reveal leukocytosis; eosinophilia can be seen in cases of eosinophilic myocarditis. **Inflammatory reactants** Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ILs, or IFNs, along with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), may indicate systemic inflammation associated with myocarditis. **Cardiac markers** Over half of patients with biopsy-confirmed myocarditis exhibit elevated troponin I or T levels, which have good specificity but limited sensitivity. Elevated levels of proâ€“B-type natriuretic peptide may also be present. **Electrocardiogram** ECG findings in acute myocarditis are often nonspecific and may include ST-segment changes, PR segment depression, and low voltage. Additional features can include sinus tachycardia, ventricular or bradyarrhythmias, and intraventricular conduction delays, signifying diseased myocardium. ECG changes may also suggest an acute coronary syndrome. Atrioventricular blocks can be present, and conduction system involvement raises the possibility of Lyme disease, giant cell myocarditis, or cardiac sarcoidosis. Diffuse ST elevation may occur in the presence of pericarditis. The sensitivity of ECG for diagnosing acute myocarditis is 47%. **Chest radiograph** Although not sensitive or specific for myocarditis, chest radiographs may reveal indirect signs such as cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. **Echocardiogram** Echocardiography is a widely accessible bedside tool used to assess myocardial function, determine the degree of myocardial damage, and detect coexisting conditions such as valvular heart disease or intracardiac thrombus. Key findings may include reduced left ventricular systolic function, ventricular dilatation, an increased sphericity index, diastolic dysfunction, and pericardial effusion when present. Global longitudinal strain is typically reduced, offering additional diagnostic value. In fulminant myocarditis, ventricular dimensions are often preserved while septal thickness increases, indicating myocardial edema. In contrast, acute
