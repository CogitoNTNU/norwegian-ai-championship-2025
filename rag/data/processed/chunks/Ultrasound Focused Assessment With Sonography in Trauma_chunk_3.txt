anesthesia can be a better option to avoid airway manipulation when appropriate. Involving expert team members is essential to patient safety. Having an experienced pediatric anesthesia provider manage the airway has been shown to reduce the risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events for children.[14] Patients with uncontrolled asthma have a higher risk of postoperative mortality and pneumonia. A preoperative assessment, including a detailed history, medication evaluation, and possibly pulmonary function tests, is essential when assessing patients with asthma before surgery. By optimizing medical management and using appropriate anesthetic techniques, healthcare professionals can minimize perioperative respiratory complications.[4] **Preoperative Medications** Other than theophylline, patients should continue their maintenance medications during the entire perioperative period, including the day of surgery. Patients with poorly controlled symptoms scheduled to undergo thoracic or upper abdominal surgery, open aortic aneurysm repair, neurosurgery, or head and neck surgeries generally receive a 5-day course of oral glucocorticoids and short-acting bronchodilators. In addition, short-acting bronchodilators are often administered shortly before anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The anesthesia team must carefully administer warm and humidified gases, achieve appropriate anesthesia depth, and monitor airway management during surgery. Patients with bronchorrhea can receive a combination of a nebulized anticholinergic agent and a moderate-acting ß2-agonist, such as ipratropium bromide-salbutamol. Postoperative care involves monitoring oxygen levels, providing adequate hydration and analgesia, and correctly prescribing the patient's usual asthma medications. For patients with well-controlled asthma, routine mechanical ventilation is generally suitable. However, when airflow obstruction is present, prolonged expiratory phases can pose challenges. To prevent dynamic hyperinflation, also known as auto-PEEP or breath-stacking, clinicians must ensure sufficient time for exhalation during mechanical ventilation. **Anesthesia Agents** When anesthesia providers plan for endotracheal intubation, experts recommend a variety of pharmacological agents for premedication, a primary induction agent, and a neuromuscular-blocking agent. Adjunctive medications for premedications include an opioid-like fentanyl, lidocaine, or the α2-agonist dexmedetomidine. Guidelines suggest different induction agents, including propofol, ketamine, etomidate, isoflurane, and sevoflurane, for patients with asthma undergoing surgery based on their stability and bronchodilatory properties. Induction agents must induce sufficient anesthesia to prevent a physiological response to airway manipulation. Propofol is often the primary agent selected in hemodynamically stable patients. Neuromuscular-blocking agents are the most common cause of intraoperative allergic reactions. As they release the least amount of histamine, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium are the neuromuscular-blocking agents of choice for patients with asthma. The volatile anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane are viable options for inhaled anesthesia
