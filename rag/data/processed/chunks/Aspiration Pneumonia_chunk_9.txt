CAP without risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa,_ compared to hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP without these risk factors, is that the former cannot be treated with fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline combination therapy. These regimens have not been studied extensively in this population and are therefore not recommended as empiric therapy for adults with severe CAP.[8] Patients recently hospitalized (within the last 90 days for at least 5 days), received parenteral antibiotics, and validated risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa,_ should receive empiric coverage for these organisms only if they have severe CAP on presentation. Nonsevere pneumonia in these patients may be treated with the above regimens, with specific testing to rule out these infections. However, if patients with CAP have previously been infected or colonized with either of these organisms, they should receive empiric coverage regardless of the severity of the pneumonia. MRSA and _P aeruginosa_ coverage may be subsequently discontinued if culture or nasal testing does not isolate these organisms.[8] In patients with validated risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa_ or a prior history of infections secondary to these organisms, treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem is required, in combination with vancomycin or linezolid.[6] A minimum of 5 days of therapy is required for the treatment.[6][8] Longer durations may be considered for patients with slow clinical response, necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, or empyema.[6] Dedicated anaerobic coverage is not advised in patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. While patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia and accompanying lung abscesses or empyema may be considered for anaerobic coverage, it is essential to note that there is very low-quality evidence supporting this recommendation.[8] Of particular concern is the use of clindamycin to cover for anaerobes, as it increases the risk for _Clostridium difficile_ colitis. Clinical data shows no significant difference between ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, and carbapenems for treating suspected aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, moxifloxacin has demonstrated similar efficacy in treating aspiration pneumonia compared to ampicillin/sulbactam, with a clinical response rate of 66.7%.[6] Clindamycin is recommended only as additional therapy to provide better anaerobic coverage in patients with a high risk of predominantly anaerobic infection, such as those with severe periodontal disease coupled with necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscesses.[6] However, its use should be carefully considered due to the associated risk of _C_ _difficile_ colitis. Therapy with glucocorticoids has been extensively studied in patients with aspiration syndromes, but their use has
