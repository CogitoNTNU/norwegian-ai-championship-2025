than lactate.[14] The subunit composition of the LDH enzyme (H and M subunits) varies among tissues (mentioned previously in the 'cellular' section). This variation is due to the difference in the metabolic rates, energy needs, and function of the tissues, which reflects in their LDHA: LDHB ratio. Almost 40% of lactate in the circulation is released from the skeletal muscle. This lactate is further absorbed mostly by the liver and kidney, where it undergoes oxidation for the synthesis of glucose. In the brain, about 10% of the lactate oxidizes to fuel 8% of cerebral energy needs during resting conditions, and the remaining lactate is released in circulation.[14][15] However, hyperlactatemia and physical exertion can lead to the uptake of lactate, which supports 60% of brain metabolism, with the contribution of cerebral lactate oxidation only up to 33%. In cancer cells, the function of LDH, specifically LDHA, is modified as compared to the normal cells. Cancer cells employ LDH to increase their aerobic metabolism (glycolysis and ATP production, and lactate production) even in the presence of oxygen. This process is known as the Warburg effect. The abnormal cancer cells benefit from switching to anaerobic metabolic phenotype by avoiding the generation of oxidative stress by the ETC. Additionally, the cancer cells also gain access to the metabolic intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generated through glucose and pyruvate, to synthesize lipids and nucleic acid for rapid cell proliferation.[16][17] ## Mechanism LDH catalyzes the synchronized inter-conversion of pyruvate to lactate and NADH to NAD+ and increases the speed of reaction by 14 times. The chemical reaction proceeds by transferring a hydride ion from NADH to pyruvate at its C2 carbon. The molecular mechanism involves the binding of NADH to the enzymes as a first step. Many residues at the active site are involved in this binding. Once NADH is bound, it facilitates the binding of lactate, through an interaction between the NADH ring and the LDH residues. Transfer of a hydride quickly occurs in both directions forming two tertiary complexes, namely, LDH-NAD+-lactate and LDH-NADH-pyruvate.[18] Subsequently, pyruvate Is dissociated from the enzyme first, and then NAD+ is released. The rate of dissociation of NADH and NAD+ proves to be the rate-limiting step in this reaction, and the final conversion of pyruvate to lactate leading to the regeneration of NAD+ is thermodynamically favored in the reaction.[19] **Enzyme regulation:** LDH activity is dependant on the metabolic switch
