children than adults.[2] In the US, the overall incidence is estimated to be 11 cases per 100,000 people per year, with a rate of 7.5 cases per 100,000 adults, and found to be 3 times more common in males than females, without any particular age or racial predilection.[2] Aseptic meningitis leads to 26,000 to 42,000 hospitalizations annually in the US.[2] Studies in Europe have indicated an incidence rate of 70 per 100,000 among children younger than 1 year, 5.2 per 100,000 among children 1 to 14, and 7.6 per 100,000 in adults.[8] In a study conducted in South Korea involving children, the incidence of aseptic meningitis showed a relatively even distribution across age groups, with higher rates observed in children under 1 year and those aged 4 to 7. The male-to-female ratio was 2 to 1 in this population.[13] Although aseptic meningitis can occur throughout the year, there are distinct peak periods, particularly during the summer months in temperate climates, when the incidence is notably higher.[2][8][13] ## History and Physical No aspect of the clinical history possesses sufficient sensitivity or specificity to establish a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, a thorough patient history is crucial, given the broad range of potential causes. The history should encompass inquiries about exposure to sick contacts, recent travel, substance use, sexual history, preceding or concurrent infections, and recent medication use, considering the possibility of drug-induced aseptic meningitis.[2][7] When assessing patients clinically, it is crucial to recognize the differences in how children and adults may manifest symptoms. Adults often report symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, stiff neck, and photophobia.[2][7] Unlike bacterial meningitis, the onset may be less acute, and altered mental status is not a common presentation. In contrast, children exhibit less specific symptoms, including fever, concurrent respiratory issues, rash, and irritability.[2][7] Neonates and infants less than 3 months of age may display a bulging anterior fontanelle and irritability as notable signs.[2] Specific factors like premature birth, maternal illness, elevated serum WBC count, low hemoglobin levels (\<10.7 mg/dL), and the onset of symptoms within the first week of life necessitate a prompt and thorough evaluation and management approach in neonates.[2][14] Nuchal rigidity (with a sensitivity of 70%) and fever (sensitivity of 85%) are prevalent physical signs observed in children and adults. Kernig and Brudzinski's signs, while highly specific at 95%, have limited utility due to their low sensitivity of 5%. Depending on the underlying
