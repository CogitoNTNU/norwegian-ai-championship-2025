included myometrial or scar tissue villous invasion with minimal decidua.[5] The depth of implantation determines the type of cesarean scar pregnancy, with type 1 having proximity to the uterine wall and type 2 implanting closer to the urinary bladder.[12] ## History and Physical **Clinical History** Ectopic pregnancies within the adnexa typically present with variable pain that typically starts as colicky abdominal or pelvic discomfort, often localized to one side, though clinicians should be aware that not all ectopic pregnancies have this characteristic presentation. For tubal ectopic pregnancies, as the fallopian tube distends, the pain may become more generalized if rupture and hemoperitoneum occur. Additional symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, nausea and vomiting, shoulder pain, urinary symptoms, or rectal pressure.[1] Therefore, women of childbearing age presenting with these symptoms should be evaluated.[6] Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies can range from asymptomatic presentations during routine obstetrical ultrasound to uterine rupture.[5] Clinicians should also identify the patient's last menstrual period and whether they have monthly routine menstrual periods. A missed last period, abnormal uterine bleeding, or sexual activity are suggestive of a possible pregnancy and, therefore, are also indications for further testing with a pregnancy test.[6] Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy should also be obtained in the clinical history.[13] **Physical Examination** After obtaining a thorough history, an attentive physical exam should be performed to help guide further diagnostic testing. Evaluation of vital signs for tachycardia and hypotension is pivotal in determining the patient's hemodynamic stability.[1] When examining the abdomen and suprapubic regions, attention should focus on the location of tenderness and any exacerbating factors. If voluntary or involuntary guarding of the abdominal musculature is elicited on palpation, possible free fluid suggestive of ruptured ectopic or peritonitis etiologies should be considered.[6] Palpating a gravid uterus may suggest an intrauterine pregnancy; however, this does not exclude an ectopic or heterotopic pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding should be assessed with a pelvic examination in addition to evaluating for cervical abnormalities, cervical os dilation, visible products of conception, and signs of infection. Bimanual pelvic exams additionally allow for palpation of bilateral adnexa to assess for abnormal masses or elicit adnexal tenderness.[1] ## Evaluation **Diagnostic Evaluation of Ectopic Pregnancy** The diagnostic evaluation of ectopic pregnancy primarily relies on the assessment of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) levels in conjunction with imaging modalities such as transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS). Among these, TVUS has been demonstrated to be the most
