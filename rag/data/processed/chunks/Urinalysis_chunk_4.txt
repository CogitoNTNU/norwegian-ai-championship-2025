serum creatinine levels may not reflect renal impairment until it has advanced significantly. In some studies, renal function can decrease by up to 50% before a rise in serum creatinine is detected.[19] Medications commonly affecting urine metanephrine levels are listed in the **Specimen Requirements and Procedure** section. ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings The components of 24-hour urine tests vary by laboratory, but standard analyses typically include urine volume, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid concentrations, pH levels, and supersaturation values. Supersaturation levels for calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid are commonly reported. Additional analytes may include sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, ammonium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrogen (in the form of urea). Reports usually provide reference range values to help assess the risk of stone formation. Specialized testing is available for pediatric individuals and those with cystinuria, which includes measuring cystine excretion, supersaturation, and urine pH. Since urine chemistry is a continuous variable, strict cut-off points for abnormal values are somewhat arbitrary. As urinary constituents deviate from normal or optimal ranges, the risk of stone formation increases. Below is a summary of the key components of the 24-hour urinalysis and their clinical significance. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/40765)," for more information. **Light-Chain Proteinuria** Light chains, such as Bence-Jones proteins, are used as markers for conditions such as multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and other monoclonal gammopathies affecting the kidneys. Under normal circumstances, these proteins are undetectable in urine, so any positive finding in a 24-hour urine collection is considered abnormal. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Bence-Jones Protein](/pubmed/31082079)" and "[Multiple Myeloma](/pubmed/30521185)," for more information. **Calcium** Elevated urinary calcium levels are found in over a third of patients with calcific stones. Urine calcium concentration is influenced by dietary calcium, sodium, and protein intake, medical comorbidities, kidney function, hormonal influences, and, in some cases, genetic conditions. A moderate calcium intake is recommended to limit excessive urinary calcium excretion, support bone health, and prevent increased oxalate absorption due to reduced intestinal oxalate binding. A very low calcium diet reduces the intestinal binding of oxalate, leading to increased oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria, which significantly promotes calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis formation.

Depending on the underlying etiology, urinary calcium modulation is typically achieved through dietary adjustments or medications such as thiazides. Optimal urinary calcium levels
