atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin as monotherapy. Even though the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is very low with statin use, in clinical practice, muscle-related side effects are a frequent cause for discontinuation of statin therapy. Use of the lowest tolerable statin dose is recommended in patients with a history of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis.[24][25] **Drug Intoxication** Intoxicants can cause rhabdomyolysis via various mechanisms. Cocaine is a well-known instigator of rhabdomyolysis. The mechanisms involve increased sympathetic stimulation of alpha receptors in the vasculature, increased endothelin production, and decreased nitrous oxide concentrations. Cocaine is also thrombogenic, as it activates platelets and inhibits plasminogen.[26] One study found the highest incidence of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis in those who used heroin intravenously, thought to be from local mechanical trauma from injection, with possible immune mechanisms contributing. Amphetamines also have a high rate of rhabdomyolysis, thought to be due to hyperthermia caused by amphetamine's effects on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Alcohol, opiates, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines may cause mechanical trauma from lying in one position for an extended period while intoxicated.[17] Withdrawal from opioids and baclofen (particularly intrathecal baclofen) has also been associated with rhabdomyolysis.[27][28] Patients with alcohol misuse disorder often have rhabdomyolysis related to direct muscle toxicity of alcohol as well as other insults, such as hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.[29] **Intensive Care Admission** Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also highly correlated with rhabdomyolysis.[2][18] ICU patients are severely ill, on multiple medications, and prone to electrolyte abnormalities; all of these factors predispose to rhabdomyolysis.[30] In addition, patients who are ventilated often receive propofol, and propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) must be considered. PRIS is a manifestation of propofol toxicity, which is thought to result in uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This results in metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse.[2] Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "[Propofol Toxicity,](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/301)" for further information **Congenital Myopathies** The number of congenital myopathies that can cause rhabdomyolysis is too numerous to list. Some common congenital myopathies that are known to cause rhabdomyolysis include: Disorders of glycogenolysis: myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphorylase kinase deficiency Disorders of glycolysis: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, mutase, and lactate dehydrogenase deficiencies Disorders of purine metabolism: myoadenylate deaminase deficiency Disorders of lipid metabolism: carnitine and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies, short- or long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, lipin-1 deficiency, and Brody myopathy (calcium adenosine triphosphatase [CAT] deficiency) [31] In addition, patients may not have any baseline CPK elevations but may
