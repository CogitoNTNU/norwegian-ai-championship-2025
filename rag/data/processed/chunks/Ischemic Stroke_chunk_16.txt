statins if they were on them before the ischemic stroke.[67] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke includes the following: - Complicated migraine - Drug toxicity - Intracranial abscess - Intracranial hemorrhage - Intracranial tumor - Hyperglycemia - Hypoglycemia - Hypertensive encephalopathy - Metabolic abnormalities - Movement disorders - Multiple sclerosis - Seizure - Sepsis - Syncope - Wernicke encephalopathy ## Prognosis Prognosis in stroke is pivotal in guiding treatment decisions and informing patients and caregivers about potential outcomes. The prognosis involves assessing various factors such as the type of stroke, its severity, the extent of neurological deficits, comorbidities, and response to treatment. Predictive tools, including clinical scales and imaging modalities, aid in predicting outcomes like functional impairment, mortality, and risk of recurrence (see **Image.** Encephalomalacia Following Ischemic Stroke). Early intervention and rehabilitation significantly influence prognosis, highlighting the importance of prompt medical attention and personalized care. While some individuals may achieve full recovery, others might experience long-term disabilities or complications. The prognosis in stroke emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary approaches, ongoing monitoring, and support to optimize outcomes and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals and their families.[68][69] ## Complications The complications of acute ischemic stroke are many and common.[70] These include but are not limited to the following: - DVT and pulmonary embolism: DVT prophylaxis is indicated. - Aspiration and pneumonia: A swallowing evaluation before feeding is always indicated and is part of stroke center accreditation. - Seizures - Depression - Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Early rehabilitation for stroke patients is beneficial, although very early rehabilitation, within 24 hours, should be avoided. The AVERT trial randomized patients to receive very early rehabilitation within 24 hours of stroke compared to usual stroke-unit care, and early mobilization demonstrated less favorable outcomes using the modified Rankin score.[71] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Deterrence and prevention strategies play a vital role in reducing the incidence and impact of ischemic stroke. By addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking through lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, individuals can significantly decrease their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Additionally, raising awareness about the warning signs of stroke and promoting timely access to medical care for symptoms such as sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking can expedite treatment and minimize damage.
