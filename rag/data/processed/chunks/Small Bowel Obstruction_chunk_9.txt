this can be seen. - Signs of perforation - Free air or fluid in the abdomen can indicate perforation. - Absence of contrast in bowel - In cases of a complete obstruction, contrast may not reach beyond the obstruction site. **Ultrasound** Although not typically the first choice for diagnosing SBO, abdominal ultrasound can be useful, particularly in children and pregnant women, due to its noninvasive nature. Additionally, ultrasound does not result in radiation exposure and has the benefit of rapid and serial examinations.[24][25] This study can detect bowel distention, peristalsis, and the presence of fluid or air in the bowel, and is often used in cases of suspected bowel perforation or other intraabdominal pathology. The following are pathological findings that can be seen on ultrasound: - A dilated small bowel loop measuring more than 3 cm in diameter suggests an obstruction or ileus. - An edematous bowel wall measuring more than 3 mm indicates an obstruction or other intestinal inflammatory cause. - The noncompressibility of the bowel and the appearance of free fluid suggest obstruction. - Anterograde-retrograde peristalsis is specific for obstruction. - The visualization of a transition point is specific for obstruction. A transition point on ultrasound is demonstrated by a thick-walled, noncompressible bowel loop adjacent to a loop of decompressed small bowel.[26] Ultrasound does not replace a CT scan and should not delay surgical consultation. This study is useful in cases where it can facilitate diagnostic evaluation and rule out other causes.[27] **Contrast Studies** If the diagnosis remains unclear, a contrast-enhanced study may be performed: - Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through - This is useful if there is a suspicion of a partial obstruction or when evaluating the motility of the bowel. - Barium enema - This is rarely used in acute SBO but can help visualize obstruction in the colon or ileocecal valve. **Other Diagnostic Tests** - Endoscopy - In some cases, especially if there is a concern for a nonmechanical cause such as a malignancy, endoscopic evaluation (eg, upper endoscopy or colonoscopy) may be performed. This is particularly useful for evaluating patients suspected of tumors or foreign bodies causing the obstruction. - Diagnostic laparoscopy - In cases where the etiology of the SBO is unclear or there is a suspicion of strangulation, peritonitis, or ischemia, diagnostic laparoscopy may be employed. This minimally invasive operation allows direct visualization of the abdominal cavity, aiding in the
