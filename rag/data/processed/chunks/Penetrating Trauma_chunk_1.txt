Introduction The human ear functions as a biological pressure transducer. Noise exposure is a significant global health issue, with approximately 5% of hearing loss in the worldwide population attributed to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).[1] Perception of loudness varies based on individual sensitivity to noise and is influenced by the below-mentioned 3 key aspects of sound. - Sound pressure level (acoustic pressure level): This logarithmic measure quantifies the effective pressure of sound relative to a reference level, expressed in decibels (dB). Examples are provided below.[2] - Party balloon rupture or jet engine: 150 dB. - Loudest human voice: 135 dB. - Typical pain threshold: 120 dB. - Hearing damage from long-term exposure (not necessarily continuous): 85 dB. - Frequency content. - Duration of sound.[3] Most individuals with normal hearing are particularly sensitive to sounds in the 2 to 4 kHz range, which corresponds to high-intensity impulse noises such as blasts. Human voices have fundamental frequencies, which represent the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform or the pitch in music, ranging from 90 to 155 Hz for males and 165 to 255 Hz for females. The sensitivity of the human ear varies based on perceived loudness at different frequencies. A lesser-known subtype of NIHL is acute acoustic trauma (AAT), defined by sudden sensorineural hearing loss resulting from exposure to intense impulse noise, such as blasts or gunshots. This occurs when noise levels exceed the elastic limits of the auditory system, typically exceeding 140 dB for less than 0.2 seconds. In contrast, NIHL generally develops after prolonged exposure—lasting several minutes to hours—to intense sounds in the 100 to 120 dBA range, commonly found in workplaces or combat zones.[4] AAT and NIHL often occur concurrently. AAT often results from mechanical and metabolic injuries to the auditory system, causing symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, otalgia, ear fluttering, pain, vertigo, and hyperacusis. Characteristic audiometric findings can be observed following AAT, and prompt recognition and referral to otolaryngology may help prevent permanent hearing impairment.[5][6] Despite its distinct history and audiometric profile, AAT has not garnered as much research attention in the literature as NIHL. Additionally, patient awareness and urgency in seeking treatment for AAT are often low. Many individuals underreport AAT or continue to expose themselves to further trauma due to their responsibilities and circumstances, particularly in military settings. A retrospective study revealed that relatively few patients report symptoms immediately after the trauma, with most incidents
