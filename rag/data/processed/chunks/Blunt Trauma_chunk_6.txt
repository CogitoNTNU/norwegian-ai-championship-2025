by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve.[35] AAT causes hypercontraction of the tensor tympani muscle, likely leading to muscle strain, fatigue, or overload.[36] Some authors have compared tensor tympani hypercontraction to a myofascial trigger point or a "micro-cramp."[37] Tensor tympani hypercontraction may be severe and could explain the fluttering sensation experienced in AAT.[38] Prolonged contraction, or muscle overload, can result in injury to the tensor tympani, with the following proposed consequences:[39] - Compression of blood vessels reduces oxygen supply. - Production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decreases. - The body shifts to anaerobic glycolysis, leading to lactic acid production and decreased pH.[40] - Mastocyte migration occurs, resulting in the release of histamine and platelet-activating factors, which triggers serotonin release from platelets and the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin geneâ€“related peptide.[41] - The prolonged, intense inflammatory response in the middle ear mucosa may extend across the round window, leading to inner ear damage.[42] Referred pain from AAT may arise from tensor tympani injury, chronic inflammation, and neural hyperactivity in the trigeminal pathways.[38] Otalgia related to AAT is likely due to motor and autonomic reflexes.[43] The origin of tinnitus associated with AAT remains unclear.[38] In addition to its direct effects on the auditory system, noise can induce psychological and physiological stress. The sensitivity of the auditory system can be modulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which may be activated by acoustic stress.[44] ## History and Physical Critical information in the medical history of a patient with suspected AAT includes the type, intensity, duration, and characteristics of exposure to brief, intense noise, as well as the severity and duration of the resulting sudden hearing loss. Accompanying symptoms, such as tinnitus and dizziness, should also be documented. In some cases, a condition known as acoustic shock may occur, characterized by symptoms like pain in and around the ear, tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear fullness and tension, and dizziness.[39] The physical examination for patients with AAT may be more crucial than for those with NIHL, as patients with prolonged noise exposure may show no physical findings. Detailed otomicroscopy is essential in AAT cases to assess any trauma to the ear canal, tympanic membrane, or ossicles. If the AAT resulted from a blast injury, any debris should be removed from the ear canal, and topical fluoroquinolone and steroid-containing ear drops should be prescribed. Topical drops containing aminoglycosides, such as neomycin, should be avoided to prevent
