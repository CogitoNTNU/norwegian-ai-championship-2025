noise reduction across different frequencies and intensities. - Feature a narrow inner channel along the earplug’s length, causing acoustic impedance to increase nonlinearly with external sound. - Nonlinear HPDs reduce harmful impulse noise while allowing speech and softer sounds to remain audible for communication and safety. **Active Hearing Protection Devices** Active HPDs work differently, using noise reduction algorithms within electronic devices to cancel noise actively. These devices optimize the signal-to-noise ratio to enhance the desired result, such as speech and communication amid noisy environments. These devices combine passive components, such as physical barriers, with active elements, such as preamplifiers and microphones. Some models also feature external signal processors, operating switches, and volume controls for added functionality. Active HPDs feature directional microphones that enhance communication and hearing protection. However, they can impair sound localization, particularly from behind—referred to as a soldier’s “6” in combat. The impact of blast-type noises varies based on proximity, device type, and whether the environment is open or enclosed. Diagnosing hearing loss from AAT requires audiological evaluation and access to high-quality equipment. Advances in technology, such as smartphone screening apps and audiometric headsets, may enhance future diagnostic capabilities. Patients with suspected AAT presenting with symptoms such as acute tinnitus, muffled hearing, or ear fullness should undergo a comprehensive head and neck examination, including a detailed otologic evaluation, ideally with otomicroscopy. Audiometric testing is the primary diagnostic tool and should be performed if hearing loss persists beyond 72 hours. Cortical evoked response audiometry may be indicated for patients suspected of exaggerating their hearing loss.[14] Further noise exposure should be avoided, especially if vertigo accompanies the hearing loss, to prevent risks during activities like driving or operating heavy machinery. Absolute indications for otolaryngology referral include suspected temporal bone fracture, tympanic membrane perforation, persistent clear or discolored ear drainage that does not resolve within a few days, facial nerve paralysis, and hearing loss in a patient with a single functional ear. The most significant challenges in AAT include the following: - Accurate diagnosis - Delays in seeking medical care (underreporting) - Repeat acoustic trauma - Blast-type noise - Concomitant prolonged noise exposure Management of AAT should be personalized and initiated promptly. Treatment outcomes and prognosis vary, and patients should be informed that hearing recovery remains unpredictable, regardless of intervention. ## Etiology Noise from loud explosions can damage the inner ear by overstimulating the auditory nerve fibers that relay sound information
