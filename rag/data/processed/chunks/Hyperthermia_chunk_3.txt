site will mitigate this risk.[5][6][7][8] ## Clinical Significance Decreasing core body temperature is the most critical intervention in managing heat-related illness and heat stroke. Cooling may also be an adjunct to the usual therapies for numerous conditions that may cause secondary hyperthermia. The techniques described are easy, simple, and effective ways of cooling a patient in the emergency department. They require little training and can be performed by an individual provider. Additionally, they are applicable in many environments. Rapidly identifying patients benefitting from this intervention is the key to effective management.[9][10] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Hyperthermia is not an uncommon presentation to the emergency room. Some of these patients may require systemic cooling to prevent neurological damage. Decreasing core body temperature is the most critical intervention in managing heat-related illness and heat stroke. The cooling is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, emergency department physician, and ICU nurses Cooling may also be an adjunct to the usual therapies for numerous conditions that may cause secondary hyperthermia. Rapidly identifying patients benefitting from this intervention is the key to effective management.[9][10] The outcomes in most patients who are promptly treated are good. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19961&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19961) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/therapeutics/cooling-techniques-for-hyperthermia-cooling-therapy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19961) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19961/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19961) [![Image ](/books/NBK459311/bin/Cooling_Techniques_For_Hyperthermia_-01.gif)](/books/NBK459311/figure/article-19961.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459311/figure/article-19961.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Cooling Techniques for Hyperthermia Graphic by E Gregory ## References 1.
