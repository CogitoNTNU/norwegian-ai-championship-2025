resistance that is present when a saline solution is injected into the compartment. Another method employs a slit catheter, whereby a catheter is placed within the compartment, and the pressure is measured with an arterial line transducer. The slit catheter method is more accurate and allows for continuous monitoring. Its use is also recommended to measure all the surrounding compartments. - The normal pressure within the compartment is between 0 mmHg to 8 mmHg. - An **intra-compartmental pressure greater than 30 mmHg indicates compartment syndrome** **and a need for fasciotomy.**[21] - When intra-compartmental pressure increases to within 10 mmHg to 30 mmHg of the patient's diastolic blood pressure, this indicates inadequate perfusion and relative ischemia of the involved extremity. - The perfusion pressure \_\_ of a compartment, also known as the compartment **delta pressure** , is defined as the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the intra-compartmental pressure: - delta pressure = diastolic pressure - measured intracompartmental pressure - clinicians often utilize delta pressure less than or equal to 30 mmHg as indicative of the need for fasciotomy. - Ultrasound with Doppler can be used to look for occlusion or thrombus. - Elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) may suggest muscle breakdown from ischemia, damage, or rhabdomyolysis. - If rhabdomyolysis is being considered, renal function tests, urine myoglobin, and urinalysis should be done. - If rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed, a chemistry panel is needed. - Preoperative studies should, at a minimum, include a complete blood count and coagulation studies. [22][23][24][25] ## Treatment / Management Acute compartment syndrome is an emergency condition. Less time should be spent on confirmation of the diagnosis, as delayed treatment may result in loss of limb.[26] - Immediate**surgical consult** - Provide supplemental oxygen. - Remove any restrictive casts, dressings, or bandages to relieve pressure. - Keep the extremity at the level of the heart to prevent hypo-perfusion. - Prevent hypotension and provide blood pressure support in patients with hypotension. - If**ICP is greater than or equal to 30 mmHg** or**delta pressure is less than or equal to 30 mmHg, fasciotomy should be done**. For patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for acute compartment syndrome but who are at high risk based on history and physical exam findings, or for patients with intracompartmental pressures between 15 to 20 mmHg, serial intracompartmental pressure measurements are recommended. Patients with ICPs between 20-30 mmHg should be admitted and the surgical
