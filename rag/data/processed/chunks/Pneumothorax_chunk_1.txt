in young, tall, thin males with subclinical pleural blebs. In contrast, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with preexisting lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary fibrosis. Traumatic pneumothorax occurs due to blunt or penetrating chest trauma, including rib fractures, gunshot wounds, or iatrogenic causes, such as lung biopsy, central venous catheter placement, or mechanical ventilation. Tension pneumothorax is a rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition in which trapped air accumulates under pressure, leading to severe respiratory distress, mediastinal shift, and hemodynamic instability. Immediate needle thoracostomy is required for decompression, followed by definitive chest tube placement. ## Etiology Traditionally, pneumothorax is divided into primary or secondary based on its etiology. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is more common in men and is frequently associated with underlying lung disease and smoking.[3] However, this simplified classification has become less accurate, as advancements in diagnostic techniques have revealed that many cases previously classified as primary are associated with secondary causes, such as parenchyma disorders, emphysema, or smoking-related lung disease.[4] Studies conducted in the United Kingdom have identified COPD as the leading cause of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, accounting for 70% to 80% of all cases. Tobacco smoking is recognized as the primary risk factor for primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as it increases the likelihood of pneumothorax due to its harmful effects on lung parenchyma.[5] In addition to traditional tobacco use, emerging evidence suggests that other forms of smoking, including cannabis use and vaping, may also contribute to the development of spontaneous pneumothorax.[6][7] In addition to smoke-related risks, secondary pneumothorax can also result from lung malignancies, infections—such as _Pneumocystis_ _jirovecii_ —and, more recently, severe cases of COVID-19.[8][9] Pneumothorax is broadly classified into 3 broad categories based on its etiology: - Traumatic pneumothorax: Results from blunt or penetrating chest trauma, such as rib fractures and gunshot wounds. - Iatrogenic pneumothorax: A subtype of traumatic pneumothorax caused by medical interventions, such as central line insertion, thoracentesis, device implantation, computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation or resuscitation.[10][11][12][13] - Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs without external trauma and is divided into 2 categories. - Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Develops in individuals without underlying lung disease - Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in individuals with significant underlying parenchymal lung disease, such as COPD or cystic fibrosis), often triggered by events such as bleb rupture.[14] Pneumothorax can also be classified into 4 categories based on its physiological impact: -
