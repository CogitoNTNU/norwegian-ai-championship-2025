50% of patients experiencing a significant improvement in the AHI after the first year.[72] Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) involves detaching both the upper and lower jaws and surgically advancing them anteriorly to increase space in the oropharynx.[73] This procedure is most effective for patients with retrognathia and tends to be less successful in older patients or those with larger neck circumferences. More recently, drug-induced sleep endoscopy has been used for preoperative planning, helping to identify multiple levels of obstruction in these patients and determining their candidacy for surgical treatments such as MMA or hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS).[74] This technique enables surgeons to address nasal, soft palate, and hypopharyngeal obstructions in a single surgery.[75] A newer treatment option is the implantable HNS, typically implanted unilaterally, although bilateral implantation has been reported recently.[76] This instrument works by stimulating the genioglossus muscle (an upper airway dilator) during apneas, causing tongue protrusion and relieving airway obstruction.[77] HNS effectively reduces the AHI, with a median AHI score at 12 months decreasing by 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour. HNS also improves sleepiness symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA who are unable to tolerate CPAP treatment.[78] Adverse events following HNS, both short- and long-term, are relatively uncommon. In a study, 134 adverse events were reported from 132 patients over 5 years.[79] The most common adverse events reported after HNS are tongue abrasion (11.0%), pain (6.2%), and device malfunction (3% to 6%).[77] The eligibility criteria for HNS adopted from the original randomized trial include the following characteristics: - Adults aged 18 or older - Moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI between 20 and 50 with \<25% central or mixed apneas) - Inability to tolerate CPAP - No complete concentric collapse at the palate on drug-induced sleep endoscopy [78] Exclusion criteria for HNS include: - BMI greater than 32.0 kg/m2 - Neuromuscular disease - Hypoglossal nerve palsy - Severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease - Moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension - Severe valvular heart disease - Heart failure, New York Heart Association class III or IV - Recent myocardial infarction or severe cardiac arrhythmias (within the past 6 months) - Persistent uncontrolled hypertension despite medication use - Active psychiatric disease and coexisting nonrespiratory sleep disorders In extreme cases, OSA may be treated with a tracheostomy to bypass the oropharyngeal obstruction. This treatment is typically best managed at academic or specialty sleep centers with experience in handling tracheostomy cases.
