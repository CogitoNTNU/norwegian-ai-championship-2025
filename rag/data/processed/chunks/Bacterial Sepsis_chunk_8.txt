These advances can be credited for the mortality improvement in septic patients that have been seen over the last 2 decades. However, with mortality from sepsis still approaching 20% to 25%, there are improvements still needed to treat and manage these complex patients. Therapies are directed at the basic elements of sepsis as a syndrome of infection, the host response, and organ dysfunction. The initial management of infection requires forming a probable diagnosis, obtaining cultures, and initiating appropriate and timely empirical anti-microbial therapy and source control. Attenuating the host response and accompanying organ dysfunction are both parts of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The initial resuscitation period was previously goal-directed, bundled care, something which the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines promote. Three large trials subsequently have shown no mortality benefit over usual care, which likely reflects the improvement of care, in general, with more of a trend toward early goal-directed therapies.[6][23][24][25] Despite the numerous trials and recommendations evaluating the components of this resuscitation, it remains a subject of debate and the source of ongoing clinical trials. The management, because of its complexities, has been grouped into 2 bundles of care, a 3 and 6-hour acute sepsis bundle, and a 24-hour sepsis management bundle. **Components of Acute Sepsis Bundle** \*\*_Three-Hour Bundle_ \*\* - Obtain appropriate cultures before administration of antibiotics - Obtain plasma lactate level - Administer appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics - Begin administration of crystalloid at 30 ml/kg for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L within the first 3 hours \*\*_Six-Hour Bundle_ \*\* - Start vasopressors if the patient
