: - Maintain aPTT 1.5 to 2 times of control - Based on the age and renal function, enoxaparin may be considered. **Anticoagulation** : Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after thrombolysis and during PCI is necessary to prevent thrombosis. In patients undergoing PCI, UFH boluses should be administered to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), taking into consideration whether Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is being used. Alternatively, bivalirudin can be used as an anticoagulant during PCI. However, fondaparinux should not be used as a sole anticoagulant in STEMI. **Beta-blocker** : Administer oral beta-blockers in patients without contraindications, especially in tachyarrhythmia or hypertension. Beta-blockers are commonly used to manage acute MI for several beneficial effects, such as reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, prevention of reinfarction, antiarrhythmic effects, and improvement of left ventricular function. **High-intensity statin therapy:** To manage AMI, patients without contraindications should be prescribed high-intensity statin therapy, such as atorvastatin 80 mg. **Adjunctive therapy:** Adjunctive therapy plays a crucial role in managing AMI. These include: - **P2Y12 inhibitors** : medications such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, are antiplatelet agents that help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. These are typically initiated with aspirin and continued for a specific time, depending on the patient's clinical presentation and chosen agent. - **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ ARB)** : these medications help reduce afterload, promote vasodilation, and inhibit the adverse remodeling of the heart following MI. ACE inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, to other high-risk features - **Spironolactone** : a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist, has reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) includes the following conditions: - Aortic dissection - Unstable angina - Stable angina - Vasospastic angina - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Myocardial trauma - Massive pulmonary embolism - Tension pneumothorax - Esophageal perforation - Esophageal spasm - Gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic acid disease - Musculoskeletal pain - Acute pericarditis - Myocarditis - Pulmonary embolism ## Staging Killip classification is a widely used system for assessing the 30-day prognosis in patients with STEMI. It helps categorize the severity of heart failure and determines the risk of adverse outcomes. The Killip classification is as follows: - **Killip class I:** This class indicates no evidence of heart
