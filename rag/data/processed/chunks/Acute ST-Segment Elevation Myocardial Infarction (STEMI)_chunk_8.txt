have demonstrated notable cardiovascular benefits.[50] ## Differential Diagnosis Other pathologies that can cause ST-segment elevation include myocarditis, pericarditis, stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo), benign early repolarization, acute vasospasm (Prinzmetal), spontaneous coronary artery dissection, LBBB, various channelopathies, and electrolyte abnormalities. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, often referred to as "broken heart syndrome," is a distinct cardiac condition that has garnered increased interest in recent years.[51] Originally identified in Japan in the early 1990s, this syndrome is marked by abrupt and profound dysfunction of the left ventricle, frequently precipitated by intense emotional stress or major life events. Unlike a conventional myocardial infarction caused by blocked coronary arteries, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs without significant coronary obstructions, setting it apart as a unique and perplexing cardiac disorder.[52] Prinzmetal angina, or vasospastic angina (VSA), arises from spontaneous coronary artery spasms, which can result in serious complications, particularly in individuals with increased coronary vasoconstriction and reduced vasodilation.[53] Early identification of patients at risk is crucial to prevent severe or fatal outcomes. While the exact prevalence of VSA remains uncertain, a study in Japan found that it may affect around 40% of individuals with angina, possibly higher than in White populations due to differences in clinical testing methods.[54] The primary treatment strategy involves using vasodilators and managing risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, lipid levels, stress, and alcohol consumption. VSA may also be linked to migraines. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is characterized by a tear in the epicardial coronary arteries, neither caused by medical procedures nor related to trauma or atherosclerosis.[55] Unlike the intraluminal thrombosis or plaque rupture that typically leads to ACS, SCAD-induced ACS results from myocardial damage from coronary artery obstruction following intimal disruption or the formation of an intramural hematoma, which creates a false lumen. SCAD predominantly affects individuals who lack traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors and is more frequently observed in younger women without underlying atherosclerotic disease.[56] Symptoms can vary widely, from chest pain to sudden cardiac death. Despite greater awareness and advancements in intravascular imaging, SCAD remains frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, often being mistaken for atherosclerotic disease. ## Prognosis The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score is a straightforward tool that uses 8 prognostic factors to evaluate the risk associated with STEMI at the bedside. The TIMI risk score is the most commonly used scoring system for 30-day mortality.[57] This scoring system incorporates: - Age older than 75 is assigned 3 points. Age between 64
