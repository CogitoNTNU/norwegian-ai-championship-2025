acute appendicitis should include a total leukocyte count with differential and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.[21] The white blood cell (WBC) count and CRP concentration have a positive predictive value when used together to differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis.\*\*\*\* A combination of a normal WBC count and a normal CRP value has a high negative predictive value for acute appendicitis. Increasing CRP and WBC levels significantly increases the likelihood of complicated appendicitis.[22] Leukocytosis is present in approximately two-thirds of patients with acute appendicitis. A left shift or bandemia may accompany this increase in WBC count. While no laboratory value can confirm or exclude acute appendicitis, most patients with acute appendicitis will have a WBC count of >10,000 cells/mm3. Accordingly, a WBC count â‰¥17,000 cells/mm3 is associated with complicated acute appendicitis. **Imaging** Appendicitis is primarily diagnosed based on clinical evaluation and examination. However, imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to improve the specificity of the presumptive diagnosis. CT is the preferred imaging modality in patients with suspected acute appendicitis. Ultrasound is less sensitive and specific than CT for diagnosing appendicitis. However, US is useful in evaluating populations where the avoidance of ionizing radiation is preferred, such as children and pregnant patients. MRI may also be useful for pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis who have had an indeterminate ultrasound. **Computed Tomography (CT)** An abdominopelvic CT scan with intravenous contrast demonstrates >95% accuracy in diagnosing acute appendicitis in adults. The criteria used in CT for diagnosing appendicitis include several features. These criteria encompass an enlarged appendix with an outer diameter of >6 mm to 8 or 9\*\*\*\* mm, thickening of the appendiceal wall measuring >2 mm to 3 mm, periappendiceal fat stranding, enhancement of the appendiceal wall, the presence of inflamed soft tissue at the appendiceal base separating the appendix from the cecum, and the existence of an appendicolith.[23] In most cases of appendicitis, observing intraluminal contrast media or air due to luminal distention is uncommon. The major concern with obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan is radiation exposure; however, the average exposure with a typical abdominopelvic CT does not exceed 4 mSv and is only slightly above the background exposure of almost 3 mSv. Despite the higher resolution of CT images obtained with the maximal radiation of 4 mSv, lower exposures do not affect the clinical outcomes. Moreover, obtaining an abdominopelvic
