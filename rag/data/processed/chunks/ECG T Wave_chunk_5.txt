avid proponents of heart disease awareness. Millions of dollars go toward educating the public every year on this topic.[16] However, it is essential that all healthcare providers regularly educate our patients on possible heart disease presentations so our patients can seek rapid, appropriate help. According to the 2018 USRDS report, kidney disease is rising in the United States of America.[17] Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of electrolyte abnormalities and may lead to T-wave changes. It is vital to educate our patients on appropriate risk factor modification through tight diabetes and blood pressure control. Primary prevention of kidney disease is essential. Those with previously developed kidney disease should be monitored closely for electrolyte abnormalities. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes When working in an emergent situation, communication between providers on all levels of training must be in sync.[14] Evidence supports the maximization of interprofessional communication, and care coordination optimizes healthcare outcomes.[18] While an ECG is a valuable tool, the appropriate diagnosis and early intervention must be addressed during the history and physical. It is highly recommended that protocols and algorithms be implemented at all institutions treating cardiac disease. This way, the best outcomes for our patients can be achieved. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20859&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20859) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/procedures/ecg-t-wave/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20859) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20859/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20859) [![Wellens Syndrome](/books/NBK538264/bin/Wellens__EKG__2-__cut.gif)](/books/NBK538264/figure/article-20859.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538264/figure/article-20859.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Wellens Syndrome.

As discussed, Type-A T waves often evolve into Type-B T waves, which is what occurred [(more...)](/books/NBK538264/figure/article-20859.image.f1/?report=objectonly) [![Image ](/books/NBK538264/bin/Twavemorphology.gif)](/books/NBK538264/figure/article-20859.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538264/figure/article-20859.image.f2/?report=objectonly) T-Wave Morphology Contributed by S Bhimji, MD ## References 1.
