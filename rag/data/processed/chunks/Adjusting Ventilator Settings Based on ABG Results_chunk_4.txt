carefully titrated to balance oxygenation improvement and avoid auto-PEEP. - Adjusting respiratory rate: A lower respiratory rate allows for longer exhalation times, reducing the risk of dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP.[15] **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome** Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition marked by poor oxygenation and reduced lung compliance. ARDS involves capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage. The condition is associated with high mortality and limited effective treatments. Mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS is associated with a high risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Managing ventilation in patients with ARDS requires a balance between adequate oxygenation and minimizing lung injury. This intervention is considered a lung-protective ventilation strategy.[16] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with a**cute respiratory distress syndrome\*\*\*\* - Low tidal volume ventilation: Using low tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg predicted body weight) is crucial to minimize barotrauma and volutrauma. This strategy has been shown to improve survival in patients with ARDS. - Appropriate PEEP levels: Applying PEEP helps prevent alveolar collapse and improves oxygenation. The PEEP level should be adjusted to optimize lung recruitment while avoiding overdistension. - Avoiding high plateau pressures: Plateau pressures lower than 30 cm H2O must be targeted. The plateau pressure is a measure of pulmonary compliance. - Avoiding high driving pressure: Monitoring and minimizing driving pressure—the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP—is essential for reducing the risk of VILI. Targeting a driving pressure below 15 cm H2O is associated with better outcomes.[17][18] **Bronchial Asthma** Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and variable airflow obstruction. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing which can vary over time and in intensity. Patients with asthma are at risk of dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP during mechanical ventilation.[19] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with bronchial asthma** Lower tidal volumes, slower respiratory rates, and shorter inspiratory times are recommended to allow for adequate exhalation time. Avoiding high PEEP levels is essential to prevent dynamic hyperinflation in patients with bronchial asthma.[20] **Restrictive Lung Diseases** Restrictive lung diseases are a diverse group of pulmonary disorders characterized by reduced lung distensibility, thus limiting lung expansion and decreasing lung volumes, particularly total lung capacity. Restrictive lung diseases can result from intrinsic factors, like interstitial lung diseases, or extrinsic factors, such as neuromuscular diseases, pleural disorders, obesity, and thoracic deformities that limit chest wall movement.[21] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with restrictive
