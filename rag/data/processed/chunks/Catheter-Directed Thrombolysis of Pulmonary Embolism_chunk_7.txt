attractive for high-risk pulmonary embolism patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis. Early data, though primarily observational, paints a promising picture. CDT reduces right ventricular dysfunction, a key predictor of mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, and shows promise in improving short-term functional limitations and hemodynamic measures.[30] However, definitive recommendations await more robust evidence from ongoing randomized controlled trials like PE-TRACT and HI-PEITHO, which compare CDT to standard anticoagulation in intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism patients. Until then, expert interventional cardiologists must rely on individualized assessments and collaborative decision-making within pulmonary embolism response teams.[25] These teams, empowered by local protocols and resources, can tailor therapy to each patient's needs. Implementing pulmonary embolism response teams and encouraging participation in clinical trials are key to unlocking CDT's full potential and improving outcomes for this vulnerable population. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes CDT offers improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe, hemodynamically unstable, massive, or submassive pulmonary embolisms. Without CDT, these patients are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The current guidelines recommend that all healthcare facilities treating pulmonary embolisms establish a PERT.[31] The PERT team is an interprofessional team comprising specialists from various clinical fields, including emergency medicine, critical care, cardiology, internal medicine, radiology, and specialty-trained nurses from critical care, radiology, and emergency care. Clinical pharmacists, especially those trained in critical care, cardiac care, and anticoagulation, are also essential members of this team. Working collaboratively, they can efficiently and effectively deliver CDT to improve patient care. Once CDT is chosen as a management course, the team should counsel the patient and family regarding the procedure's risks and benefits. A trained clinical provider knowledgeable in the risks and benefits should have this discussion with the nurses to ensure informed consent has been obtained. An anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist should then evaluate the patient to determine the need, mode, and safety of anesthetic delivery. An imaging specialist or structuralist may then be consulted for further recommendations on the size and burden of the pulmonary embolism. The emergency care and critical care nurses must assist in monitoring the patient during the procedure and subsequent infusion therapy for hemodynamic or neurologic complications. The clinical pharmacists assist the interventional team by providing appropriate medication and dosing for the procedure. The critical care pharmacist must help the team adjust other concurrent medications to minimize adverse side effects. Multiple studies have shown that the institution of a PERT can reduce
