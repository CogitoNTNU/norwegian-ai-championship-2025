rate and ultimately causing acute kidney injury and subsequent reduction in urine output. Blood is diverted from the renal cortex, further impairing renal function. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, leading to increased systemic vascular resistance through angiotensin II and increased reabsorption of water and sodium mediated by aldosterone. Studies indicate that oliguria can occur at an IAP of 15 mm Hg and anuria at pressures of 30 mm Hg. **Gastrointestinal System** Decreased abdominal compliance with increased IAP leads to decreased splanchnic blood flow, causing tissue hypoxia, increased capillary permeability, and edema. Further insult propagates the body's inflammatory response, exacerbates intestine malperfusion, and increases the risk of bacterial translocation and infection. The hepatic system is also affected as decreased hepatic flow leads to impaired metabolism and clearance, contributing to metabolic acidosis. **Nervous System** Elevated IAP also decreases venous drainage from the brain, which increases intracranial pressure and decreases cerebral blood flow. Increased PaCO2 also causes increased arterial blood flow to the brain, further increasing intracranial pressure.[10][21][22] ## History and Physical ACS is usually only observed in critically ill patients and is more frequently diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in the emergency department. Of note, physical examination is not a reliable indicator of ACS, even when performed by experienced clinicians, so objective measurements are necessary in any patient with risk factors for IAH.[9][23] If a patient has penetrating abdominal trauma, has received large amounts of fluid resuscitation, or has undergone extensive abdominal surgery, there should be a high clinical suspicion for ACS. Diagnosing ACS can be challenging as ICU patients may have a range of extra-abdominal organ failures. Patients may also be intubated and unable to communicate their symptoms, so thorough monitoring of IAP, chart review to obtain past medical history, and overall clinical picture are essential for diagnosis.[9] ## Evaluation Imaging modalities are not standard practice for the diagnosis of ACS. However, imaging can show early indicators of IAH that may ultimately lead to ACS, such as peritoneal-to-abdominal height ratio >0.52, a maximal anteroposterior to transverse abdominal diameter ratio of >0.8, bowel wall thickening, elevation of the diaphragm, narrowing of the vena cava \<3 mm, and a large amount of intra-abdominal fluid.[9] The most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis is measuring the intra-abdominal pressure. The IAP should be measured anytime there is a known IAH risk. IAP measurement can be achieved using both direct and indirect methods.
