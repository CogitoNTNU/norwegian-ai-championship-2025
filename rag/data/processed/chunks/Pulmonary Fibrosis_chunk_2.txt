the supply of protective stem cells and pericytes becomes depleted, likely making individuals more susceptible to fibroblast activation and proliferation.[9] Furthermore, several recent studies have reported an association between thyroid dysfunction and fibrosis in various organs, including the lungs.[10] This association indicates a potential role in the pathogenesis of IPF and the development of chronic fibrosis. **Genetic Mutations** IPF involves several genes crucial in lung development and the response to environmental injury, including _WNT_ , _TGF_ , _Notch_ , and sonic hedgehog (_SHH_). In addition, genes involved in the inflammatory process are also involved, and some of these include the Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) and the inhibitory protein of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.[8][9] Although most cases of IPF are idiopathic, some genetic factors that contribute to familial cases have been identified. Mutations in the telomerase genes (such as _TERT_), surfactant genes (such as _SFTPA2_), and mucin genes (such as _MUC5B_) have been known to lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is another rare autosomal recessive condition with defects in lysosome-related organelles that lead to albinism, platelet defects, and pulmonary fibrosis in many of the affected individuals (see **Image.** Putative Mechanisms of IPF).[11][12] ## Epidemiology IPF usually presents after the fifth or sixth decade of life and is more prevalent in older individuals. Research studies indicate a higher prevalence of IPF in males compared to females.[13] In Europe and North America, estimated IPF prevalence rates range from 0.33 to 2.51 and 2.40 to 2.98 per 10,000 people, respectively.[13] Data from a comprehensive database in the United States revealed a standardized incidence of 14.6 cases per 100,000 person-years, with a prevalence of 58.7 cases per 100,000 individuals during the study period.[14] The prevalence of IPF typically rises with age, with the majority of patients aged 50 or older and up to 85% being more than the age of 70.[15] However, the familial type of IPF tends to occur at a younger age, although it is much less common, accounting for only 3.7% of cases. The reported incidence of IPF ranges between 2.3 and 5.3 cases per 100,000 people per year.[16] ## Pathophysiology Environmental factors such as smoking, chronic aspiration, or respiratory infections, combined with advancing age, often result in respiratory alveolar epithelial injury and are the likely driving factors for the pathogenesis of IPF.[17] Epithelial injury triggers the activation of fibroblasts and disrupts the normal repair process of the alveolar epithelium. Consequently,
