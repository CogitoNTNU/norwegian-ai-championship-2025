Pleural effusion is diagnosed using a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and laboratory studies, particularly pleural fluid analysis. Thoracentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic for patients with this condition. Management strategies for this condition include treating the underlying cause, draining the accumulated fluid, and addressing complications such as infection and pleural fibrosis. **Pleural Space Anatomy** The lungs, enclosed within the bony thorax, expand and contract during respiration with the assistance of the pleural space. This space is between the visceral and parietal pleura and typically contains a thin layer of fluid that allows for smooth lung movements during respiration. The pleurae consist of the visceral and parietal layers and are integral to the thoracic cavity's anatomy. The visceral pleura is tightly adherent to the lung surface and forms a continuous covering that follows the contours of the lung lobes and fissures. The visceral pleura comprises a single mesothelial cell layer supported by connective tissue. This layer provides a frictionless surface that facilitates lung expansion and contraction during respiratory cycles. The parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity's inner surface and is divided into the mediastinal, diaphragmatic, costal, and cervical portions. This outer layer is thicker and more vascularized compared to the visceral pleura and contains sensory nerve fibers contributing to pain perception. The visceral and parietal pleurae enclose the pleural cavity, a potential space typically containing only a minimum volume of pleural fluid. This fluid minimizes friction between the pleural layers during respiratory movements. The volumetric fluid balance within the pleural space is determined by gravity, ventilatory motion, and hydrostatic and oncotic pressures.[4] Disorders affecting the pleurae, such as pleural effusion or pleurisy, can disrupt these functions, leading to respiratory symptoms and complications. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of pleural space anatomy and physiology is essential for effectively diagnosing and managing conditions involving these structures. ## Etiology Pleural effusion is caused by various conditions and is classified by Light's criteria as either a transudate or exudate. Differentiating between exudative and transudative fluids is essential in determining the underlying pathophysiology and subsequent diagnostic planning. Light's criteria serve as a reference standard for assessing pleural fluid parameters, including the quantitative ratio of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to serum LDH levels and the ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein levels. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if one or more of the following criteria are met: - Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio
