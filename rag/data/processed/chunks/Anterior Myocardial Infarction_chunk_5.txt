series of changes can be observed in myocardial infarction, beginning with the waviness of myocardial fibers, coagulation necrosis, myocardial edema, focal hemorrhage, and neutrophilic infiltration. This is followed by ongoing coagulation necrosis and pallor due to shrunken cells and contraction band necrosis. Subsequently, there is loss of striation (around 8 hours) and further necrosis with continued neutrophilic infiltration. This cascade of events leads to the disintegration of myocardial fibers and subsequent phagocytosis, resulting in a soft yellow-brown core surrounded by a hyperemic border. After complete phagocytosis, granulation tissue formation occurs along with neo-vascularization and a fibrous reaction (around 14 days), ultimately forming an organized fibrous scar (approximately 3 months). - Electron microscopy reveals early signs of myocardial damage, such as depletion of glycogen granules and swelling of mitochondrial and sarcolemma, which can be observed as early as 20 minutes after the onset of ischemia. This is followed by further mitochondrial disruption, formation of amorphous aggregates, and relaxation of myofibrils, typically occurring around 60 minutes. Finally, irreversible structural damage to myocardial cells begins manifesting within 20 minutes to 2 hours of the ischemic insult. ## History and Physical **History** Patients commonly present with classic angina symptoms, which can occur either at rest or at a lower activity level than what they typically experience. The intensity of the pain experienced by patients varies. Still, it is often most severe in individuals who seek medical attention due to their inability to tolerate the discomfort or extreme exhaustion following the episode of pain. The pain classically lasts longer than 30 minutes and can persist for hours if revascularization is not performed. Patients typically describe the pain as constricting, squeezing, or a heavy sensation in the chest. The discomfort is commonly felt retrosternally and may radiate to the bilateral shoulder, jaw/neck, or left arm. The pain may also cause numbness or tingling sensation in the ulnar aspect of the arm. Women may present with atypical symptoms, necessitating more suspicion and careful evaluation. Some patients may show atypical symptoms such as heart failure, extreme nervousness, apprehension, or even psychosis. Additionally, symptoms of systemic embolization can also be observed in some cases. Associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. History should include characteristics and duration of symptoms, aggravating and relieving factors, and the patient's functional capacity. In addition, patients should undergo a quick evaluation for risk factors like diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, previous
