This activity reviews the importance of adult echocardiography and highlights the interprofessional team's role in performing this procedure. **Objectives:** - Identify the indications for echocardiography. - Assess the anatomy of structures on the echocardiogram. - Evaluate the clinical significance of echocardiography. - Highlight how an interprofessional team approach can enhance patient outcomes by ensuring effective use of echocardiography in appropriate patient populations.

In 1950, the German scientist Wolfe Dieter Keidel utilized the transmitted ultrasonic wave technique to study the heart. However, he was not able to create information regarding cardiac function.[1] In 1953, Dr. Inge, the father of echocardiography and inventor of M-Mode, and Dr. Helmut Hertz established a commercial ultrasound machine to study the heart.[2] The development of echocardiography modalities such as M-Mode, A-mode, Doppler, transthoracic, transesophageal, contrast, stress echocardiography, and strain imaging took decades and helped achieve prompt diagnoses of various cardiac illnesses. ## Anatomy and Physiology Transthoracic Echocardiography views and anatomy: **Parasternal Long-axis View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view the left atrium left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, and aorta - Valves identified in this view: mitral valve and aortic valve - This view helps identify regurgitant and stenotic jets of mitral and aortic valves.[3] See **Image.** Parasternal Long Axis View on Transthoracic Echocardiography. **Parasternal Short-axis View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, right ventricle outflow tract, main pulmonary artery - Valves identified in this view: aortic valve, pulmonary valve, tricuspid valve - This view helps identify the tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease and patent ductus arteriosus. **Apical 4 Chamber View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle - Valves identified in this view: mitral and tricuspid valve - This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the inferior septal
