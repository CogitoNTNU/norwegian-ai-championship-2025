patients with Parkinson disease or dementia: up to 11% over 3 months [1] - Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, Huntington disease, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy.[1] - Head and neck cancer and its treatment increase the aspiration pneumonia risk, with up to 70% of patients developing aspiration pneumonia during their lifetime. This risk in survivors further increases with time.[1] In addition to the above predisposing factors, a crucial risk factor for aspiration pneumonia is the degree of bacterial colonization in oral secretions. Even minimal aspiration can lead to infection if there's a high density of bacterial colonization in oropharyngeal secretions, providing ample "bacterial load" for inoculation. A population-based case-control study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) noted poor oral health as a risk factor for infection. Similarly, poor oral health has been established as a significant risk factor for aspiration pneumonia among hospitalized patients.[3] ## Epidemiology The variability among patients with aspiration and inconsistent diagnostic practices pose challenges in determining the true incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Data suggests that up to 20% of individuals in the US experience some degree of impaired swallowing, contributing to approximately 0.4% of all hospital admissions being attributed to aspiration pneumonia.[1] The incidence of aspiration pneumonia among patients with CAP ranges between 5% and 15.5% in the US, United Kingdom, and Korea. However, studies from Japan report a notably higher incidence, around 60%, among patients presenting with CAP. Moreover, aspiration pneumonia among patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in Japan is approximately.[2] In patients under 80, an aspiration event leads to pneumonia only 5% of the time, whereas patients older than 80 develop pneumonia 10% of the time following such an event. Notably, among nursing home residents diagnosed with pneumonia, 18% to 30% of cases are associated with an aspiration event.[3] It is imperative to recognize that not all aspiration events result in pneumonia. For instance, in cases involving anesthesia, up to 64% of instances did not exhibit any clinical or radiological signs of infection following aspiration events.[4] ## Pathophysiology Aspiration pneumonia occurs when bacteria-rich fluid from the oropharynx or upper GI tract is aspirated into the lungs in sufficient quantities to overcome protective physiologic mechanisms against infection. Intact swallow and cough reflexes prevent aspiration in adequate amounts to produce pneumonia. However, impaired swallow or cough reflexes permit aspirated material to reach the alveoli, causing infection. Even small amounts
