healthcare expenditure, making sepsis the most expensive healthcare condition in 2009, accounting for 5% of total United States hospital costs.[9] The case fatality for patients with sepsis has been declining due to advances in sepsis management provided by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 through 2012 showed a mortality rate declined from 16.5% to 13.8%.[10] However, severe sepsis continues to rank among the most common causes of death in hospitalized patients.[11] Moreover, up to 25% of patients with severe sepsis and 50% of patients with septic shock will suffer mortality.[2] However, overall mortality from sepsis syndromes can vary from 30% to 50% [12] depending on demographic factors such as age, race, sex, co-morbid conditions, and the presence of organ dysfunction.[13] For example, in-patient mortality was predicted most by the number and degree of organ injury, with the strongest predictors being respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, and neurologic failure.[10] ## Pathophysiology Sepsis is a clinical state that falls along a continuum of pathophysiologic states, starting with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ending in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) before death. The earliest signs of inflammation are heralded by the following: 1. Fever (temperature higher than 38 C or hypothermia (temperature less than 36 C) 1. Tachycardia (heart rate more than 90 beats per minute), 1. Tachypnea (respiratory rate more than 20 breaths per minute) 1. Leukocytosis (WBC greater than 12,000/cu mm) / leukopenia (white blood cells (WBC) less than 4,000/cu mm) with or without bandemia (more than 10%). The presence of two of these four clinical signs is necessary for the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. After that, systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious source suffices the clinical definition for sepsis.[14] With the development of hypotension, tissue demands are not adequately met by tissue oxygenation, and the patient is now defined to be in severe sepsis.[14] The decline in peripheral vascular perfusion and oxygenation leads to cellular and metabolic derangements, most notably a shift from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration with ensuing lactic acidosis. Tissue hypoperfusion may also be manifested by signs of end-organ damage, such as pre-renal azotemia or transaminitis. The difference in oxygen supply and demand can be monitored during resuscitation by trending the mixed venous oxygen saturation from a central line in the superior vena cava (SVC) when available.[1] When sepsis-induced hypotension remains refractory to initial management with fluid resuscitation,
