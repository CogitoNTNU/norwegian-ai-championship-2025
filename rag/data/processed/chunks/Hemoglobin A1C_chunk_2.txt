the glycated fractions measured. The IFCC method is not intended for routine clinical use but is a calibration standard for commercial assays. For clinical testing, NGSP-certified methods are recommended.[14] In laboratory settings, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using cation-exchange chromatography remains a cornerstone technique for HbA1c measurement. This method effectively removes labile intermediates that may interfere with alternative approaches, such as immunoassays or affinity chromatography. Fully automated HPLC systems are widely available, requiring minimal sample volumes (approximately 5 μL of whole blood). Although venous blood is standard, capillary blood from a finger prick is also acceptable. Samples are diluted with a borate-containing hemolysis reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes to eliminate labile Schiff bases before analysis.[15][16] Immunoassay-based methods are also prevalent, using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the Amadori product (ketoamine linkage) and distinct amino acid sequences at the N-terminal of the hemoglobin β-chain. A widely used format, latex agglutination inhibition, involves a synthetic polymer bearing HbA1c epitopes that competes with patient HbA1c for binding to antibody-coated latex beads. This competition reduces agglutination, which is quantifiable as decreased absorbance. Enzyme immunoassays using analogous antibodies exhibit acceptable precision and are typically calibrated to HPLC-derived values. These assays are highly specific, excluding labile intermediates; other glycated hemoglobin, such as HbA1a and HbA1b; and common hemoglobin variants, such as HbF, HbA2, HbS, and carbamylated hemoglobin.[17][18] Recent advancements have introduced enzymatic assays using fructosyl peptide oxidase for HbA1c quantification, alongside automated liquid-flow capillary electrophoresis systems, which provide viable alternatives for routine clinical testing.[19] POC devices are increasingly used for HbA1c measurement in clinical settings. However, the diversity of available POC systems complicates selection, as comparative performance data are limited. Notably, POC measurements typically yield values approximately 0.5% lower than laboratory-based assays and may exhibit reduced accuracy compared to venous blood samples analyzed in a laboratory. Inter-laboratory variability in HbA1c results can reach 0.5%, underscoring the importance of standardized methodologies to ensure reliable clinical outcomes.[20][21] ## Interfering Factors Several conditions can interfere with the accuracy of HbA1c testing. Individuals with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, anemia, kidney failure, liver disease, or those receiving blood transfusions can experience altered results due to the longevity of the red blood cell. HbA1c measurement in these patients must be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with plasma glucose samples to diagnose diabetes mellitus.[22] A falsely low HbA1c value can result from several conditions, including high altitude, pregnancy, hemorrhage, blood
