The deep PCA supplies the thalamus and other posterior deep structures of the brain. The occipital lobe is the location of the visual cortex. The thalamus is the main relaying center for ascending and descending nervous networks. The most common cause of a PCA infarct is an atherothrombotic lesion in the vertebral artery. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27488)," for more information. PCA infarctions can be divided into deep and superficial categories based on the PCA supply. If the deep segments of the PCA are involved, the symptoms are mainly related to thalamic dysfunction. The symptoms may include hypersomnolence, cognitive deficits, ocular findings, hypoesthesia, and ataxia. Larger infarcts that involve the deep structures can lead to hemisensory loss and hemiparesis due to the involvement of the thalamus and the adjacent internal capsule. Superficial infarcts present mainly with contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often with macular sparing. Rarely, bilateral PCA infarcts present with amnesia and cortical blindness.[24][25] In many posterior circulation strokes, symptomatology can be subtle; therefore, healthcare providers should have a low index of suspicion and obtain imaging and neurology consultations earlier (see **Image.** Axial Section on Noncontrast CT Head Shows Left PCA Ischemic Stroke and No Hemorrhage).[26] **Vertebrobasilar Infarction** The vertebrobasilar region of the brain is supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries and the basilar artery as they course the anterior surface of the pons. The vertebral arteries arise from their respective subclavian artery, course through the transverse foramina of the upper 6 cervical vertebrae, and enter the skull through the foramen magnum. The main branches of each vertebral artery are the posterior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the anterior spinal artery. The vertebral arteries terminate by merging to form the basilar artery. The basilar artery bifurcates into 2 posterior cerebral arteries, which join the circle of Willis. In addition to the paramedian penetrating branches, the basilar artery gives rise to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the superior cerebellar artery. These arteries supply the cerebellum and brainstem.[27] The clinical presentation includes ataxia, vertigo, headache, vomiting, oropharyngeal dysfunction, visual field deficits, and abnormal oculomotor findings. Patterns of clinical presentation vary depending on the location and the infarction pattern of embolism or atherosclerosis. [28][29] **Cerebellar Infarction** Patients may present with ataxia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dysarthria, and vertigo symptoms. In addition, edema and rapid clinical deterioration can complicate cerebellar infarction.[28] **Lacunar Infarction** Lacunar infarcts result from the occlusion of small perforating
