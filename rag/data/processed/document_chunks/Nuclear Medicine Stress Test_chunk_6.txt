of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2020, it was estimated that deaths from CAD might increase to 11.1 million globally.[11] Healthy lifestyle choices such as exercise, dietary interventions, reducing weight, and smoking cessation can substantially reduce CAD.[12] Cardiac stress testing is an extraordinary diagnostic and prognostic tool for patients with suspected heart disease. It evaluates cardiac perfusion and function at rest and after stress, such as exercise or pharmacological. It also assesses functional and anatomic CAD. Multiple secondary interventions to prevent MI and the progression of CAD can be undertaken. An appropriate intervention targeted towards individual patients can reduce the global burden, morbidity and improved quality of life in patients with CAD.[13] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26009&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26009) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26009/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26009) ## References 1.
