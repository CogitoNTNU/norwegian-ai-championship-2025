causing pericarditis, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19, HIV, influenza, and several herpes viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).[9][10] Bacterial pericarditis occurs infrequently in in developed countries; however, tuberculosis remains widespread in developing regions and is the most common cause of pericarditis in endemic areas.[11] This is particularly true for HIV-positive patients, among whom the infection rate continues to rise.[12] Less commonly, bacteria such as _Coxiella burnetii_ , _Neisseria meningitidis_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , _Staphylococcus_ , and _Streptococcus_ can cause pericarditis, with life-threatening cases of purulent cardiac tamponade documented in the literature.[13] In rare instances, fungal organisms such as _Histoplasma_ , _Coccidioides_ , _Candida_ , and _Blastomyces_ or parasitic species such as _Echinococcus_ and _Toxoplasma_ can also cause pericarditis.[14] When these pathogens are identified, an underlying immunocompromised state should be strongly considered, as many fungi and parasites—particularly _Histoplasma_ and _Toxoplasma_ —are opportunistic infections, and they have been described as predominant in HIV-positive patients. **Noninfectious Causes of Pericarditis** Noninfectious causes of pericarditis are varied and include malignancy (often secondary to metastatic disease), connective tissue disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet's disease), and metabolic conditions (such as uremia and myxedema).[7][9] **Additional Causes of Pericarditis** Trauma can also lead to pericarditis, which may present as an early onset following injury or, more commonly, as a delayed inflammatory reaction.[15] Dressler Syndrome, also known as "late post-myocardial infarction syndrome," is a well-recognized post-cardiac injury syndrome characterized by pericarditis following acute coronary syndrome, with a delayed inflammatory response typically occurring several weeks after the initial event.[2][5][16] Notably, it is believed that Dressler syndrome occurs secondary to the formation of anti-myocardial antibodies as a delayed autoimmune response, leading to pericarditis symptoms in the late post-myocardial infarction stage.[17] When first described, Dressler syndrome was estimated to occur in 5% to 7% of myocardial infarction cases; however, it has become uncommon due to advancements in the management of acute coronary syndrome, which have led to early revascularization and a reduced burden of myocardial injury. Other post-cardiac injury syndromes can also arise following percutaneous intervention, cardiac surgery, or blunt trauma.[16] Multiple medications have been implicated in drug-induced pericarditis, although its incidence remains rare. Historically, certain drugs such as procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid have been associated with medication-induced SLE, leading to serositis and pericardial involvement manifesting as pericarditis.[18] More recently, checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab have been increasingly
