it remains a subject of debate and the source of ongoing clinical trials. The management, because of its complexities, has been grouped into 2 bundles of care, a 3 and 6-hour acute sepsis bundle, and a 24-hour sepsis management bundle. **Components of Acute Sepsis Bundle** \*\*_Three-Hour Bundle_ \*\* - Obtain appropriate cultures before administration of antibiotics - Obtain plasma lactate level - Administer appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics - Begin administration of crystalloid at 30 ml/kg for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L within the first 3 hours \*\*_Six-Hour Bundle_ \*\* - Start vasopressors if the patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a mean arterial pressure level greater than or equal to 65 mmHg - In the event of persistent hypotension after initial fluid administration, or if initial lactate is greater than 4 mmol/L, reassess volume status and tissue perfusion and document findings - Re-measure lactate if initial lactate was elevated **Components of the Sepsis Management Bundle**(to be completed in the next 24 hours) - Administer low-dose steroid if indicated: Hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per day - Maintain blood glucose levels less than 180 mg/dL - Maintain plateau airway pressure at less than 30 cm H2O in ventilator-dependent patients: Employ a lung-protective ventilator strategy - Reassess antibiotic therapy daily for de-escalation when appropriate - Early Initiation of enteral feeding rather than complete fast or parenteral nutrition - Perform source control, where indicated, within 12 hours of identification - Administer prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis - Administer stress-ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding Antimicrobial therapy is strongly recommended to be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock has been made. Delays in initiating antibiotic therapy have been associated with increased mortality. Recommendations have been made for initiating therapy within 1 hour of diagnosis; however, there appears to be some dispute about the importance of this timing.[26] Despite the observation that mortality from sepsis is not related to the site of infection or the causative organism, including multi-drug resistant organisms, the delay in administering appropriate antibiotics does affect mortality.[27] For this reason, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the suspected source are recommended, not necessarily the most appropriate antimicrobial agent. Obtaining appropriate cultures is intended to influence care after this acute resuscitation phase has already passed. Lots of emphasis has been placed in the past on
