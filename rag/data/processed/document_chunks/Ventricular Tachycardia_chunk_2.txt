consistent. Typically, 4-electrode catheters are inserted for electrical recording and pacing, including: - High right atrium - HIS bundle - Right ventricle (RV) - Coronary sinus A fifth catheter is used for radiofrequency or cryoablation. **Electrophysiology Study** Observations and maneuvers are typically categorized based on whether they are performed during sinus rhythm or tachycardia. ## Clinical Significance **Observations and Pacing Maneuvers During Sinus Rhythm** Anterograde conduction during sinus rhythm is assessed at baseline and during atrial pacing, with a focus on identifying ventricular preexcitation and dual AV node physiology. Ventricular preexcitation on a baseline electrocardiogram in a patient with narrow complex SVT suggests AVRT as the likely mechanism. However, preexcitation does not exclude other causes of narrow-complex tachycardia. **Atrial Pacing During Sinus Rhythm** Atrial pacing during sinus rhythm helps identify dual AV nodal physiology and the presence of ventricular preexcitation. During atrial extrastimuli pacing, an “atrium to His (A-H) jump” is observed when a 10-millisecond decrease in the S1S2 coupling interval causes a greater than 50-millisecond increase in the A-H interval, which indicates the presence of dual AV nodal physiology. Additionally, decremental atrial pacing or atrial extrastimuli pacing can increase the degree of ventricular preexcitation or, in rare cases, uncover previously unrecognized ventricular preexcitation, especially from a left lateral accessory pathway. **Ventricular Pacing During Sinus Rhythm** Ventricular pacing during sinus rhythm is a valuable tool for assessing the presence and location of concealed accessory pathways. This technique also aids in identifying nonseptal accessory pathways by revealing eccentric retrograde atrial activation patterns. When retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction is concentric—meaning the earliest atrial activation occurs along the septum—differential ventricular pacing can help identify a septal accessory pathway. This technique distinguishes retrograde conduction via the AV node from conduction through a septal accessory pathway, thereby differentiating nodal from extranodal responses. Differential ventricular pacing is performed from both the RV apex and the RV base. The RV apex is located near the exit of the right bundle branch (RBB) fibers. In contrast, the RV base is closer to the typical insertion site of ventricular septal accessory pathways. During pacing, the stimulus-to-atrial (Stim-A or V-A) intervals are compared between the 2 pacing sites (see **Image.** Differential Ventricular Pacing Responses). In cases where a septal accessory pathway is absent and ventricular activation conduction occurs exclusively through the AV node, pacing from the RV apex results in a shorter Stim-A or V-A interval than pacing from the
