and further help risk-stratify individuals and direct treatment.[1] In addition to assessing leukocytosis, some providers may evaluate a left-shift typical of legionellosis or perform a procalcitonin test to help differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However,\*\*\*\* the yield of pro-calcitonin in the clinical setting is often mixed.[49][50][51][52] _Legionella_ species infection may be associated with hyponatremia on electrolyte testing.[53] Patients admitted to the hospital with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia should undergo urinary antigen testing for _L. pneumophila_ species, as _L. longbeachae_ may not be detected by this test. Swabs should also be taken to exclude viral causes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR). Depending on the setting and resources of the healthcare institution, PCR testing can also be run on multiplex panels that include atypical bacterial organisms, including _Legionella_ ,_Chlamydia_ , and _Mycoplasma_ ,\_\_ that appear equivalent to standard single-organism PCR and sequencing.[54][55] Serology testing can be used to confirm cases, but given the time taken to obtain paired samples to analyze for immunoglobulin titer rise or seroconversion, these tests may not assist in the acute clinical setting.[56][57] In addition, it is important to obtain blood cultures to exclude associated bacteremia and, if necessary, collect deep sputum cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens to exclude typical bacterial infections and other infectious causes, such as viruses and fungi, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. These tests can also help identify the growth of atypical bacteria despite the lower yield compared to molecular testing.[1][54]\*\*\*\* These efforts may ultimately assist with later antimicrobial rationalization and de-escalation of antibiotics once the patient has improved. In ill-appearing individuals or those in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a chest x-ray is the diagnostic gold standard. Classic imaging findings in atypical pneumonia include patchy infiltrates, sometimes bilateral in distribution, and interstitial patterns, but these may reflect worse changes than what the patient presents with.[58] The chest x-ray may show a mild infiltrative process with hilar adenopathy.[29] On computed tomography (CT) imaging, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodule formation, ground glass attenuation, and consolidation may be more evident in atypical bacterial pneumonia compared to typical bacterial pneumonia.[59] Atypical bacterial pneumonia is less commonly associated with lobar consolidations and complicated parenchymal findings such as empyema. Severe manifestations may still occur with the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome and alveolar hemorrhage should still be considered in the critically unwell patient.[60][61] Bedside ultrasonography can potentially differentiate between atypical bacterial pneumonia and
