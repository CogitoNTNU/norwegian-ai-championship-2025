Consultation with infectious disease specialists can be useful in both ascertaining the etiology of viral pneumonia and its relative clinical role if bacterial co-infection is suspected. 1. Consultation with a pulmonary/critical care physician is advisable if the patient is hypoxic or requires advanced airway or placement in a critical care setting. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patient education and preventative medicine play a key role in the clinical management of viral pneumonia: - Education to promote universal vaccination against measles and varicella - Education to promote appropriate influenza vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis - Education of prenatal patient's about influenza and varicella immunity - HIV prevention and CD4 count surveillance with appropriate
