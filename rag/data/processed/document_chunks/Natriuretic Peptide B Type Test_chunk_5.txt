BNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 17% to 38% for glycosylated proBNP and 5% to 14% for non-glycosylated proBNP.[44] For NT-proBNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 29% to 249% for non-glycosylated proBNP but with no cross-reactivity towards glycosylated proBNP.[45] The relative composition of blood with regard to the various BNP, NT-proBNP, proBNP, and glycosylated forms present in the blood of patients with heart failure is not known.[46] Therefore, comparing the results of different markers and different assays of the same marker will be difficult.[8] The clinical significance of the presence of HAMA and heterophile antibodies is diminished for BNP and NT-proBNP assays; mild false-positive results do not have significant clinical implications.[47] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings BNP and NT-proBNP levels increase in patients with cardiac disease due to myocardial stress and volume overload.[42] Patients with a BNP elevation of over 100 pg/mL should be assessed further for the signs and symptoms of cardiac disease.[48] Though BNP is traditionally used in the diagnosis of left ventricular systolic function, it can be elevated through other processes as well; for example, right ventricular failure, acute myocardial infarction, congenital heart disease, and valvular disease.[6] Other situations in which natriuretic peptides are elevated include any disease that increases blood volume and thus wall stress, such as sepsis, anemia, renal dysfunction, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy, and cirrhosis.[49] In healthy individuals, BNP levels vary by age and genetic sex; levels increase with age and are higher on average in females than males.[34] Circulating levels of natriuretic peptides increase after acute myocardial infarction; the extent of the increase is related to the size of the infarct.[50] Patients with smaller infarcts tend to have a monophasic increase in plasma BNP, peaking at 20 hours after the onset of symptoms; on the other hand, those with larger infarcts, lower ejection fraction, and clinical signs of heart failure may present a further peak at five days after admission.[51] A value of less than 100 pg/mL for BNP and less than 300 pg/mL for NT-proBNP makes the diagnosis of heart failure less likely in an acutely dyspneic patient.[52] Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides are associated with poor long-term prognosis and have an adverse impact on long-term mortality in patients with heart failure and various other conditions such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.[53] ## Clinical Significance **Heart Failure** The strongest indication for BNP measurement is distinguishing between cardiogenic
