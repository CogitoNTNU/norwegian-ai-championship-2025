comprehensive database in the United States revealed a standardized incidence of 14.6 cases per 100,000 person-years, with a prevalence of 58.7 cases per 100,000 individuals during the study period.[14] The prevalence of IPF typically rises with age, with the majority of patients aged 50 or older and up to 85% being more than the age of 70.[15] However, the familial type of IPF tends to occur at a younger age, although it is much less common, accounting for only 3.7% of cases. The reported incidence of IPF ranges between 2.3 and 5.3 cases per 100,000 people per year.[16] ## Pathophysiology Environmental factors such as smoking, chronic aspiration, or respiratory infections, combined with advancing age, often result in respiratory alveolar epithelial injury and are the likely driving factors for the pathogenesis of IPF.[17] Epithelial injury triggers the activation of fibroblasts and disrupts the normal repair process of the alveolar epithelium. Consequently, this dysregulated repair process leads to increased matrix deposition in the lung interstitium and scarring, ultimately destroying lung architecture and the development of pulmonary fibrosis.[12] The destruction of lung architecture impairs gas exchange and progresses to hypoxic respiratory failureâ€”a hallmark of advanced disease. About 70% to 80% of patients with IPF have a history of smoking, explaining why around 30% also present with concurrent emphysema. This subgroup of patients with both IPF and emphysema exhibits a distinct PFT profile. Specifically, they typically demonstrate relatively preserved total lung capacity and forced vital capacity (FVC), yet significantly decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This profile is likely attributed to the combined effects of parenchymal fibrosis and destruction associated with both conditions.[18] As pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea are prevalent among patients with IPF,[19] screening for these comorbidities is essential in patients. Even mild pulmonary hypertension is a poor prognostic indicator.[9][18][20] IPF is also highly linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). In a study evaluating lung transplant candidates for CAD as part of the transplant work-up, 29% of those with IPF were found to have significant CAD, compared to only 10% of those with emphysema, despite a higher proportion of heavy smokers in the emphysema group.[9][21] The prevalence of CAD in patients with IPF is estimated at 4% to 25%, and patients with IPF have a 3-fold increased risk of acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without IPF.[18] Patients with IPF have a significantly higher risk of venous
