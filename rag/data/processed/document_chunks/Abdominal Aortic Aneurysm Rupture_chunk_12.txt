convey the results to the interprofessional team to initiate feeding. Before discharge, the pharmacist and nurse should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance, blood pressure control, and tobacco avoidance. The nurse should also ensure that the appropriate consulting clinician, dietitian, or social workers have spoken to the patient and that the surgeon has been notified before discharge. Open communication among the interprofessional team is vital to ensure good outcomes. **Outcomes** For elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the outcomes are good, with minimal morbidity. However, if a rupture has occurred, the mortality rates can exceed 50%. Current guidelines suggest that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo surgery in hospitals with an interprofessional team approach to manage this pathology. To improve outcomes, it is imperative that patients stop smoking, maintain a healthy body weight, control their blood pressure, and remain compliant with medications. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17011&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17011) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17011) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17011/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17011) [![Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration](/books/NBK470237/bin/Aortadiagramgray.gif)](/books/NBK470237/figure/article-17011.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470237/figure/article-17011.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration.
