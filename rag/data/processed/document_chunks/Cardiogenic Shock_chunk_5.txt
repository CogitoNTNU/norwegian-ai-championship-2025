Non-IABP percutaneous mechanical devices - ECMO **IABP- Intra-aortic balloon pump** - Most commonly used and least expensive of all mechanical support devices. - Easy and rapid insertion. - It is the device with which interventional cardiologists are most familiar. Some of the other indications apart from cardiogenic shock include intractable angina, adjunctive therapy in high risk or complicated angioplasty, refractory heart failure as a bridge to future therapy, intractable ventricular arrhythmias as a bridge to therapy. Mechanism: Blood is displaced into the proximal aorta by inflation during diastole, during systolic, rapid balloon deflation occurs, creating a vacuum effect and reducing the afterload. Contraindications include severe aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, uncontrolled sepsis, uncontrolled bleeding disorders. The patient needs to be on therapeutic anticoagulation to avoid thrombosis, and heparin is the most common anticoagulation used. Daily labs, including creatinine, platelet count, and hemoglobin, need to be checked. Uncommon events like cholesterol embolization and balloon rupture are rare occurrences. Limitations of IABP include variable effect on total coronary blood flow, no mortality benefit, modest hemodynamic support.[12] **Non-IABP percutaneous mechanical devices** _Left ventricular assist devices_ 1\. Left ventricle to aorta- percutaneous transvalvular left ventricular assistance device (LVAD) 2\. Left-atrium-to-aorta assist device- 3\. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support with the use of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). _Right ventricular assist device_ -The LVAD system is available in 2 different versions (2.5 and 5.0). The larger version needs surgical implantation, whereas the smaller motion could be placed percutaneously.-This has an axial flow pump that revolves at a high speed displacing blood from the left ventricle to the proximal ascending aorta and works on the principle of Archimedes screw. -Protective to trial compared to a 30-day incidence of major adverse events between intractable on the pump and the 2.5 LVAD. It showed no difference between the 2 groups; trends for improved outcomes were observed for the 2.5 supported patients at 90 days. -Placement of the LVAD system takes a longer time compared to IABP and needs more experience. However, it provides a better improvement in cardiac index. _Left-atrium-to-aorta assist device_ With a percutaneous left atrium to aortic assistive device, blood is pumped from the left atrium to the iliofemoral system. It is approved by the US FDA for 6 hours of support. A randomized control trial comparing this device with an IABP in 41 patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction.
