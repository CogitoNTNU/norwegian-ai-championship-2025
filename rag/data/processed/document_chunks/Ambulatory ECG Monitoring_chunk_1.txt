portable devices to record and analyze cardiac electrical activity over extended periods. Continuous, prolonged monitoring is more likely to detect transient or infrequent cardiac events that may go unnoticed during short-term recordings. The prototype of ambulatory ECG monitoring is the Holter monitor, invented in 1961.[5] Ambulatory ECG monitoring has continually advanced; multiple devices are now available to improve diagnostic yield.[6] Prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring is uniquely poised to capture elusive arrhythmias, evaluate the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapies, and assess overall cardiovascular health.[7] This activity reviews the various ambulatory ECG monitoring devices currently in clinical use and the indications, critical findings, and clinical significance of this testing modality. ## Procedures Various ambulatory ECG monitoring systems are in regular clinical use. These systems include but are not limited to the Holter monitor, different event recorders, patch monitors, mobile outpatient cardiac telemetry, and various implantable devices. Additionally, several consumer devices are available for monitoring the cardiac conduction system. **Continuous ECG Monitor** Continuous ECG monitors, or Holter monitors, are the most commonly utilized ambulatory ECG monitoring devices. Holter monitors permit the continuous recording of cardiac electrical activity for an extended period, typically 24 to 72 hours. These monitors are indispensable when evaluating patients with intermittent symptoms, effectively capturing episodes of arrhythmias that might otherwise remain undetected. [8] Holter monitors are lightweight devices comprising electrodes attached to the patient's chest and connected to a compact recording device approximately the size of a deck of cards that may be worn on the waist or carried in a convenient pouch. (See **Image.** Holter Monitor) Holter monitor recordings can be acquired in 2-, 3-, or 12-channel formats. The primary advantage of the Holter monitor is the capture of an extended duration of ECG data, enabling the detection and analysis of transient and infrequent arrhythmias easily missed during a snapshot ECG. Conventional Holter monitors require active patient participation; patients must manually record their symptoms in a journal or mark their occurrence by pressing a button on the recording device. The data obtained from a Holter monitor is downloaded, and a comprehensive report is generated. Reports include various parameters, including total heartbeats, average heart rate, maximum and minimum heart rates, number and type of premature beats, the duration and type of various tachyarrhythmias, and ST segment changes.
