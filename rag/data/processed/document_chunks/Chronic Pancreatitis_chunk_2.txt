with alcohol use disorder develop chronic pancreatitis, suggesting that other factors, such as smoking, may also contribute to its development.

Genetic Polymorphisms Related to Chronic Pancreatitis. Reference for the table.[11] ## Epidemiology Due to its slow progression, particularly when in alcohol-related cases, chronic pancreatitis is often diagnosed late. A 2014 epidemiological report estimated that its incidence has remained stable over the years, though its prevalence may be underestimated, warranting further studies.[12][13] In the United States, chronic pancreatitis is more common among Black individuals than White individuals. Risk factors also vary by sexâ€”alcohol and tobacco use are the primary contributors in men, whereas idiopathic and obstructive causes are more common in women.[14] Overall, the condition is more prevalent in men, likely due to higher rates of alcohol and tobacco use. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 45 years, with onset occurring about a decade later in parts of China.[15] ## Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis appears to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Studies have identified pancreatitis susceptibility genes associated with loss of function. Two main theories explain the development of chronic pancreatic disease. The first theory suggests that impaired bicarbonate secretion fails to counterbalance increased pancreatic protein secretion. As a result, excess proteins form plugs within the lobules and ducts, leading to calcification and stone formation. The second theory involves the intraparenchymal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas, potentially triggered by genetic predisposition or external influences such as alcohol consumption. Recent research suggests that alcohol diminishes the cell's ability to respond to calcium signaling. This reduced response disrupts the feedback mechanism and initiates a cycle of cellular damage, leading to cell death.[16][17] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, characterized by steatorrhea and azotorrhea, becomes clinically evident after over 90% of pancreatic function is lost.[1] This condition typically manifests at least 5 years after the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis. Although the first and second episodes rarely lead to chronic disease, the likelihood rises from 16% to 50% after the third or fourth episode. A proposed explanation is that alcoholic pancreatitis is more likely to recur than biliary pancreatitis, which typically occurs only once. Continued alcohol consumption contributes to progressive pancreatic damage. In addition, each recurrent episode causes further injury to an already compromised pancreas. By the third episode and beyond, acute
