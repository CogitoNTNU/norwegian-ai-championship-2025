to obtain limited imaging sequences. **Chest/Cardiac** : MRI with IV contrast agents and customized fields of view are appropriate to evaluate chest wall abnormalities that are not definitively diagnosable with other modalities. MRI technologists are educated to mark the area of concern with an MRI visible Vitamin E capsule. While contrast-enhanced MR can define the extent of mediastinal soft tissue involvement, a literature review shows that the more costly MR was only superior to CT for preoperative planning of posterior mediastinal masses.[12] Cardiac MRI provides both structural and functional information. It requires the patient to tolerate upwards of 45 minutes of imaging and comply with breath-holding instructions. Non-contrast techniques are emerging, but current cardiac MR protocols typically include intravenous contrast agents; patterns of late gadolinium enhancement are critical to identifying scarred tissue.[13] Tissue characterization using extra-cellular volume fraction and T1 mapping has made cardiac MRIs invaluable in the diagnostic workup of infiltrative cardiomyopathies, oftentimes negating the need for invasive endomyocardial biopsies. Stress cardiac MRIs may also be performed, which provide structural information and serve as an ischemic evaluation and myocardial viability study. **Abdomen/Pelvis** : Multiphase, post-contrast sequences are helpful to characterize abdominopelvic lesions and masses and follow responses to therapy. MR usually follows the more cost-effective and widely available initial imaging like ultrasound or CT, for example: - Radiologists can confidently characterize a benign versus malignant liver lesion by MR enhancement patterns with liver and biliary-specific contrast agents. Studies show that MRI with contrast is superior to ultrasound in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in high-risk populations, defined as higher detection rates and decreased false positives.[14] - A small study of 81 female patients with sonographically indeterminate pelvic masses showed that even limited sequence MR could define uterine vs. extra-uterine origins of a mass, determining and guiding clinical management.[15] - MRI plays a critical role in diagnosing, staging, treatment, surgical planning, and surveillance of rectal cancer. - The radiologist may recommend a follow-up MRI in the appropriate clinical settings. A detailed history is critical when ordering these exams to ensure the acquisition of appropriate sequences. Of note, some institutions have established abdominal MR protocols to evaluate the appendix in pregnant women and small children if ultrasound is not diagnostic. **Musculoskeletal** : Magnetic resonance imaging is useful to diagnose internal derangements of the support structures of the joints, occult fractures, bone marrow edema, infiltrative processes of the marrow space, and soft-tissue masses.
