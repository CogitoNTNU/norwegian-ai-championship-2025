aim to reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.[1] Separate from the ACC/AHA Stage of Heart Failure is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure. This classification is a subjective assessment by a clinician to characterize the functional capacity and symptoms of patients with ACC/AHA stage C or D heart failure.[1] The NYHA Classification is an independent predictor of mortality and is employed clinically to determine the suitability of therapeutic interventions for patients with stage C or D heart failure.[5][1] The 4 NYHA heart failure classes are as follows: - **Class I** : asymptomatic - **Class II** : symptomatic with moderate activity - **Class III** : symptomatic with mild activity - **Class IV** : symptomatic at rest. Heart failure is further classified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).[1] The prognosis and response to treatment of patients with heart failure differs significantly when patients are stratified based on LVEF. In 2022, the ACC, AHA, and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) released guidelines for the management of heart failure that incorporate the following classification of heart failure by LVEF: - **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)** : patients with an LVEF ≤40% - **Heart Failure with Improved Ejection Fraction (HFimpEF)** : patients with a previous LVEF ≤40% and a subsequent measurement of LVEF >40% - **Heart Failure with Mildly Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF)** : patients with an LVEF 41% to 49% with evidence of spontaneous or provokable increased left ventricular filling pressures (LVFPs), characterized by elevated natriuretic peptides or hemodynamic measurements. HFmrEF is sometimes referred to as heart failure with midrange ejection fraction in the literature. - **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)** : patients with an LVEF ≥50% with evidence of spontaneous or provokable increased left ventricular filling pressures (LVFPs), characterized by elevated natriuretic peptides or hemodynamic measurements.[1] The diagnosis of HFpEF can be challenging, particularly in patients with overt signs or symptoms of congestion.[6] However, approximately 50% of patients with heart failure are classified as HFpEF; not all patients with HFpEF will progress to HFrEF.[7][8] HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with many phenotypes, and the underlying pathophysiological processes of HFpEF differ from those of HFrEF.[9][10] While all patients with heart failure have ventricular diastolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction is considered part of the normal again process and is not synonymous with HFpEF.[11] Patients with HFpEF have increased rates of morbidity and mortality compared to patients without
