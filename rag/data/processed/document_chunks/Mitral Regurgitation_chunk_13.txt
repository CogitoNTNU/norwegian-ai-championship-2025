MR. A repeat transesophageal echocardiography is typically warranted to comprehend the underlying disease, identify residual leaflet anatomy for potential device implantation, and assess the risk of significant mitral stenosis. In case series with limited safety data, alternative interventional strategies for managing substantial para-clip or inter-clip residual MR have been explored. Examples include using an Amplatzer vascular plug (Abbott), originally designed for peripheral vasculature embolization, or an enlarged polytetrafluoroethylene double-disk occluder, initially intended for closing atrial septal defects.[38][72] According to a large multicenter registry, implant failure due to leaflet perforation, tear, or loss affects 3.5% of patients and is associated with increased in-hospital and long-term mortality.[73] Redo TEER is a viable option and may be preferable to surgery in anatomically suitable patients with primary or secondary MR, especially when surgical outcomes are suboptimal.[74] ## Clinical Significance Catheter management of MR represents a significant recent innovation, marking a considerable advancement in cardiology; it provides a corrective option for patients with severe MR and high surgical risks. Recent studies indicate that catheter management may, in certain circumstances, outperform surgical intervention.[20] Following mitral valve repair with the edge-to-edge device, left ventricle contractility and cardiac output remain stable, although total ejection fraction and global strain may decrease. This decline is likely attributable to a reduced regurgitant volume postrepair, leading to decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This reduction in myocardial oxygen demand can contribute to an improved New York Heart Association functional class after 3 months.[75] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Catheter management of mitral valve regurgitation demands a comprehensive approach from an interprofessional team to ensure patient-centered care, optimize outcomes, enhance patient safety, and improve team performance. Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals play pivotal roles in various aspects of this procedure. Physicians, particularly highly trained cardiovascular interventionalists, lead the procedural aspects. They collaborate with advanced practitioners to ensure thorough patient assessments and communicate risks and benefits effectively. Nurses specializing in cardiology are essential for preoperative, operative, and postoperative monitoring, patient education, and coordination of follow-up care. Interprofessional communication is facilitated by cardiovascular imaging specialists, structuralists, and anesthesiologists who contribute their expertise in optimizing lung and heart function, providing specialized imaging, and ensuring the patient's readiness for anesthesia. Pharmacists are crucial for pharmaceutical consultation, addressing postoperative pain management, antiemetics, and blood thinners. This multidisciplinary approach, driven by effective communication and care coordination, is vital for a successful catheter management procedure. Emphasizing this
