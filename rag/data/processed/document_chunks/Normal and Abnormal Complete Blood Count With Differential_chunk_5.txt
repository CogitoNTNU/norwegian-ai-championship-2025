granulomatous disease, autoimmune disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia, cigarette smoking, or medications. Monocytopenia, a decrease in the monocyte count, is observed in infection, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), aplastic anemia, lymphoproliferative disease (particularly hairy cell leukemia), or induced by medications. **Eosinophil count** The eosinophil count is the number of eosinophils per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 0% to 4% or 0 to 500 cells/µL. Eosinophilia, an increase in the eosinophil count, may be due to malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, parasitic infection (such as _Toxocara_ sp, Ascaris, _Strongyloides stercoralis_ , Schistosomiasis, Trichinella, Filariasis, Cysticercosis or Echinococcus), hypersensitivity reactions, connective tissue disease (such as polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis), atopic disease, skin disorders (such as psoriasis or scabies), idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, Loeffler syndrome, pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia, vasculitides (especially eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or induced by medications. Eosinopenia, a decrease in the eosinophil count, is seen in conditions such as acute stress, inflammation, or drug-induced (most notably glucocorticoids). **Basophil count** The basophil count is the number of basophils present per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 0.5% to 1% or 0 to 200 cells/µL. Basophillia, an increase in the basophil count, may be due to malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, endocrinopathy, viral infection, tuberculosis, chronic inflammatory disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis), allergy, anaphylaxis or drug-induced. Isolated basophilia is extremely uncommon and warrants workup to exclude a myeloproliferative process. Basopenia, a decrease in the basophil count, may be due to acute infection, hyperthyroidism, ovulation, or medications.[16][17] **Platelet Tests** **Platelet count** The platelet count is the amount of platelets per unit volume of blood and is expressed in cells per microliter of blood or cubic millimeter. The normal reference interval in adults is 150,000 to 400,000/μL or mm3. Platelet counts may appear low due to platelet clumping in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in blood specimen collection tubes, causing pseudo thrombocytopenia. Repeating the platelet count is recommended when a specimen is collected in a tube containing a different anticoagulant, such as citrate or oxalate.[15] Thrombocytopenia, a decrease in the platelet count, can be due
