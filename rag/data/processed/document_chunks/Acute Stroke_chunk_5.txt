its associated consequences. The clinical presentation of ICH varies depending on the size and location of the hemorrhage, with prevalent symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and headache.[16][36] Seizures typically occur at the onset of bleeding or within 24 hours. The incidence of acute seizures during the first 24 to 72 hours ranges from 4% to 42%.[37][38] Without neuroimaging, no clinical decision scale can differentiate ICH from other highly sensitive or specific conditions.[39] **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)** Similar to ICH, aneurysmal SAH usually occurs during routine activity, including rest or sleep, but it can also occur during physical activity.[40][41] SAH is most commonly characterized by a sudden and intense headache known as a "thunderclap headache," often described as "the most severe or worst headache ever experienced in life." Accompanying symptoms may include neck pain or stiffness, photophobia, vomiting, altered mental status, and loss of consciousness. Some patients may report a sentinel headache days or weeks before presentation. Furthermore, seizures may also occur during hemorrhage, hospitalization, or as a long-term complication of aneurysmal SAH.[34] Potential focal examination findings include unilateral vision loss, visuospatial neglect, ophthalmoplegia, and retinal, subhyaloid, and vitreous hemorrhage. Other possible findings include third and sixth nerve palsy, hemiparesis, aphasia, and abulia.[42] The neurological examination can be categorized using the Hunt-Hess scale or the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale.[34] ## Evaluation Neuroimaging is a critical component of stroke management, with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being the primary modalities.[43] According to the 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), it is recommended that all patients suspected of experiencing acute stroke should undergo emergency brain imaging evaluation upon arrival at the hospital before initiating any specific therapy to treat AIS. Noncontrast CT (NCCT) and MRI are considered appropriate modalities to exclude ICH before administering intravenous (IV) alteplase.[44] In cases where a patient with AIS presents within 6 hours of symptom onset and shows a small core infarct on NCCT, it is recommended to use CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) for guiding mechanical thrombectomy patient selection. Conversely, when a patient with AIS presents within the 6- to 24-hour window following symptom onset and displays a large-vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation, it is recommended to use diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) with or without MR perfusion or CT perfusion for evaluation.[45][46] For patients experiencing a "wake-up" stroke or with an uncertain time of symptom onset,
