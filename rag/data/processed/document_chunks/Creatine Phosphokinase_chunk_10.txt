wear facial protection and protective clothing to minimize the risk of exposure to blood or bodily fluids. They should also minimize syringe use and dispose of needles safely in rigid containers. After leaving the lab, they should remove all protective gear.[86] According to OSHA regulations, employees at risk of exposure should be offered the hepatitis B vaccine as part of their regular or occasional duties. Per the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, medical technologists, phlebotomists, and pathologists are recommended to receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Consequently, the obligation is to provide, at the very least, these laboratory employees with the choice to accept the hepatitis B vaccine at no cost.[87] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or creatine kinase (CK) is essential in diagnosing acute rhabdomyolysis or AMI and chronic conditions such as sickle cell disease. As such, several clinicians may provide their diagnostic interpretation of an individual patient. An interprofessional team consisting of a nephrologist, surgeon, and nurse may manage the condition in a patient who presents with rhabdomyolysis after an increased CK level. The nephrologist strives to improve kidney function in such patients, as acute kidney injury is the most common complication of rhabdomyolysis. The surgeon may need to surgically repair any damaged muscle or tissue that leads to the condition. The nurse should teach the patient about managing their condition and avoiding exacerbating or triggering rhabdomyolysis. The healthcare team can consult with the pharmacist to verify that any patient's medications are not potential sources for elevated CK.[88] Any hospital staff working in the emergency department should know that intravenous fluid therapy is started promptly to curb acute kidney injury in patients with suspected rhabdomyolysis.[89] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20105&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20105) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20105/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20105) [![Creatine Kinase Levels After a Myocardial Infarction](/books/NBK546624/bin/Creatine__kinase.gif)](/books/NBK546624/figure/article-20105.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK546624/figure/article-20105.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Creatine Kinase Levels After a Myocardial Infarction.
