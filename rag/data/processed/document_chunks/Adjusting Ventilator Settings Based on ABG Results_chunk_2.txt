and metabolic disorders. **Partial pressure of carbon dioxide** The PaCO2 measures the pressure of carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood. The normal PaCO2 range is 35 to 45 mm Hg. An elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg) indicates hypercapnia, commonly due to hypoventilation. Decreased PaCO2 (\<35 mm Hg) indicates hypocapnia, often from hyperventilation. PaCO2 is crucial for assessing the respiratory component of the acid-base balance. **Partial pressure of oxygen** The PaO2 measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood. The normal PaO2 range is 80 to 100 mm Hg. PaO2 is essential for evaluating oxygenation status. Low PaO2 (\<80 mm Hg) indicates hypoxemia, which can result from various respiratory disorders. **Bicarbonate** HCO3- is a base that helps buffer the bloodâ€™s pH. The normal HCO3- range is 22 to 26 mmol/L. HCO3- levels reflect the metabolic component of the acid-base balance. Increased HCO3- indicates metabolic alkalosis, while decreased HCO3- indicates metabolic acidosis. **Base excess** Base excess (BE) measures the amount of excess or deficient base in the blood. The normal range is -2 to +2 mmol/L. A positive BE indicates metabolic alkalosis, while a negative BE indicates metabolic acidosis. BE helps assess the metabolic component of acid-base disorders.[8] **Basic Interpretation of ABG Results** ABG analysis is crucial in assessing and managing acid-base imbalance. The body compensates through respiratory or metabolic adjustments to restore balance. Information from ABG analysis helps determine the kind and severity of imbalance, guiding treatment. **Acidosis vs alkalosis** Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH and a high PaCO2. The causes of this condition include hypoventilation from conditions such as respiratory depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neuromuscular disorders. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by low pH and HCO3-. Causes may include conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and renal failure. Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a high pH and a low PaCO2. Causes include hyperventilation due to conditions such as anxiety, pain, and hypoxemia. Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by high pH and HCO3-. Possible etiologies include vomiting, diuretic use, and hypokalemia. **Compensation mechanisms** The respiratory system adjusts ventilation to correct metabolic acid-base disturbances (respiratory compensation). An example is increasing ventilation to decrease PaCO2 in metabolic acidosis. Meanwhile, the kidneys adjust bicarbonate reabsorption and hydrogen ion excretion to correct respiratory acid-base disturbances (metabolic compensation). An example is increasing HCO3- reabsorption in chronic respiratory acidosis.[9] ## Issues of Concern **Adjusting Ventilator Settings Based on Arterial Blood Gas Analysis
