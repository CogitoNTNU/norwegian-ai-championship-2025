naloxone. Many street opiate preparations are adulterated, and the response to naloxone may not always be complete. A steady naloxone infusion is generally preferred over intermittent dosing for treating large overdoses. However, a naloxone infusion should not be administered if intubation is necessary.[34][35][36] Clinicians must be ready to intubate if the patient remains in respiratory distress. **Role of activated charcoal** Activated charcoal may be used to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in cases of oral opiate overdose, such as with body stuffers, if the patient is alert at the time of admission. Activated charcoal is typically effective only if administered within 1 hour of drug ingestion. However, opiates slow gastric motility, allowing activated charcoal to be given up to 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Activated charcoal should be considered for all patients with opiate overdose in the absence of contraindications, such as vomiting and decreased mental status. Activated charcoal should not be administered to patients with depressed mental status or any individual with airway concerns. Patients should not be intubated solely to administer activated charcoal. **Bowel irrigation** Whole bowel irrigation may be considered for individuals who have ingested drug packets containing opiates, as in the case of a body packer. However, no controlled studies confirm that this treatment offers any benefits or improves outcomes. Whole bowel irrigation is not recommended for patients showing signs of ileus, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or an unprotected airway. **Additional measures** Some patients with opiate toxicity may not respond to high-dose naloxone treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that buprenorphine may be beneficial if the cause is determined to be an opiate and the patient is in respiratory arrest. **Intranasal administration of naloxone** Naloxone is highly effective when administered promptly, but its use has traditionally been limited to physicians and paramedics. With the rise in opioid overdoses, intranasal medication administration by bystanders is currently being advocated. Evidence supporting the efficacy of out-of-hospital naloxone administration is promising. The bioavailability of concentrated naloxone nasal spray has been shown to be around 25%. Fifty percent absorption occurs within 6 to 8 minutes, with maximum blood concentration reached at 20 minutes, making it a viable option for community and prehospital use. A retrospective study of Basic Life Support (BLS) crews administering prehospital intranasal naloxone over 6 years found that 95% of patients who received treatment showed clinical benefits before arrival. Less than 10% of patients required additional doses in the
