The blush response in the hand is noted, and if the color in the palm returns before 10 seconds, the blood supply to the hand via the ulnar artery and palmar arch is considered satisfactory. Barbeau test removes the subjectivity of the Allen test, and a pulse oximeter is placed on the ipsilateral thumb. Similar to the Allen test, compression of both the arteries is performed until the pulse oximetry trace is blunted. The test is considered normal if the pulse oximetry tracing returns to normal within 10 seconds of releasing the pressure on the ulnar artery. **Transradial versus Transfemoral Approaches** Since its first description in 1989, a transradial approach for coronary angiography has been increasing compared to the transfemoral approach. Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated reduced mortality, decreased major bleeding, access site complications, reduced length of stay, and comparable stroke rates using a transradial approach.[4] The findings have been reproduced in non-emergency diagnostic and percutaneous interventional procedures and as well as in urgent settings of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Radial access procedures also enhance patient comfort, reduce post-procedure bed rest and eventually length of hospital stay. ## Complications The risk of major complications during diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure is usually less than 1%, and the risk and the risk of mortality of 0.05% for diagnostic procedures.[5] For any patient, the complication rate is dependent on multiple factors and is dependent on the demographics of the patient, vascular anatomy, co-morbid conditions, clinical presentation, the procedure being performed, and the experience of the operator. The complications can be minor as discomfort at the site of catheterization, to major ones like death. **Local Vascular Complications** \*\*_Hematoma/Retroperitoneal Bleeding_ \*\* These are among the most common complications seen after cardiac catheterization procedures. Hematomas are usually formed following poorly controlled hemostasis post sheath removal. Most hematomas are self-limiting and benign, but large, rapidly expanding hematomas can cause hemodynamic instability requiring resuscitation with fluids and blood. The incidence of this complication is significantly reduced in transradial access. In patients with transfemoral access, retroperitoneal bleeding should be suspected if there is a sudden change in the patient's hemodynamic stability with or without back pain, as there may not be any visible swelling in the groin for some of these patients. The incidence of this complication is less than 0.2%.[6] Strong clinical suspicion along with immediate imaging, usually with a CT scan, helps make a
