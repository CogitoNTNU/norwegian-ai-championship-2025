given if the onset of symptoms is less than 12 hours (class I) or the onset of symptoms is 12 to 24 hours, but there is clinical evidence of ongoing ischemia with potential for large myocardium damage or hemodynamic instability. If a patient develops cardiogenic shock or has refractory heart failure after receiving thrombolytic therapy, they should be transferred for immediate angiography and possible PCI. A patient may also require transfer for immediate angiography and possible PCI if there is evidence of failed reperfusion or re-occlusion of the infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy. For stable patients who have received successful thrombolysis, elective PCI can be considered between 3 and 24 hours after thrombolysis to assess further and treat the coronary artery. **Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy for** **patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy** : 1. **Aspirin** : - Loading dose: 162 to 325 mg - Maintenance dose: 81 to 325 mg maintenance dose 1. **Clopidogrel** : - Loading dose for age \<75: 300 mg loading dose - Maintenance dose for age \<75: 75 mg maintenance. - Loading dose for age >75: no loading dose - Maintenance dose for age>75: 75 mg daily for 14 days and up to 1 year 1. **Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)** : - Maintain aPTT 1.5 to 2 times of control - Based on the age and renal function, enoxaparin may be considered. **Anticoagulation** : Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after thrombolysis and during PCI is necessary to prevent thrombosis. In patients undergoing PCI, UFH boluses should be administered to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), taking into consideration whether Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is being used. Alternatively, bivalirudin can be used as an anticoagulant during PCI. However, fondaparinux should not be used as a sole anticoagulant in STEMI. **Beta-blocker** : Administer oral beta-blockers in patients without contraindications, especially in tachyarrhythmia or hypertension. Beta-blockers are commonly used to manage acute MI for several beneficial effects, such as reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, prevention of reinfarction, antiarrhythmic effects, and improvement of left ventricular function. **High-intensity statin therapy:** To manage AMI, patients without contraindications should be prescribed high-intensity statin therapy, such as atorvastatin 80 mg. **Adjunctive therapy:** Adjunctive therapy plays a crucial role in managing AMI. These include: - **P2Y12 inhibitors** : medications such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, are antiplatelet agents that help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. These are
