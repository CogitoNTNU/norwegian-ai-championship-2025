management, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight. This involves regular lipid monitoring, dietary counseling, and smoking cessation support, as smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and increases the risk of dissection. - Screening for connective tissue disorders - Individuals with a family history of connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) or genetic predispositions should undergo regular cardiovascular screening. Identifying these conditions early allows for tailored monitoring and preventive strategies, such as early elective surgical intervention in cases of progressive aortic dilation. **Patient Awareness of Symptoms** Early recognition of AAD symptoms is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. Patients should be educated to recognize and respond promptly to symptoms, including: - Patients should understand that sudden, severe chest or back pain—often described as tearing or ripping—is a hallmark symptom of AAD and warrants immediate medical attention. - They should be aware that symptoms such as sudden loss of consciousness, stroke-like symptoms, or limb weakness may indicate an aortic dissection involving branch vessels, necessitating urgent evaluation. - Awareness of symptoms like shortness of breath, new onset of heart murmur, or signs of limb ischemia can be vital for early detection. Encouraging patients to seek emergency care rather than waiting or self-medicating is essential for improving outcomes. **Medical Therapy Adherence and Long-term Monitoring** For patients with known aortic aneurysms or those at risk for AAD, long-term management and monitoring are key to preventing progression and complications: - Medication adherence - Beta-blockers are frequently prescribed to patients at risk for AAD to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress. Patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to their prescribed medications and understanding the rationale behind each medication to enhance compliance. - Lifestyle adjustments - Physical activities that significantly increase blood pressure or cause Valsalva maneuvers (eg, heavy lifting and competitive sports) should be avoided, especially in patients with a known aortic aneurysm or prior dissection. Moderate exercise, such as walking, is encouraged only after consulting with a healthcare provider. - Regular follow-up and imaging - Patients with connective tissue disorders or aortic aneurysms should have routine follow-ups and periodic imaging (eg, echocardiograms or CT/MRI) to monitor aortic size and integrity. Education should include the frequency and importance of these follow-ups, even without symptoms. **Genetic Counseling and Screening** For individuals with a family history of AAD or related connective tissue disorders, genetic counseling is crucial: - First-degree relatives of patients with a
