weeks to elective surgery for patients who initially underwent temporizing measures for obstructed left-sided colon cancer. In the study, 38 patients underwent intervention before and 56 after 4 weeks, and those with the longer wait time had improved overall survival.[47] Kwaan et al. studied the effect of time-to-intervention for a large bowel obstruction on morbidity and mortality in a group who were admitted and underwent a procedure consisting of colectomy, stoma, or stenting within 2 days of hospital admission. The authors found that quick intervention resulted in shorter hospital stays but did not impact mortality in their cohort.[18] ## Prognosis In 2023, Eugene et al. created a model for the prediction of 30-day mortality after surgery for acute abdomen, including colon obstruction, based on 13 preoperative characteristics. These factors include age, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory history, biochemical markers, predicted diagnosis of malignancy, predicted intraoperative contamination, ASA status, and indication for surgery. The model was designed to facilitate treatment discussions and help reduce morbidity and mortality.[48] Emergency intervention for malignant obstruction reduces long-term survival, and obstructed malignancy is associated with worse overall survival compared to non-obstructed malignancy.[6] Reported mortality for emergency surgery for obstructed colorectal cancer is greater than 11%. Factors associated with a poor outcome include age older than 70, right-sided obstruction, a significant departure from ideal body weight, sepsis, and elevated creatinine. Chronic diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are associated with poor prognoses.[5] In a study involving 30,000 patients admitted with large bowel obstruction, those with a benign process had the highest inpatient mortality.[18] ## Complications Large bowel obstruction can lead to numerous complications, either from the obstruction itself or attempted intervention. Potential issues include perforation, bleeding, fistula formation, and ischemia.[35] Perforation may occur from excessive distension or as the result of instrumentation. According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, a perforation caused by stent placement is reported to occur between 2% and 9%. In addition to gross perforations, occult or micro-perforations may occur with the possible dissemination of malignancy.[33] Surgical site infections are common following emergency surgery for colon obstruction, and colostomy reversal is associated with anastomotic leak, with a reported mortality of 8.3%.[5][49] ## Consultations Providing care for a patient with a large bowel obstruction requires collaboration among various specialties, including gastroenterology, interventional radiology, medical and surgical oncology, and colorectal surgery. ## Deterrence and Patient Education An increasing incidence of
