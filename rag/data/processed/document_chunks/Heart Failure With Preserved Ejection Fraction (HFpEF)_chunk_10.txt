kidney disease - Coronary artery disease - Diabetes - Hypertension - Overweight/obesity [1] Diagnostic algorithms such as the HFA-PEFF (Heart Failure Association. **P** retest Assessment, **E** chocardiography and natriuretic peptide, **F** unctional testing, **F** inal etiology) and H2FPEF (**H** eavy, **2** or more hypertensive drugs, atrial **F** ibrillation, **P** ulmonary hypertension, **E** lder older than 60, elevated **F** illing pressures) have been developed and evaluated to identify HFpEF noninvasively. Additional testing, such as echocardiography and measurement of natriuretic peptides, is required to apply these algorithms and confirm a diagnosis of HFpEF.[60] An evidence-based diagnostic approach to patients with suspected HFpEF is outlined in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure.[1] For patients presenting with a sign or symptom of HFpEF, additional testing is recommended to establish the diagnosis and, if possible, the specific etiology; the presence of underlying comorbidities should also be determined and documented (see **Image.** Flowsheet). **Initial Evaluation: Laboratory Testing** **Complete blood count:** Anemia is an established risk factor for heart failure and negatively affects clinical outcomes; the negative impact is inversely proportional to the hemoglobin level.[62] **Serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium:** Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are strong adverse prognostic indicators in patients with heart failure.[63] **Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen:** Chronic kidney disease is an established risk factor for heart failure and negatively affects clinical outcomes; the negative impact is inversely proportional to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).[62] **Serum glucose:** Diabetes is a common comorbidity and an underlying risk factor for the development of HFpEF.[18] **Fasting lipid profile:** Multiple recent studies have suggested that dysregulation of lipid metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, HFpEF may alter lipid metabolism, and hypertriglyceridemia may increase the risk of mortality and rehospitalization in patients with HFpEF.[61][64][65] **Liver function tests:** Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; previously nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD) has been closely demonstrated to increase the development and progression of HFpEF.[66] It has been proposed that several MASLD-associated HFpEF phenotypes are commonly encountered in clinical practice.[66] **Iron studies, including serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation:** Intravenous iron therapy in symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with heart failure has been shown to improve functional status and quality of life and reduce hospitalizations for worsening heart failure.[67] **Thyroid-stimulating hormone:** Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states are underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure, and low triiodothyronine syndrome is commonly encountered in patients with
