underlying pathophysiological processes of HFpEF differ from those of HFrEF.[9][10] While all patients with heart failure have ventricular diastolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction is considered part of the normal again process and is not synonymous with HFpEF.[11] Patients with HFpEF have increased rates of morbidity and mortality compared to patients without heart failure.[1] However, therapeutic interventions are available to reduce symptoms, improve functional status and quality of life, and reduce hospital admission rates.[12] Clinical understanding of HFpEF continues to evolve, and clinical trials to improve outcomes for patients with HFpEF are ongoing. ## Etiology Heart failure is the common endpoint for many disease processes.[3] Worldwide, the most common underlying etiology of heart failure is ischemic heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, which confers a relative risk of heart failure of 8.1.[13] Independent risk factors for the development of heart failure as identified during the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study include male sex, cigarette smoking, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and valvular disease.[13] Social determinants of health, such as education, occupation, and income, also contribute to the development of heart failure.[14][15] **Predisposing Conditions for Primary Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** The risk factors, underlying etiologies, and pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF differ significantly; HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.[16] Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for all heart failure subtypes; aging significantly influences the development of HFpEF more than HFrEF.[17][18] However, individuals younger than 65 can develop HFpEF; this may represent a unique age-based phenotype.[9] This same increased influence is seen for atrial fibrillation, female sex, and pulmonary hypertension of any etiology.[18] Obesity and diabetes are also significant risk factors and predictors of HFpEF.[18] Patients with HFpEF and obesity tend to be younger than patients with HFpEF and an average body mass index.[19] While arterial hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of HFpEF across all populations, obesity is a disproportionately substantial risk factor for patients who identify as African American or Hispanic.[20] HFpEF is rarely due to a single identifiable clinical condition but arises in patients with various risk factors; the predominant risk factor may or may not indicate a specific phenotype of HFpEFâ€”thus, the heterogeneity of the disease.[16] Risk factors for the development of HFpEF appear to include but are not limited to: - Increasing age - Female sex - Type 2 diabetes - Obesity - Sleep apnea -
