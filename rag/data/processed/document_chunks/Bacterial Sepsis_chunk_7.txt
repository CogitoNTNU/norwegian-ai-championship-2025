include active cancer, diabetes, chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and liver disease(cirrhosis). Age, specifically older than 65 years old, has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis. This is because of the association of increasing age with a decrease in the adaptive immune system, with B and T cells showing impaired functionality. Alternatively, gender does not seem to play a role in sepsis mortality, as studies focusing on this subject are conflicting.[19] The presence of any of these comorbidities should heighten the suspicion of the patient developing sepsis and prompt an earlier intervention if possible. Gathering information geared toward finding an infectious source will help tailor further intervention and management. Notably, a patient’s recent history, hospitalization, and exposure to drug-resistant organisms may help direct what treatment to initiate. Retrospectively, sources of infection have been shown to be in the order of prevalence: pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections.[1] However, the mortality rate is not related to the site of infection or the causative organism, including multi-drug-resistant organisms.[20] Even with this caveat, finding a suspected source of infection is critical in the early stages of a patient’s presentation. The physical portion of the exam will provide critically important vital signs, allowing for the utilization of clinical screening tools. There has been criticism of utilizing the SIRS criteria for this purpose because its specificity in sepsis remains low. However, the basic tenets of observing vital sign abnormalities and systemic response to infection remain valid. The differences and reliability of these clinical scores are discussed in further detail below. Clinical conditions that are associated with inflammatory injury are best grouped as organ systems related to their condition in order of prevalence: - Lungs manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), - Cardiovascular as septic shock (hypotension) - Kidneys as acute kidney injury (AKI) - Brain as septic encephalopathy - Bone marrow as anemia of critical illness - Skeletal muscle as critical illness myopathy - Peripheral nerves as critical illness polyneuropathy The physical exam should be focused on quickly assessing the patient with initial vitals and, if there is suspicion for sepsis, a thorough physical exam looking for a potential infectious source, including a pelvic exam if indicated. ## Evaluation With the increased emphasis placed on earlier detection of sepsis, several clinical scores have been proposed to help further predict which patients are septic and which
