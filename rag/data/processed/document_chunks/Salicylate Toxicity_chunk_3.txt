synaptic cleft. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and stimulates its carrier-mediated release into synapses. Like other amphetamine analogs, MDMA also inhibits monoamine oxidase activity, which further contributes to increased serotonin levels (in addition to dopamine and norepinephrine). Like serotonin, MDMA affects dopamine transporters by promoting release and inhibiting reuptake. The binding of noradrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors contributes to the noradrenaline, histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine effects of the drug. The activity on post-synaptic receptors plays a role in mood, thermoregulation, and the autonomic nervous system.[5][6] The desired effects of the drug include sympathomimetic arousal, sensual enhancement, feelings of euphoria, and emotional closeness to others. Other effects include nausea, trismus, and bruxism. These effects are attributable to the increased circulation of dopamine and serotonin. Blood pressure and heart rate elevations are secondary to the adrenergic effects of increased circulating norepinephrine acting on α, β-1, and β-2 receptors.[14][15] In addition to its effects on neurotransmitters, MDMA increases the levels of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), leading to fluid retention. This effect, coupled with excessive water intake, is implicated in the development of life-threatening hyponatremia and coma.[16] ## Toxicokinetics When ingested, MDMA is readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract with an onset between 20 minutes and 1 hour and peak concentrations occurring at 2 hours. MDMA is primarily metabolized hepatically through CYP2D6. The elimination half-life of MDMA is moderately slow at about 8 hours. MDMA takes about 40 hours (ie, 5 half-lives) to achieve over 95% drug clearance. Since some metabolites of MDMA are pharmacologically active, such as MDA, the duration of clinical effects may continue after clearance from the body.[6][17][18] ## History and Physical The presentation of acute MDMA toxicity is similar to amphetamines and includes tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. However, MDMA has less stimulant and more serotonergic effects compared to amphetamines and methamphetamines.[19] At low doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity, such as bruxism, restless legs, jaw clenching, hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness.[14] Significant life-threatening complications include serotonin syndrome, cardiac dysrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages.[8][20][21] Since MDMA undergoes metabolism via hepatic CYP2D6, severe hepatoxicity may occur, leading to fulminant liver failure.[22] Central nervous system (CNS) hyperactivity can lead to agitated delirium and seizures.[23][24] Because MDMA is a popular rave drug, the combination of intense physical activity with the sympathomimetic effects
