Testicular torsion is a true urologic emergency, and early identification is critical to prevent the need for testicular amputation. Ultrasound is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate the scrotal contents. This activity will review the most common causes of testicular torsion, the common presenting signs and symptoms, and the treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating testicular torsion. **Objectives:** - Describe the epidemiology of testicular torsion. - Outline the presenting signs and symptoms of testicular torsion. - Summarize considerations that influence the management of testicular torsion. - Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of testicular torsion and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.

Testicular torsion is a time-dependent diagnosis, a true urologic emergency, and early evaluation can assist in urologic intervention to prevent testicular loss. Ultrasound is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate the scrotal contents. [1][2][3] Testicular viability significantly decreases 6 hours after the onset of symptoms; hence, early diagnosis is key. Testicular torsion is most common in young people but rarely may be seen in older individuals. Surgery is the only treatment. ## Etiology The majority of cases occur in younger patients (< 25 years old) and are usually due to a congenital abnormality of the processus vaginalis. The history of onset may be spontaneous, exertional, or, in fewer instances, associated with trauma. Testicular torsion accounts for a significant number of scrotal complaints that present to the emergency department. Testicular torsion is caused by the twisting of the blood supply and spermatic cord. The tunica vaginalis is usually solidly adhered to the posterolateral aspect of the testicle, and within it, the spermatic cord is not mobile. If the attachment of the tunica vaginalis is
