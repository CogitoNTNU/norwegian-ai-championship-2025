also have an important role in patient education. To prevent blunt abdominal trauma, the public has to be educated on wearing a safety belt. These safety devices have to be worn even if the motor vehicle comes fitted with airbags. More importantly, the public must be educated about defensive driving and maintaining a safe distance from other automobiles on the road. Plus, the public should be told about the consequences of drinking and driving. Finally, the nurse and the pharmacist should educate the public on avoiding distractions in the car, like eating, texting, or using a mobile phone.[14][15] [Level 5] **Outcomes** In the past two decades, the outcomes of blunt abdominal trauma have improved. However, there are very few papers published on long-term data, and hence, the eventual outcome of these patients remains unknown. For patients with minor blunt trauma, the outcomes are good, but for those who suffer multiple organ injuries, the in-hospital mortality can vary from 3% to 10%. The ready availability of CT scans has also allowed physicians to closely monitor these patients without performing unnecessary surgeries.[16][17][18] [Level 2] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17020&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17020) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/injury-safety-and-violence/blunt-abdominal-trauma-abdomen-injury/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17020) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17020/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17020) ## References 1.
