the carina. Pulmonary Ligament (station 9) They are located within the pulmonary ligaments extending from the inferior pulmonary vein up to the diaphragm. **Hilar Lymph Nodes (Station 10 to 14)** These are all N1 nodes. These include nodes adjacent to the main stem bronchus and hilar vessels. On the right, they extend from the lower rim of the azygos vein to the interlobar region. On the left, from the upper rim of the pulmonary artery to the inter-lobar region. **Lymph Node Classification (N)** N0: No lymph node involvement N1: Involvement of ipsilateral hilar nodes - N1a: single station N1 nodes - N1b: multiple-station N1 nodes N2: Involvement of mediastinal nodes - N2a1: Single station N2 nodes without N1 involvement (skip metastasis) - N2a2: Single station N2 nodes with N1 involvement - N2b: Multiple station N2 involvement N3: Involvement of contralateral mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes[41] **Metastasis (M)** - M0: No distant metastasis - M1a: Malignant pleural / pericardial effusion or nodules - M1b: Single extra-thoracic metastasis - M2: Multiple extra-thoracic metastases **Tumor Node Metastasis Staging of Lung Cancer** Occult cancer: TX N0 M0 Primary cancer not found; no lymph node or distant metastasis.
