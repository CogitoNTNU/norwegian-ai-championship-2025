broad-spectrum antibiotics and completion of a 3-hour bundle. This has some prognostic value attached to it, as completion of the intravenous fluid bolus was not shown to affect mortality.[27] Clinical scores such as the qSOFA and SIRS scores have been able to be applied in early settings, with worsening scores corresponding to greater in-hospital mortality.[21][22] For patients requiring ICU-level care, the SOFA score has been shown to be the best predictor for in-hospital mortality.[38] Using the prognostic implications from these clinical scores can help with discussing goals of care as recommended by recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.[8] The large majority of clinical trials and interventions involving sepsis and septic shock address relatively short-term outcomes, typically 28 day in-hospital mortality. Long-term mortality data with respect to many of the interventions already discussed above is lacking. Mortality following hospitalization from sepsis is high, with rates reported around 31% in the first year and nearing 43% by year 2.[39] Recognized long-term complications of patients with sepsis include critical illness weakness, delirium, and acute lung injury, which have a greater impact on morbidity and mortality outside of the first 28 days.[40] Other investigations into late predictors of mortality suggest a pro-inflammatory state of accelerated atherosclerosis and chronic immunosuppression that also contributes to the high mortality rate seen in these patients.[41] Despite advances in sepsis management resulting in an improvement in short-term mortality, the prognosis for patients surviving sepsis still remains poor, with overall mortality rates remaining seemingly unaffected. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Over 100 years of data show improved patient outcomes, regardless of the disease process, when healthcare professionals collaborate, acting as an interprofessional team.[42] The treatment and management of sepsis and septic shock, especially as the condition progresses, involves nearly every aspect of healthcare. With the implementation of bundled care, communication between physicians, nursing staff, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists becomes more important as these interventions must be implemented swiftly and correctly. With later identification of sepsis resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, emphasis on earlier recognition algorithms has been studied in multiple interprofessional trials. In one such trial using ancillary staff and then emergency nursing staff in the early identification of sepsis, there was an increased staff knowledge of sepsis, decreased emergency department length of stay, and a statistically significant decrease in mortality.[43] Other similar studies showed a greater distribution of responsibility in the management of these complex patients from physicians to
