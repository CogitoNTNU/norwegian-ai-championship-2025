specialist. While the primary care team can meet most primary palliative care needs, consultation with social workers, case management, or palliative care specialists may become necessary to identify barriers to adequate care and provide patient- and family-specific support. Evidence supports improved quality of life and decreased hospitalizations in patients with heart failure who receive care at a high-volume heart failure center.[95] ## Deterrence and Patient Education All patients with HFpEF should receive counseling and education that emphasizes compliance with dietary and medical therapies; dietary and medical noncompliance are the most common causes of hospital readmission in patients with heart failure.[96] Additionally, improvement in healthcare literacy is associated with a decreased need for emergency care due to heart failure exacerbations.[96] Although single-session educational interventions offer the same benefits as multisession interventions for most patients with heart failure, patients with lower levels of healthcare literacy may benefit from multisession interventions.[97] Free, printable patient education handout materials are available here: [What is Heart Failure?](https://www.veteranshealthlibrary.va.gov/Search/3,82055) A discussion of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF explaining LVEF and the signs and symptoms of heart failure.
