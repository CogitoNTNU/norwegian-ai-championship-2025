to fallopian tubal damage.[8] Cilia beat frequency is also negatively affected by smoking and infection. Hormonal variations throughout the menstrual cycle additionally have demonstrated effects on cilia beat frequency.[8] ## Histopathology The most common site for ectopic pregnancy adherence is in the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.[8] Reportedly, 95% of ectopic pregnancies develop in the ampulla, infundibular, and isthmic portions of the fallopian tubes.[9] Villus-like structures, trophoblasts, or an embryo in the fallopian tube or other ectopic sites on histological examination are diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy.[10] In ovarian ectopic pregnancy cases, Spiegelberg histology criteria are frequently used to differentiate this type of ectopic pregnancy from other ectopic locations.[11] Spiegelberg's criteria include the 4 following findings: 1. An intact fallopian tube distinct from the ovary on the side of the ectopic pregnancy 1. A gestational sac replacing the ovary's position 1. The ovary containing the gestational sac is connected to the uterus by the ovarian ligament 1. The specimen has ovarian tissue attached to and within the wall of the gestational sac [11] With cesarean scar pregnancies, a migration of blastocyst into the myometrium is noted due to residual scarring defects from prior cesarean deliveries.[12] Histological findings of cesarean pregnancy included myometrial or scar tissue villous invasion with minimal decidua.[5] The depth of implantation determines the type of cesarean scar pregnancy, with type 1 having proximity to the uterine wall and type 2 implanting closer to the urinary bladder.[12] ## History and Physical **Clinical History** Ectopic pregnancies within the adnexa typically present with variable pain that typically starts as colicky abdominal or pelvic discomfort, often localized to one side, though clinicians should be aware that not all ectopic pregnancies have this characteristic presentation. For tubal ectopic pregnancies, as the fallopian tube distends, the pain may become more generalized if rupture and hemoperitoneum occur. Additional symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, nausea and vomiting, shoulder pain, urinary symptoms, or rectal pressure.[1] Therefore, women of childbearing age presenting with these symptoms should be evaluated.[6] Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies can range from asymptomatic presentations during routine obstetrical ultrasound to uterine rupture.[5] Clinicians should also identify the patient's last menstrual period and whether they have monthly routine menstrual periods. A missed last period, abnormal uterine bleeding, or sexual activity are suggestive of a possible pregnancy and, therefore, are also indications for further testing with a pregnancy test.[6] Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy should also be
