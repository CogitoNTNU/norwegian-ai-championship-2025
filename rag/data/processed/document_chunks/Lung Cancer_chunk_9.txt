node sampling, a PET scan may be falsely positive. False-negative PET scans occur when there is impaired blood flow and low metabolic activity, such as with carcinoid tumors and some adenocarcinomas, and smaller lymph nodes. PET scan has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 88%, which is higher than CT but not sufficient to stage lung cancer independently. Therefore, the ACCP recommends that a positive PET does not obviate the need for lymph node sampling except for group A disease. **Invasive Staging[32]** After CT and PET scans, the next step is to obtain tissue or pathologic confirmation of malignancy, confirm the staging and histological differentiation of cancer. One of the following procedures achieves this. - Bronchoscopic endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) - Endoscopic-TBNA - Mediastinoscopy - Thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopy(VATS) A CT-guided transthoracic biopsy is an option for peripheral lesions with a low risk of pneumothorax. Certain older procedures, such as the Chamberlain procedure, are sometimes required.[33] **Bronchoscopic TBNA** - Convex probe-endobronchial ultrasound-guided (CP-EBUS)-TBNA - Radial probe-EBUS-TBNA (RP-EBUS) - Navigation bronchoscopy **CP-EBUS Bronchoscopy** This is a bronchoscopic technique in which a miniature convex ultrasound of 7.5 MHZ is attached to the tip of the bronchoscope. It provides direct visualization of structures in the mediastinum or lung parenchyma through the bronchial wall. A biopsy is performed in real-time. It is mainly used to sample the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. The image can be frozen and measured, and there is also a Doppler available to identify blood vessels. It is the procedure of choice for this purpose. CP-EBUS is also the procedure of choice postinduction chemotherapy before surgery to confirm complete remission. CP-EBUS can be used to sample upper and lower paratracheal nodes as well as stations 10, 11, and 12. Stations 3, 5, and 6 are not accessible via CP-EBUS. **RP-EBUS Bronchoscopy** Instead of a convex probe, there is a miniature (20 to 30 MHz) probe. The advantages are that smaller lesions or more peripheral lesions can be reached, and it provides a 360-degree view of lung parenchyma. A real-time biopsy cannot be performed. **Navigation Bronchoscopy** The concept is to construct a navigational map of airways using either a CT scan or an electromagnetic field. After the map is constructed, the software creates the path to reach the location of the nodule. The bronchoscopist can create the pathway, and the software then navigates the bronchoscopist to the biopsy site.
