concern for mesenteric ischemia and aortic dissection The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines that help healthcare professionals determine the best imaging or treatment for a patient. Clinicians can access the criteria at the American College of Radiology's website: <https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Clinical-Tools-and-Reference/Appropriateness-Criteria>. **Children** The evaluation of abdominal pain in children follows a similar approach to adults but requires specific considerations. Clinicians must exclude malrotation, a surgical emergency, in a child younger than 1 who presents with bilious vomiting. Children with abdominal pain and pharyngitis should undergo rapid strep testing. Healthcare professionals infrequently use CT scans of the abdomen in children due to the risks associated with radiation exposure. For children presenting with bilious vomiting, severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, or signs of peritonitis, an abdominal radiograph is usually the initial diagnostic step. This imaging modality swiftly detects perforation through the presence of free air and identifies bowel obstruction by revealing air-fluid levels and distended bowel loops. Ultrasound effectively visualizes intussusception, whereas a contrast enema can diagnose and treat intussusception. An upper gastrointestinal contrast series remains the imaging study of choice for malrotation with volvulus. Children who present with classic signs of appendicitis should undergo evaluation by a pediatric surgeon before undergoing imaging. If the presentation is atypical or the examination findings are unclear, imaging with abdominal ultrasound is preferred. Children with suspected necrotizing enterocolitis should undergo abdominal radiographs, which reveal pneumatosis intestinalis. Some centers use ultrasonography, which shows free air, focal fluid collections, increased bowel wall thickness, and echogenicity.[[34]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173893#ref_23771727) Infants with necrotizing enterocolitis also warrant a sepsis evaluation, CBC, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose levels. Persistent hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis all indicate necrotic bowel and sepsis.[[35]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173893#ref_16567195) Clinicians can follow serum lactate levels to monitor disease progression and improvement. ## Treatment / Management Clinicians initiate resuscitation alongside the initial evaluation, not delaying specialty consultation while awaiting imaging results.[34] They promptly attach patients to a cardiac monitor and treat those with peritonitis, hypotension, or a toxic appearance by establishing large-bore IV access, administering crystalloid fluids, and using vasopressors for septic shock. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or chronic glucocorticoid use receive stress-dose steroids, and patients with evidence of hypovolemia and hemorrhage receive blood products. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic enteric organisms are necessary when infection, peritoneal contamination, or sepsis is suspected. Healthcare professionals should remember that adequate pain management is essential and does not alter the assessment.[35] Potential
