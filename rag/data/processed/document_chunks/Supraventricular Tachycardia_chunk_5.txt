(VOP) is a crucial technique for differentiating various types of SVT. To ensure accurate interpretation, specific conditions must be met during the maneuver, including: - Ventricular pacing is performed at a rate 10 to 30 milliseconds faster than the TCL, and it must be confirmed that the atrial rate advances to match the ventricular pacing rate. - The same tachycardia should continue after pacing stops. - No significant fluctuations, or “wobbles,” in the TCL should be present during pacing. When these criteria are fulfilled, the maneuver’s results can be interpreted based on 2 key features, described below: - **Cessation response** - After the conclusion of ventricular overdrive pacing (VOP), the final atrial beat that has been advanced to the pacing cycle length is identified and represents the initial “A” in the cessation response. The pattern of this response helps distinguish the type of supraventricular tachycardia, as mentioned below. - In AVNRT and AVRT, an A-(H)-V response is observed. - In atrial tachycardia (AT), an A-A-(H)-V response is observed. - This response reflects the underlying mechanism of tachycardia. In both AVNRT and AVRT, atrial activation during ventricular pacing occurs via the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit, leaving the anterograde limb available for conduction. As a result, the last retrograde atrial beat (A) from the final ventricular (V) pacing stimulus triggers the subsequent His bundle (H) and ventricular (V) activation, producing the characteristic A–H–V response. - On the other hand, during atrial tachycardia, ventricular pacing renders the AV conduction pathway immediately refractory, so the last retrograde atrial (A) beat from the final ventricular pacing stimulus is not conducted to the ventricle. Therefore, when overdrive pacing stops, the first beat of the atrial tachycardia initiates AV conduction, resulting in an A–A–H–V response (see **Image.** Ventricular Overdrive Pacing Responses in Atrial Tachycardia). - **Quantification in arrhythmia diagnosis** - Additional measurements are essential to differentiate between the mechanisms underlying an A-(H)-V response seen in AVNRT or AVRT. Specifically, the difference between the PPI and the TCL (referred to as PPI−TCL) can provide valuable insight. - The PPI is measured from the last ventricular pacing stimulus to the return of the next ventricular beat at the same site. Generally, the closer the tachycardia circuit is to the ventricular pacing site, the smaller the PPI−TCL value will be. To distinguish between orthodromic AVRT and AVNRT, a value of less than 115 milliseconds indicates a higher likelihood
