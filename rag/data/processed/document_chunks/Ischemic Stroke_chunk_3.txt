brainstem or subcortical hemisphere lesion with a diameter of \<1.5 cm. The absence of potential cardiac sources for embolism is expected, and evaluation of the major extracranial arteries should not reveal stenosis >50% in an artery on the same side.[7] **Stroke of undetermined etiology:** In numerous cases, determining the cause of a stroke proves challenging. Some patients undergo extensive evaluation yet yield no likely etiology. Others undergo only a cursory evaluation, resulting in an undetermined cause. This category also encompasses patients with 2 or more potential causes of stroke, making it difficult for physicians to reach a definitive diagnosis. For instance, a patient presenting with a medium-risk cardiac source of embolism alongside another potential cause of stroke would be classified as having a stroke of undetermined etiology. Similarly, a patient with atrial fibrillation and ipsilateral carotid stenosis of 50%, or one with a traditional lacunar syndrome and ipsilateral carotid stenosis of 50%, would fall into this category.[8] **Stroke of other determined etiology:** This group consists of patients with uncommon stroke causes, such as nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, hypercoagulable states, or hematologic disorders. Patients in this category should exhibit clinical symptoms and CT or MRI findings indicative of acute ischemic stroke, regardless of the size or location of the lesion. Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or arteriography, should reveal 1 of these unusual stroke causes. Other studies should be conducted to rule out cardiac sources of embolism and large artery atherosclerosis.[9] ## Epidemiology In 2021, stroke accounted for 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease, with someone in the US experiencing a stroke every 40 seconds, resulting in a stroke-related death every 3 minutes and 14 seconds.[10] Annually, over 795,000 Americans suffer from a stroke, of which approximately 610,000 are initial occurrences.[10] Nearly a quarter of these strokes, roughly 185,000 cases, occur in individuals with a history of previous strokes. Ischemic strokes, blocking blood flow to the brain, constitute about 87% of all strokes. According to the Framingham Heart Study, stroke incidence has declined. However, the cohort was predominantly a White population.[11][12][13] The financial burden of stroke in the US amounted to nearly $56.5 billion between 2018 and 2019, covering healthcare expenses, medication, and lost productivity due to missed workdays. Stroke stands as a primary contributor to severe long-term disability, particularly affecting mobility in over half of stroke survivors aged 65 and older.[14] Disparities in stroke incidence and outcomes exist across racial
