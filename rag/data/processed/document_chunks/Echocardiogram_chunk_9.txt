its low sensitivity but high specificity, it may be an adequate rule-in test during critical situations at the bedside. Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE): When a patient has a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis, it is important to have a much clearer image of the valvular structure to identify valvular prolapse, rupture, or infective vegetation on the valves[11] The ability to recognize vegetation will drive the time course of antibiotic treatment, TTE is not always sensitive enough to identity vegetation. Patients who undergo cardioversion for atrial fibrillation or flutter, who have not been anticoagulated previously, will need to undergo TEE to assess for thrombus first. TEE is able to assess the left atrial appendage (LAA) for the presence of thrombus, which is the most commonplace for the formation of clots. If a patient were to undergo cardioversion with a thrombus present, it could dislodge and cause a cerebrovascular accident. If a thrombus is not identified on echocardiography, the cardioversion may proceed.[11] Finally, when patients are undergoing intracardiac transcatheter valve procedures, septal closure device placement, or catheter ablation, TTE is generally used as it provides clearer imaging to assist in the procedures in real-time. Stress Echocardiography: When appropriate, stress echocardiography is a great initial modality to assess for cardiac ischemia. First, the patient's heart function is assessed at rest to determine a baseline, next the heart is stressed using either running on a treadmill or pharmacological stressors, including dobutamine, adenosine, or dipyridamole.[22] Next, using ECG and echocardiogram, cardiac rhythm and images are obtained after the patient has achieved appropriate exercise capacity or 85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate.[22] If ECG changes and new or worsening wall motion abnormalities are seen on echocardiography, the patient will likely need to undergo cardiac catheterization and potentially percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with coronary stent placement if there is stenosis identified. If patients have significant chest pain or are unable to reach appropriate exercise capacity prior to completion, stress testing may be halted, and the patient would be referred for cardiac catheterization with possible PCI. Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE): The use of ICE is less frequent given its invasive technique, cost, steep learning curve, and due to the advancements in TTE and TEE.[12] The advantages of ICE include higher resolution imaging and avoids the need for sedation or endotracheal intubation.[26] As atrial septal defect closures are becoming more common to perform via transvenous route, and because TTE
