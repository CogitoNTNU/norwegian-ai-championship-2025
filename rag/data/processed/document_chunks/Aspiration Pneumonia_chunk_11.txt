accompanying lung abscesses or empyema may be considered for anaerobic coverage, it is essential to note that there is very low-quality evidence supporting this recommendation.[8] Of particular concern is the use of clindamycin to cover for anaerobes, as it increases the risk for _Clostridium difficile_ colitis. Clinical data shows no significant difference between ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, and carbapenems for treating suspected aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, moxifloxacin has demonstrated similar efficacy in treating aspiration pneumonia compared to ampicillin/sulbactam, with a clinical response rate of 66.7%.[6] Clindamycin is recommended only as additional therapy to provide better anaerobic coverage in patients with a high risk of predominantly anaerobic infection, such as those with severe periodontal disease coupled with necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscesses.[6] However, its use should be carefully considered due to the associated risk of _C_ _difficile_ colitis. Therapy with glucocorticoids has been extensively studied in patients with aspiration syndromes, but their use has not shown consistent clinical benefit in patients with aspiration-associated pleuropulmonary disease. According to current recommendations, glucocorticoid therapy does not manage aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.[6][8] The British Thoracic Society offers similar recommendations for managing aspiration pneumonia, emphasizing the polymicrobial nature of aspiration pneumonia and the necessity for broader-spectrum antibiotics for effective treatment. However, citing ecological concerns associated with the use of cephalosporins, the British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest initiating therapy with amoxicillin for most patients with aspiration pneumonia. In cases of penicillin allergy, alternatives such as respiratory fluoroquinolone, a macrolide, or a tetracycline may be considered.[1] Adequate oxygenation is another essential component of treatment in patients with treatment in patients with aspiration pneumonia. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend maintaining a 94% to 98% target oxygen saturation for most patients. In acutely ill patients with a higher disease severity, oxygen saturation of 94% to 96% may be optimal. However, exceptions should be made for patients at risk for hypercapnia due to underlying comorbidities, with a target oxygenation range between 88% and 92% as clinically appropriate.[1] ## Differential Diagnosis In the differential diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, several conditions warrant consideration, and it is crucial to differentiate aspiration pneumonia from these entities:[4] - Aspiration pneumonitis - CAP - Acute respiratory distress syndrome - Viral Pneumonia - Negative-pressure pulmonary edema: Presents with bilateral symmetric lung infiltrates and occurs due to breathing against a closed airway. It can happen during events such as general anesthesia, choking, or near drowning.[6] ## Prognosis Patients with CAP
