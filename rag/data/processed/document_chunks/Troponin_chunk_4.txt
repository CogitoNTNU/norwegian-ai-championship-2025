define an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.[41] NSTEMIs usually represent less myocardial tissue damage than STEMIs, and an emergent coronary catheterization is not needed initially.[42] NSTEMIs are generally treated with medical management, including dual antiplatelet therapy and full anticoagulation, such as heparin.[43] NSTEMIs present a difficult challenge to the emergency provider. It is possible that a patient with chest pain can initially have a negative troponin with no ECG changes but can still have an NSTEMI because troponin levels do not start to rise until at least 2 to 3 hours after the initial insult.[44] This emphasizes the importance of getting serial troponins spaced 3 to 6 hours apart in patients suspected of having an ischemic event but with a troponin that is initially normal.[45] ## Testing Procedures Several assays for troponin are commercially available. A variety of quantitative and semiquantitative point-of-care methods have also been developed. Current assays for cTnT and cTnI are two- or three-site immunoassays.[23] All the assays are of the capture type, where an immobilized antibody specifically binds the troponin present in the serum or plasma. The captured troponin is then reacted with a second antibody and, in some assays, a third antibody coupled to an indicator molecule.[36] The assays vary from each other by the types of antibody used, by the epitopes to which they bind, and by the type of indicator molecule that is used.[46] cTnI assays are also used at the point of care.[47] In a two-site ELISA cTnI assay, heparinized whole blood or plasma is added to the single-use cartridge, which has an electrochemical sensor.[48] This initiates the assay and allows the monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody and ALP-conjugated monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody to dissolve into the sample. cTnI in the sample becomes labeled with an ALP-conjugated antibody and is captured onto the sensor surface during the incubation step.[49] Wash fluid containing enzyme substrate is then applied to remove unbound substances, and at the same time, ALP bound to the antigen-antibody complex reacts, releasing an electrochemically detectable product. The generated amperometric signal is directly proportional to the cTnI in the sample.[50] In another cartridge-based reader system, cTnI in EDTA whole blood or plasma is added to the system sample port via a transfer pipette. Red blood cells are separated from the plasma via a filter in the device, and a fixed plasma volume reacts with fluorescent-conjugated anti-cTnI antibodies.[51] The reaction mixture flows down the device until
