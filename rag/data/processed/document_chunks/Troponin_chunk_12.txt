accuracy and reliability of the laboratory with regard to other laboratories performing the same or comparable assays. Required participation and scored results are monitored by CMS and voluntary accreditation organizations.[104] The PT plan should be included as an aspect of the quality assessment (QA) plan and the overall quality program of the laboratory.[105] Quality assurance procedures should be implemented within the laboratory for the reliable and reproducible performance of troponin assays, particularly at low concentrations, to avoid reporting falsely positive results. In addition to regularly monitoring manufacturersâ€™ quality controls, daily measurement of a negative control sample and a low-level control with a troponin concentration close to the 20% CV level (in-house or manufactured if available) can detect assay drift or deterioration of assay performance.[106] Compared with a short-term evaluation, long-term monitoring of troponin imprecision will consider new troponin reagent lots, changes in reagent formulation, and any suboptimal analyzer performance.[107] Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the usual precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.[108] Wear gloves, a lab coat, and safety glasses when handling human blood specimens. Place all plastic tips, sample cups, and gloves that come into contact with blood in a biohazard waste container.[109] Discard all disposable glassware into sharps waste containers. Protect all work surfaces with disposable absorbent bench top paper, discarded into biohazard waste containers weekly or whenever blood contamination occurs. Wipe all work surfaces weekly.[110] The new standard for the highly sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assay is defined as the ability to detect cTn concentrations precisely with a coefficient of variation, \<10 % at or the below the 99th percentile URL and measurable in >50% of normal healthy individuals.[111] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes All healthcare workers, including advanced practice providers, should be familiar with biological markers for myocardial infarction. However, one should never negate the history and physical examination.[112] The final confirmation of a myocardial infarction utilizes many other parameters like an ECG, ECHO, and a chest x-ray. One should never rely on a single serum test because of false positives and negatives.[113] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=30637&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=30637) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/30637/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=30637) ## References 1.
