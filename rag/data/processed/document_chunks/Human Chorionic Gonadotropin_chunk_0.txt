Measuring hCG levels can help distinguish between normal and abnormal pregnancies and is also useful for monitoring after a pregnancy loss. In addition, hCG testing can aid in the diagnosis of certain cancers, such as choriocarcinoma and some extra-uterine malignancies. Exogenous administration of hCG as a bolus is standard practice for in vitro fertilization transfer care. ## Etiology and Epidemiology hCG plays a crucial role in maintaining early pregnancy by supporting the corpus luteum, which in turn sustains progesterone production essential for maintaining the endometrium. The hormone acts through the luteinizing hormone/hCG receptor, activating intracellular signaling pathways that promote steroidogenesis and inhibit luteolysis. Smaller amounts of hCG are also produced in the pituitary gland, the liver, and the colon.[1] hCG is a glycoprotein composed of two subunits—the alpha and beta subunits.[1] During pregnancy, multiple forms of the hormone are present in the serum and urine, including both the intact hormone and its free subunits. hCG is primarily catabolized by the liver, although about 20% is excreted in the urine. The beta subunit is degraded into a core fragment in the kidney, which is measured by urine hCG tests. ## Pathophysiology In pathological conditions such as gestational trophoblastic disease—including hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and germ cell tumors—hCG is produced in excess due to abnormal trophoblastic proliferation, resulting in markedly elevated serum levels. These abnormal elevations can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response. ## Specimen Requirements and Procedure Accurate hCG testing begins with proper specimen collection, as errors at this stage can lead to false or misleading results. Adhering to recommended guidelines ensures consistency and improves the reliability of clinical interpretation. **Urine Testing** - Urine should not be collected after the patient drinks a large amount of fluid, as a dilute specimen may result in a falsely negative test.[2] - Blood in the urine may cause a false-positive result. **Serum Testing** - Peripheral blood can be obtained for a serum hCG test. **Capillary Testing** - There may be a new role for
