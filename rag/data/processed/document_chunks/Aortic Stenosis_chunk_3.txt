severity of valve calcification and can also allow direct imaging of the orifice area.[20] A more sensitive measure of LV function predicting adverse events, including mortality, is the longitudinal systolic strain imaging.[21][22][23][24] Exercise testing helps in unmasking symptoms in asymptomatic patients, but it should be avoided in symptomatic patients.[25] Cardiac computed tomography (CT) use is expanding in patients with calcific aortic valve disease. It is used when all the non-invasive tests are inconclusive. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assess LV mass, function, and volume when it cannot be obtained readily in echocardiography. ## Treatment / Management Studies have shown that medical therapy does not significantly affect disease progression in aortic stenosis.[16][26][17]. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is superior to medical therapy in severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, as proven in observational studies and randomized control trials. As hypertension accompanies the disease most of the time, it is understandable that there may be some reluctance in treating hypertension in this subset of patients as aortic stenosis is known to be a condition with fixed afterload. Vasodilation would not be offset by an increase in stroke volume. However, studies demonstrate that, even in patients with severe aortic stenosis, vasodilation is accompanied by a stroke volume increase. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are preferentially considered. AVR is indicated in patients with heart failure and volume overload, but diuretics can help decrease congestion and provide symptomatic relief before surgery. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty has a modest improvement in the hemodynamic status of the patients. Although it provides a short-term improvement in survival and quality of life, the benefits are not sustained.[27] AVR is recommended in adults with symptomatic aortic stenosis, even if the symptoms are mild. It is also recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis with (1) LV ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50%, (2) who are undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or any other form of heart surgery, (3) Abnormal exercise treadmill test, (4) peak velocity greater than 5 m/sec and mean pressure gradient greater than 60, and (5) annual progression of peak velocity of greater than 0.3 m/s/year.[28][17][29] AVR can be with a surgical or transcatheter approach.[30] Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea and angina are relieved in most of the patients, and a majority will experience an increase in exercise tolerance. LVEF often improves after the surgery, but longitudinal strain might still be impaired.[31] The operative mortality in surgical
