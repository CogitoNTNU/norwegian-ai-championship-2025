use receive stress-dose steroids, and patients with evidence of hypovolemia and hemorrhage receive blood products. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic enteric organisms are necessary when infection, peritoneal contamination, or sepsis is suspected. Healthcare professionals should remember that adequate pain management is essential and does not alter the assessment.[35] Potential interventions include acetaminophen, parenteral ketorolac, and opioids. Clinicians must exercise caution with ketorolac, as it can exacerbate gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and acute kidney injury. The diagnosis dictates further intervention and specialty consultation. Typical specialty involvement includes general or vascular surgery, gynecology, interventional radiology, urology, and gastroenterology. Patients with suspected perforation and pneumoperitoneum on initial radiographs warrant immediate surgical referral. In addition, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, testicular torsion, ovarian torsion, an obstructing infected kidney stone, and a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm are some examples of conditions that warrant immediate specialty and surgical referral. ## Differential Diagnosis Although the majority of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have a benign underlying cause, the differential diagnosis is extensive, and clinicians must rely on an organized approach to determine which patients require immediate surgical intervention or medical therapy. The following list includes potential differential diagnoses for patients presenting with acute abdominal pain: - Abdominal aortic aneurysm; - Abdominal compartment syndrome; - Abdominal migraine; - Acute hepatic porphyrias; - Acute appendicitis; - Acute cholangitis; - Acute cholecystitis; - Acute diverticulitis; - Acute hepatitis; - Acute intestinal ischemia; - Acute pancreatitis; - Acute peptic ulcer; - Acute peritonitis; - Acute pyelonephritis; - Acute ureteral colic; - Adrenal crisis; - Angioedema; - Biliary colic; - Bowel obstruction; - Bowel volvulus; - Budd-Chiari syndrome; - Carcinoid; - Celiac artery compression syndrome; - Celiac disease; - Colonic pseudo-obstruction; - Ectopic pregnancy with a tubal rupture; - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis; - Epiploic appendagitis; - Familial Mediterranean fever; - Gastroparesis; - Helminthic infections; - Herpes zoster; - Hemoperitoneum; - Hypercalcemia; - Hypothyroidism; - IgA vasculitis; - Incarcerated hernia; - Intussusception; - Ketoacidosis; - Kidney stone; - Lactose intolerance; - Lead poisoning; - Liver abscess; - Malignancy; - Meckel's diverticulum; - Mesenteric ischemia; - Narcotic bowel syndrome; - Necrotizing enterocolitis; - Ovarian torsion; - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; - Pelvic inflammatory disease; - Perihepatitis; - Portal vein thrombosis; - Pseudoappendicitis; - Pulmonary etiologies such as pneumonia; - Rectus sheath hematoma; - Renal infarction; - Rib pain; - Ruptured spleen; - Sclerosing mesenteritis; - Sickle cell anemia; - Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; - Splenic abscess;
