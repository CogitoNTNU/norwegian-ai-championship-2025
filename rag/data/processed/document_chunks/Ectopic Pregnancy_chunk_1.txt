or progesterone-only contraceptives.[1][4] Although rare, ectopic pregnancies can also occur outside the fallopian tube, such as in the cervix, ovary, abdomen, uterine cornua, or cesarean scars.[5] These extratubal ectopic pregnancies are less likely to be associated with the typical risk factors or tubal pathology, making their diagnosis and management particularly challenging. Regardless of the location, early detection is critical for conservative treatment and improving outcomes.[1][4] Ectopic pregnancy often causes lower abdominal pain, typically on one side, along with vaginal bleeding. Symptoms like dizziness, fainting, shoulder pain, or severe pelvic pain may indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. However, these signs can mimic other conditions, eg, early normal intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, ovarian cyst rupture, or appendicitis.[1] Therefore, differentiating ectopic pregnancy from conditions with similar clinical features can be difficult, making prompt medical evaluation crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.[1][4] Management primarily aims to preserve fertility, improve diagnostic accuracy, and provide psychological support. Treatment varies, depending on clinical stability, ectopic location, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels, and ultrasound findings ranging from expectant management to surgical interventions. In select cases, nonsurgical treatment with methotrexate may be effective, especially when pregnancies are diagnosed early and meet specific criteria. However, medical treatment is less likely to succeed in cases involving larger masses, high β-hCG levels, or visible embryos. Advanced or ruptured cases typically require urgent surgical intervention.[1][4][6] ## Etiology Ectopic pregnancy, in essence, is the implantation of an embryo outside of the uterine cavity. Ectopic pregnancies most commonly occur in the fallopian tube (see **Image**. Tubal Ectopic Pregnancy); however, they may also develop within cesarean scars, the endocervical canal (see **Image**. Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy), the ovary, and the peritoneal cavity. Within the fallopian tube, ectopics most frequently are located at the ampulla region (70%), but may occur anywhere along the length of the tube, eg, the cornua (interstitial ectopic), fimbriae, or proximal segment (isthmic ectopic).[2] An ectopic pregnancy may also occur concomitantly with a normally developing pregnancy in the endometrial cavity, known as a heterotopic pregnancy.[4] For a tubal ectopic pregnancy, various underlying pathologies can lead to damage to the fallopian tubes, inducing tubal dysfunction, which can result in retention of an oocyte or embryo within the tube. Additionally, women with tubal ligation or other postsurgical alterations to their fallopian tubes are at risk for ectopic pregnancies due to alteration of the native function of the fallopian tube. Conversely, atypical ectopic pregnancies secondary to extratubal implantations
