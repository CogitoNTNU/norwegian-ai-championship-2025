with nebulized MgSO4 compared to placebo reveal a favorable effect on the FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate.[38] These results somewhat contradict the Cochrane Database review conducted in 2014, which evaluated the same studies.[37] An additional study reveals a small benefit of adding inhaled magnesium to inhaled albuterol plus ipratropium in reducing hospital admissions but no significant improvement in peak expiratory flow when added to inhaled albuterol plus ipratropium or inhaled albuterol alone.[39] **Intubation or Noninvasive Ventilation** Indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation include the following: - Slowing of the respiratory rate - Depressed mental status - Inability to maintain respiratory effort - Inability to cooperate with the administration of inhaled medications - Worsening hypercapnia and associated respiratory acidosis - Inability to maintain oxygen saturation above 92% despite face mask supplemental oxygen A 1- to 2-hour trial of bilevel noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is appropriate for patients with an acute asthma exacerbation, but clinicians should maintain a low threshold for intubation.[40][41] **Additional Therapies** Occasionally, nonstandard therapies, such as ketamine, halothane, helium-oxygen mixtures, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and parenteral terbutaline, can be helpful for certain patients. However, these therapies are not routinely utilized due to limited evidence of efficacy. The indication for parenteral epinephrine is asthma associated with anaphylaxis and angioedema. All patients who are smokers should be educated on the benefits of smoking cessation and provided with appropriate support and resources. Empiric antibiotics are not recommended since most infections triggering asthma exacerbations are viral. According to both GINA and NAEPP guidelines, intravenous methylxanthines such as theophylline are deemed ineffective and are no longer part of the standard of care.[42] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses for asthma include the following conditions: - Bronchiectasis - Bronchiolitis - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Chronic sinusitis - Cystic fibrosis - Î±1-antitrypsin deficiency - Aspergillosis - Exercise-induced anaphylaxis - Foreign body aspiration - Heart failure - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Tracheomalacia - Pulmonary embolism - Pulmonary eosinophilia - Sarcoidosis - Upper respiratory tract infection - Vocal cord dysfunction - Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis - Bronchogenic carcinoma - Post-viral tussive syndrome - Eosinophilic bronchitis - Cough induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors - Bordetella pertussis infection - Interstitial lung disease - Obesity - Recurrent oropharyngeal aspiration ## Prognosis The development and prognosis of asthma involve a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Social determinants of health, such as poor housing quality and indoor
