- Valvular heart disease - Metabolic causes (ie, obesity) - Myocarditis (ie, secondary to human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, medications, or viruses) - Infiltrative disorders (ie, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) - Peripartum cardiomyopathy - Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) - Valvular heart disease - Medications (ie, amphetamines, anabolic steroids) - Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy - Toxins (ie, cocaine, alcohol) - Nutritional deficiency (ie, L-carnitine deficiency, thiamine) [1] **Risk Factors for Acute Heart Failure and Flash Pulmonary Edema** Acute heart\*\*\*\* failure is the worsening of heart failure symptoms to the point that the patient requires intensification of therapy and intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure can be dramatic and rapid in onset, such as flash pulmonary edema, or more gradual with the worsening of symptoms over time until a critical point of decompensation is reached. For those with a history of preexisting heart failure, there is often a clear trigger for decompensation.[3][4] **Potential Triggers of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Flash Pulmonary Edema** - Arrhythmia - CAD - Infection - Worsening hypertension (ie, hypertensive crisis) - Medication non-adherence - Acute renal artery stenosis - Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction - Obstructive sleep apnea - Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [3][4] ## Epidemiology Heart failure is a major public health problem. This condition is now the most common cause of hospitalization in the United States among patients aged 65 and older, and approximately 91,500 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year. The increasing prevalence of heart failure is most likely secondary to the aging of the population, increased risk factors, better outcomes for acute coronary syndrome survivors, and a reduction in mortality secondary to improved management of chronic conditions. Further, incidence rates for heart failure increase with age for both sexes.[1][2][3][5] The lifetime risk of developing heart failure for those 40 and older residing in the United States is 20%. The risk and incidence of heart failure continue to increase from 20 per 1000 people aged 60 to 65 to over 80 per 1000 people aged 80 and older. There are also differences in risk for heart failure based on the population, with Black individuals having the highest risk and greater 5-year mortality for heart failure than the White population in the United States. The European Society of Cardiology states that the prevalence of heart failure is 1% to 2% and rises to greater than 10% in the population of those aged 70 and older.[1][3] **Heart Failure
