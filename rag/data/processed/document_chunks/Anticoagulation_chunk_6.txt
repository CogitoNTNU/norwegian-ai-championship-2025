in the PT or aPTT indicates the presence of either a deficiency or inhibitor of the clotting factor, except for the antiphospholipid antibody, which can result in delayed aPTT. The normal range for PT levels is approximately 11 to 13 seconds, although levels may vary depending on the laboratory. - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): Used to assess the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. The typical values range from 25 to 35 seconds, though this may vary between laboratories. - Thrombin Time: This measures the final step in the clotting cascade. Abnormal thrombin time can be caused by thrombin inhibitor anticoagulants like heparin, dabigatran, argatroban, and any abnormalities in fibrinogen. - Specific Clotting Factor Assays: This test is specific for individual factor deficiencies. It is done with the mixing study. - Clot Solubility: This test is used to assess for deficiency of factor 13. Factor 13 crosslinks the fibrin clot after its formation. - Fibrin D-dimer: Released from the cleavage of fibrin cross-linked by plasmin. ## Complications **Bleeding Risk on Anticoagulation** Several factors can increase the risk of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. The risks can be anticoagulant-related or patient-related. Providers need to consider other factors or errors that can increase the risk of bleeding in patients.[22][23] **Anticoagulant-Related Risks** 1. Studies have shown that the risk of significant bleed is higher with warfarin than with direct oral anticoagulants.[24] 1. Dose of anticoagulant 1. Concomitant use of other medications (e.g., antiplatelet agents) that independently increase the risk of bleeding **Patient-Related Risks** 1. Age 1. Race (risk increased in Black/Brown population) 1. Underlying medical conditions 1. Recent surgery 1. Coagulopathy **Anticoagulation Reversal** The initial step for any condition requiring urgent reversal of anticoagulation is always to discontinue the anticoagulant. Other standard measures that can be applied to most anticoagulants in certain significant and life-threatening bleeding situations include: a) Use of activated charcoal with 2 hours of the last dose of anticoagulant b) Hemodialysis c) Red blood cell transfusion for anemia d) Platelet transfusion if thrombocytopenic e) Some cases may warrant surgical or endoscopic intervention Different anticoagulants have specific reversal agents that act to counteract their effects. 1. Unfractionated Heparin: Protamine sulfate counteracts the anti-10a activity of unfractionated heparin. Protamine sulfate has a short half-life and is usually administered intravenously. The ideal dose to achieve full resolution of anti-10a action can be calculated by 1 mg/100units of heparin remaining in the
