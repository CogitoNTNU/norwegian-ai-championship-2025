the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend intubation with a GCS of 8 or less, while the CENTER-TBI advocates in-hospital intubation with a GCS of 10 or lower.[21] Maintaining euthermia may help prevent coagulopathy and infection associated with hypothermia, as well as increased metabolic demand and energy failure associated with hyperthermia. - Supplemental oxygen to all patients in the prehospital environment - Maintain end-tidal CO2 reading between 35 to 45 mm Hg - Pupil and GCS assessment every 30 mins - Prophylactic administration of hyperosmolar therapy in the absence of signs of herniation and prehospital tranexamic acid is discouraged.[47] The central dogma in managing raised ICP is preventing secondary insults. Ventricular catheters represent a "global" ICP and are the gold standard.[26] Parenchymal monitors, though easier to insert in cases of midline shift or malignant brain swelling, cannot be recalibrated in vivo, only measure a localized pressure, and have a high propensity for drift issues in long-term usage. The current noninvasive techniques such as pulsatility index from transcranial doppler, tympanic membrane displacement (otoacoustic emissions), near-infrared spectroscopy, and optic nerve sheath diameter assessments are not accurate enough to replace traditional invasive techniques and have significant inter-rater variability.[26] Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines advocate ICP monitoring for cohorts with: - Severe TBI (GCS of 3 to 8) with abnormal CT images or - At least two criteria: age over 40 years, SBP \<90 mm Hg, or abnormal posturing.[27] Other ICP Monitoring Recommendations include: - Patients with an initial normal CT scan or with minor changes in CT images but later show features of neurologic worsening or progression on the repeat scan - Evidence of brain swelling (eg, compressed or absent basal cisterns) - Extensive bifrontal contusions independent of the neurological condition - When sedation interruption to check neurological function is not justified (eg, respiratory failure from lung contusions and flail chest) - When the neurological examination is not reliable (eg, maxillofacial trauma or spinal cord injury) [26] World Society of Emergency Surgery strongly recommends following guidelines for the 'Hub and Spike' model of managing severe head injury: - Telemedicine to facilitate the early transfer of radio images - Hemodynamic stabilization before referral - Clear therapeutic communications and collaborations between personnel at the multispeciality level - Transfer via trained and certified health team with serial neurological monitoring (check only pupils without interrupting sedation among cohorts with features of raised intracranial pressure) - Pupillpmetry study or ocular ultrasound
