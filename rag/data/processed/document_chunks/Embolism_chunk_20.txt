critical observations and ensure the timely implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Pharmacists, as experts in anticoagulation therapy, provide essential input on drug selection, contraindications, and potential interactions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatment. Open communication and mutual respect among all healthcare professionals allow for comprehensive and well-informed decision-making, empowering each team member to contribute actively to patient care. By fostering a collaborative environment, PERTs and interprofessional teams optimize care coordination and team performance. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities, effective communication, and a unified strategy, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved safety in managing acute PE. Integrating diverse expertise within a cohesive team ensures patients receive timely, evidence-based, patient-centered care. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=42576&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=42576) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/acute-pulmonary-embolism-pulmonary-embolism/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=42576) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/42576/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=42576) [![Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism](/books/NBK560551/bin/800px-Pulmonary_embolism_ECG.gif)](/books/NBK560551/figure/article-42576.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK560551/figure/article-42576.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism.
