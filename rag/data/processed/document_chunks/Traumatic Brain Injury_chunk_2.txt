blast-related head injuries are the most lethal form of head trauma.[16] ## Epidemiology It is reported that almost 70 million individuals are estimated to suffer from some form of TBI, which is seen more commonly in males than females and occurs more in children, adults up to 24 years, and those older than 75.[17][18][19][20] Mild TBI is the most common form of TBI and comprises over 90% of cases presenting acutely to the hospital.[21] Although only 10% of TBIs occur in the elderly, they account for up to 50% of head trauma-related deaths. In middle and low-income nations, most head trauma results from road traffic accidents.[21] These are reported to be the highest in Africa and Southeast Asia.[17] In high-income nations, most TBI cases occur related to falls secondary to age-related frailty and alcohol misuse.[21] This group encompasses a considerable portion of the global injury burden.[22] The Global Burden of Disease study reported a worldwide age-standardized head trauma incidence of 346 per 100,000 people in 2019. In 2016, it was estimated that TBI resulted in 8.1 million years lived with disability and a pooled age-standardized rate of about 160 years of life lost per 100,000 people.[21] ## Pathophysiology Traumatic brain injury following head trauma results from primary and secondary injury/insults. **Primary Injury** Primary injury includes injury upon the initial impact that causes displacement of the brain due to direct impact, rapid acceleration-deceleration, or penetration. These injuries may cause skull fractures, cerebral contusions, hematomas (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid), and diffuse axonal injury (DAI). **Secondary Injury** A secondary neurotoxic cascade occurs after the initial insult and is most commonly secondary to hypoxia, hypotension, and raised intracranial pressure. Neuropathogenesis implicated in secondary injury in head trauma include: - Wallerian degeneration - Mitochondrial dysfunction - Glutamate hyper-excitotoxicity [23] - Lactate storm - Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation - Apoptotic cell death - Neuroinflammation - Impaired autophagy - Impaired G-lymphatic pathways [24][25] The glutamate hyper-excitotoxicity pathway describes when injured nerve cells secrete intracellular glutamate into the extracellular spaces. This then overstimulates a subtype glutamate receptor, allowing sodium and calcium influx into the injured nerve cell. This influx of ions activates various enzymes, which then degrade cell membranes and structure, leading to free radicals, cell death, and edema.[23] According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) are the prime buffers against any extra volume increment inside the rigid skull.[26]
