to bind specific proteins. Detecting posttranslational modifications can be more challenging; methods such as colorimetric assays, radioactive isotope-labeled substrates, Western blotting with protein-specific antibodies, and peptide and protein arrays are also used.[17] Plasma and urine metanephrines are metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Metanephrines are relatively stable compared to catecholamines and can be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 days without significant degradation. For testing delays longer than 3 days, storing samples at -20 °C or lower is recommended.[6] ## Interfering Factors The amount of creatinine produced daily depends on muscle mass. As CKD progresses, muscle mass tends to decline, which affects creatinine production. Therefore, creatinine reference ranges vary between sexes, with lower values typically seen in children and individuals with reduced muscle mass. Dietary factors also influence creatinine levels; for instance, consumption of red meat can alter creatinine by up to 30%. In addition, some patients, particularly young males, may use creatine supplements to increase muscle mass, so it is important to inquire directly about this.[18] During pregnancy, GFR increases, resulting in lower creatinine levels. This factor should be considered when interpreting creatinine measurements in pregnant women. One limitation of using creatinine formulas to estimate GFR is that serum creatinine levels may not reflect renal impairment until it has advanced significantly. In some studies, renal function can decrease by up to 50% before a rise in serum creatinine is detected.[19] Medications commonly affecting urine metanephrine levels are listed in the **Specimen Requirements and Procedure** section. ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings The components of 24-hour urine tests vary by laboratory, but standard analyses typically include urine volume, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid concentrations, pH levels, and supersaturation values. Supersaturation levels for calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid are commonly reported. Additional analytes may include sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, ammonium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrogen (in the form of urea). Reports usually provide reference range values to help assess the risk of stone formation. Specialized testing is available for pediatric individuals and those with cystinuria, which includes measuring cystine excretion, supersaturation, and urine pH. Since urine chemistry is a continuous variable, strict cut-off points for abnormal values are somewhat arbitrary. As urinary constituents deviate from normal or optimal ranges, the risk of stone formation increases. Below is a summary of the key components of the 24-hour urinalysis and their clinical significance. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing
