by additional evidence. - Stage D (advanced): Patients who meet the criteria for Stage C myocarditis and exhibit hemodynamic instability or severe arrhythmias requiring interventions such as mechanical circulatory support or evaluation for heart transplantation. ## Prognosis Given the wide variability in clinical presentation, disease severity, and underlying etiology, the prognosis of acute myocarditis is equally heterogeneous. Adverse cardiovascular outcomes are more likely in patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure, sustained arrhythmias, a LVEF below 50%, or those requiring inotropes, vasopressors, or mechanical circulatory support. Nonetheless, patients who survive the acute phase often have favorable outcomes.[23] Long-term follow-up indicates that at least 50% of patients develop cardiomyopathy. The 1-year mortality rate for acute myocarditis is approximately 20%, increasing to 56% by 4 years. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Viral Myocarditis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25470)," for more information. Fulminant myocarditis is associated with significantly higher mortality rates and reduced transplant-free survival.[24] Persistent detection of viral genomes on serial EMBs is a poor prognostic indicator and may signal a diminished response to therapy.[25] The prognosis is also particularly unfavorable in cases of eosinophilic and giant cell myocarditis. Biomarkers can also provide prognostic insights—the presence of soluble Fas ligand at presentation suggests more favorable outcomes, whereas the presence of antimyosin autoantibodies is associated with a worse prognosis.[21][26] According to the 2024 ECDP, key risk factors for adverse outcomes in myocarditis include: - Clinical presentation: Heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or electrical instability, such as recurrent ventricular tachycardia or advanced atrioventricular block. - Echocardiography: Evidence of biventricular dysfunction. - Cardiac MRI: Presence of biventricular dysfunction and LGE. - Endomyocardial biopsy: Histopathological diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis.[5] ## Complications Acute complications of myocarditis include: - Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. - Cardiogenic shock. - Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation: This increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. - Bradyarrhythmias: High-grade atrioventricular block necessitating intervention. - Atrial arrhythmias: Atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. - Thromboembolic events: These events include stroke or systemic embolism due to left ventricular dysfunction. Subacute and chronic or long-term complications include: - Dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure. - Recurrent episodes of myocarditis. - Increased risk of sudden cardiac death. - Myocardial fibrosis and scarring. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Preventing acute myocarditis begins with addressing avoidable causes, particularly infectious triggers such as respiratory and enteroviral illnesses. Patients should be educated on essential hygiene practices—such as regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with individuals who
