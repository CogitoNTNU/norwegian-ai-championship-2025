survival outcomes. **Prognosis Based on Dissection Type** - **Stanford type A dissections** - Mortality without treatment - Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the high risk of fatal complications, such as cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Without intervention, the mortality rate increases by 1% to 2% per hour within the first 24 to 48 hours, reaching nearly 50% by the end of the first week. - Surgical mortality - With prompt surgical repair, the in-hospital mortality rate for type A dissections is around 15% to 30%, depending on factors such as patient age, presence of comorbidities, and intraoperative complications. Despite successful surgical intervention, long-term mortality remains high due to risks of recurrence, progressive aortic disease, and associated complications. - Long-term outcomes - The 5-year survival rate after surgical repair is approximately 70% to 80%, while the 10-year survival rate decreases to around 50% to 60%. Late mortality is often due to complications such as aortic aneurysms, redissection, and cardiovascular events. - **Stanford type B dissections** - Prognosis with medical management - Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed conservatively with blood pressure control. The in-hospital mortality rate for medically managed type B dissections is around 10% to 15%. Patients who remain stable during the acute phase have a relatively favorable short-term prognosis. - Prognosis with complications - Complicated type B dissections, such as those associated with malperfusion syndromes, rupture, or rapid expansion, carry a higher risk of adverse outcomes. In these cases, in-hospital mortality can exceed 30% to 40% if not promptly treated with endovascular or surgical intervention. - Long-term outcomes - The 5-year survival rate for type B dissections is approximately 75% to 85%, but patients are at increased risk of aortic aneurysm formation, redissection, and rupture over time. Regular imaging surveillance and blood pressure control are critical to improving long-term prognosis. **Prognostic Factors** Several clinical and anatomical factors influence the prognosis of patients with aortic dissection. Time to diagnosis and treatment is paramount, particularly for type A dissections, as delays in intervention significantly increase the risk of fatal outcomes due to rapid disease progression and life-threatening complications. The extent and location of the dissection also play a crucial role in prognosis, with dissections involving the aortic arch or extending into the abdominal aorta carrying a higher risk of complications, including organ malperfusion, neurologic deficits, and increased surgical complexity.
