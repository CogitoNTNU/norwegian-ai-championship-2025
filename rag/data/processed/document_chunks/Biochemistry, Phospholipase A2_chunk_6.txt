as a target for pharmaceutical drugs being the most potent PLA enzyme studied as playing a pivotal role in inflammatory disease pathogenesis. A wide variety of cytosolic PLA inhibitors have been developed and studied regarding their efficacy in treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory-mediated hyperalgesia. Clinical trials are necessary to validate the safety and efficacy of these experimental drugs in human subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the pharmacological targeting of this enzyme to affect cell cycle progression for the treatment of various cancers and proliferative glomerulopathies. **Ca-Independent PLA** Research regarding the clinical role in Ca-independent PLA inhibitors is much more limited than some of the other more well-studied forms of the enzyme. As further research explains the clinical significance of the enzyme, the development of pharmaceutical targets within the enzyme will become more evident. Of note, a recent study showing the efficacy of 2 Ca-independent PLA inhibitors in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents have proved to be effective in inhibiting the development of some forms of ovarian cancer. **Lysosomal PLA** One important studied function of lysosomal PLA involves the activation of pulmonary T-cells in response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This role warrants further investigation of the pharmacological treatment of tuberculosis. More research is needed to evaluate the role of enzymatic manipulation of lysosomal PLA on various other disease processes. **Adipose-Specific PLA** Knock-out mice that lack adipose-specific PLA exhibit a high rate of lipolysis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation within adipocytes. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of normal enzymatic function may be useful in the treatment of obesity. **Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase** Due to its well-studied role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, researchers have studied platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase inhibitors regarding their efficacy in lowering the risk for cardiovascular events. One notable studied inhibitor in clinical trials includes darapladib, which yields promising results in the prevention and attenuation of events related to coronary artery disease.[1][2][7][5][6] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27140&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27140) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27140/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27140) ## References 1.
