Physical Because the presentation is often not straightforward, the diagnosis can be difficult and often time-consuming. Besides pain, the patient may present with bleeding per rectum, unstable vital signs, and the presence of peritonitis. The physical exam may reveal marks from a lap belt, ecchymosis, abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds, and tenderness to palpation. If peritonitis is present, abdominal rigidity, guarding, and rebound tenderness may be present. The mechanism of injury, motor vehicle speed, associated deaths at the scene, and uses of alcohol or other substances of abuse must be taken into account so as not to miss an injury. Cullen's sign is a periumbilical ecchymosis that develops when retroperitoneal bleeding dissects along the falciform ligament anteriorly. ## Evaluation The evaluation of any trauma patient begins with evaluating the airway, accessing the breathing, and managing the circulation. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury following blunt trauma depends primarily on the hemodynamic status of the patient. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, a CT scan is the ideal test for solid organ injury in the abdomen and pelvis. For unstable patients, one may perform an ultrasound (Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (EFAST)) or diagnostic peritoneal lavage, both of which are associated with a high rate of false negatives and false positives.[3][9][10] All indications for trauma ultrasound include blunt or penetrating trauma to the torso where there is a suspicion of intraperitoneal hemorrhage, pericardial tamponade, and hemothorax. The\*\*\*\* Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma\*\*(EFAST)\*\* exam includes the following views: 1\. **RUQ (right upper quadrant)** - One should evaluate for free fluid in Morison's pouch or the hepatorenal space, the lower pole of the kidney, and the space below the diaphragm on the right. In the supine patient, the hepatorenal space is the most dependent area and the least obstructed for fluid flow. Fluid in the abdomen can move freely to the right pericolic gutter into this space. 2\. **Perisplenic space LUQ (left upper quadrant)** - One should visualize the diaphragm and the entire spleen - Check above the diaphragm for signs of free fluid in the left hemithorax. On the left, fluid flows preferentially into the subphrenic area and not into the splenorenal area, which is important because the subphrenic area may be difficult to visualize due to bowel gas and splenic flexure gas. 3\. **Pelvis (bladder)** - Visualize the interface w/ the rectum, prostate, or uterus. - Additionally, a
