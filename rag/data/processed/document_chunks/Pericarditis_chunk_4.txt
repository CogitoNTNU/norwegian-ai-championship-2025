pericarditis who are hemodynamically stable and do not have stigmas of chronic constriction may be treated with anti-inflammatory agents for up to 3 months with close monitoring. If these patients develop signs of chronic constriction and hemodynamic instability they should undergo prompt surgical treatment. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for constrictive pericarditis includes: - Cardiac sarcoma - Cardiac tamponade - Dilated cardiac myopathy - HIV infections and AIDS - Hemochromatosis - Nephrotic syndrome - Ovarian cancer - Pericardial effusion - Sarcoidosis - Tricuspid regurgitation ## Complications The complications that can manifest with constrictive pericarditis are as follows: - Pulmonary hypertension - Hepatomegaly - Renal failure - Metabolic acidosis - Hypoxia - Shock - Death ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes In the US, constrictive pericarditis is not common, and long-term data are scarce. Anecdotal reports suggest that when the diagnosis is made early, the outcomes are good. But if the disorder is misdiagnosed or untreated, mortality rates in excess of 90% are common. For patients who undergo pericardiectomy, the 10-year survival is about 50%. Medical therapy alone leads to a poor life expectancy. The long-term survival after constrictive pericarditis depends on the cause. The worst outcomes are in patients with radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis and the best outcomes are seen in patients following open heart surgery. Negative prognostic factors include advanced age, renal malfunction, low ejection fraction and elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Most patients who are untreated quickly develop multiorgan dysfunction, hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Patients should be promptly referred to a tertiary care center which specializes in the management of constrictive pericarditis when treatment is not available at the presenting hospital.[14][15][16] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19916&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19916) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/constrictive-pericarditis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19916) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19916/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19916) ## References 1.
