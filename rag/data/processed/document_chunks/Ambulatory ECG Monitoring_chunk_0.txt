Ambulatory ECG monitoring can be critical for diagnosing intermittent and infrequent arrhythmias or monitoring cardiac function in patients with noncardiac comorbidities such as COPD and end-stage renal disease. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is instrumental in determining the underlying causes of cardiac syncope, palpitations, and chest pain, facilitating accurate and timely diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. Various ambulatory monitors are clinically available, and the number increases with evolving technology. This activity highlights the indications for and clinical significance of various ambulatory ECG monitoring devices and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in caring for patients who may benefit from this testing modality. **Objectives:** - Select an appropriate modality of ambulatory ECG monitoring for a patient based on their clinical history. - Counsel patients on how to optimize the accuracy of ambulatory ECG monitoring results. - Apply best practices when interpreting the results of ambulatory ECG monitoring. - Develop and implement interprofessional healthcare team strategies to improve outcomes for patients requiring ambulatory ECG monitoring.

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a foundational diagnostic tool offering valuable insight into the function of the cardiac conduction system. However, traditional ECG recordings in clinical settings provide only a snapshot of cardiac activity, limiting their ability to capture intermittent or subtle abnormalities.[3] Ambulatory ECG monitoring enables continuous and prolonged surveillance of a patient's cardiac rhythm in their natural environment.[4] Ambulatory ECG monitoring employs portable devices to record and analyze cardiac electrical activity over extended periods. Continuous, prolonged monitoring is more likely to detect transient or infrequent cardiac events that may go unnoticed during short-term recordings. The prototype of ambulatory ECG monitoring is the Holter monitor, invented in 1961.[5] Ambulatory ECG monitoring has continually
