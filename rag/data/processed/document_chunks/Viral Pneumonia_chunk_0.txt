This activity describes the evaluation and management of viral pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients. **Objectives:** - Describe the most common pathogens associated with viral pneumonia. - Outline the typical presentation of a patient with viral pneumonia. - Identify the type of viral pneumonia that can be prevented by vaccination. - Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care by educating patients about methods for preventing viral pneumonia.

The traditional role of viral pneumonia was as a disease found predominantly in the very young, the elderly, and those exposed to influenza. In the past, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was predicated on it being somewhat a diagnosis of exclusion. History, physical exam, chest radiography, and available lab work (until recently) lacked sensitivity and specificity. Once bacterial pneumonia has been excluded, then viral pneumonia diagnosis was entertained.[1][2][3] Traditionally, the treatment of viral pneumonia revolved around supportive care: - Supplemental oxygen when indicated - Airway augmentation as appropriate - Monitoring of and replacement of any fluid deficits - Symptomatic control of temperature and cough - Rest to reduce oxygen demand - Treatment of any comorbidities and/or concomitant bacterial pneumonia The concepts of diagnosis, prevalence, clinical role, and treatment of viral pneumonia are in flux for several reasons. 1\. There is a growing population at increased risk of viral pneumonia: - The increases in life span and early infant survivability have created an additional population at greater risk of viral pneumonia. - The increased number of those receiving immune-impairing therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy) for cancer. -
