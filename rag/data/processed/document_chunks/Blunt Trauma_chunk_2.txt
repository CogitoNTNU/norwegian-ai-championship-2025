otalgia, ear fluttering, pain, vertigo, and hyperacusis. Characteristic audiometric findings can be observed following AAT, and prompt recognition and referral to otolaryngology may help prevent permanent hearing impairment.[5][6] Despite its distinct history and audiometric profile, AAT has not garnered as much research attention in the literature as NIHL. Additionally, patient awareness and urgency in seeking treatment for AAT are often low. Many individuals underreport AAT or continue to expose themselves to further trauma due to their responsibilities and circumstances, particularly in military settings. A retrospective study revealed that relatively few patients report symptoms immediately after the trauma, with most incidents occurring in military environments.[7] AAT may damage both the middle and inner ear, leading to issues such as tympanic membrane perforation, disruption of the ossicular chain, and direct injuries to the cochlear or vestibular apparatus from blunt force or ballistic trauma. The resulting hearing loss can be conductive, mixed, or sensorineural, though it is most commonly sensorineural. Accompanying symptoms may include vertigo, tinnitus, and pain. The extent of hearing impairment depends on factors such as noise intensity, duration of exposure, the adequacy of hearing protection used, and the individualâ€™s genetic susceptibility. Sensorineural hearing loss may be accompanied by a diminished sensitivity to specific frequencies, subtle difficulties in hearing in noisy environments, and bothersome sensations of ear ringing or fluttering. A classic presentation following AAT might involve a patient with an intact tympanic membrane but decreased hearing thresholds above 3 kHz after a blast, as intense weapon noise typically falls within the 2 to 5 kHz range.[8] The sensory cells of the cochlea are particularly susceptible following AAT, with the initial structural change often being damage to the stereocilia bundle.[9] Sensorineural hearing loss can be either temporary or permanent. Individuals with this condition may no longer hear low-level sounds, while high-level sounds might still be perceived as equally loud by those with normal hearing. This phenomenon can be explained by the following 2 theories. - Loudness recruitment: An abnormally rapid increase in loudness.[10] - Softness imperception: Soft sounds perceived by individuals with sensorineural hearing loss are louder than the faintest sounds heard by those with normal hearing.[11] Many insights regarding AAT can be drawn from similar clinical scenarios, such as sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss and ototoxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. Both conditions share common mechanisms involving the development of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, free radicals, and oxidative stress.[12] The most effective
