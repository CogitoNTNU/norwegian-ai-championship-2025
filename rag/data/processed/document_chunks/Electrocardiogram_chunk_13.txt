hyperkalemia, blunt trauma, pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, Brugada syndrome, ventricular aneurysm, and left bundle branch block.[47][48][49] ST-elevations are diffuse in acute pericarditis and associated with PR-depression about TP-segments (except for leads V1 and aVR).[50][51][52][53] In myocardial infarction, the ST elevation tends to be localized (inferior, anterior, posterior, lateral), often, but not always, with reciprocal ST depression.[54] Secondly, the PR segment displacement is attributable to the subepicardial atrial injury. PR elevation can present in aVR, and PR depression is best seen in II, aVF, and V4-V6. PR-depression and slight downsloping appearance of TP segments are often known as Spodick sign of pericarditis and help distinguish acute pericarditis from acute MI.[54] ST depression greater than 1 mm is often a sign of myocardial ischemia or angina. It can appear as a downsloping, upsloping, or horizontal segment on the ECG. A horizontal or downsloping ST depression greater than 0.5 mm at the J-point in two contiguous leads indicates myocardial ischemia. An upsloping ST depression in the precordial leads with prominent De Winter T waves is highly indicative of MI caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.[55] ST depression can represent a reciprocal change with a morphology that resembles "upside-down" ST elevation and is typically seen in leads electrically opposite to the site of infarction. For example, posterior wall MI manifests as horizontal ST depression in leads V1-3 and is associated with tall R waves and upright T waves. Likewise, inferior wall STEMI produces reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL, and there is often a reciprocal ST depression in leads III and aVF in lateral wall MI.[55] ST depressions are also associated with non-ischemic causes, including digoxin toxicity, hypokalemia, hypothermia, and tachycardia.[56] **QT Interval** It represents the start of depolarization to the end of the repolarization of ventricles. The normal QT interval duration is somewhat controversial, and various normal durations have been previously suggested. Generally, the normal QT interval is less than 400 to 440 milliseconds (ms), or 0.4 to 0.44 seconds. Women usually have a slightly longer QT interval than men. A QT interval has an inverse relation to the heart rate. A prolonged QT interval presents an imminent risk for serious ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. A common cause of QT prolongation includes medications, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, and congenital long QT syndrome.[57] A short QT interval ( less
