There are 2 types of amebic encephalitis, namely primary meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE). The initial symptoms of PAM are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, while the symptoms of GAE can mimic a brain abscess, encephalitis, or meningitis. These infections are almost uniformly fatal. The mortality rate is above 90%, despite antimicrobial therapy. This activity discusses the role of the interprofessional team, describes the causative agent of amebic meningoencephalitis, its pathophysiology, the clinical presentation, and highlights measures of prevention. **Objectives:** - Review the causative agents of amebic encephalitis. - Describe the clinical presentation of amebic encephalitis and plan the diagnostic evaluation and treatment. - Summarize the treatment and management options available for amebic encephalitis. - Outline the measures to prevent the disease and the treatment by the interprofessional team that will decrease the number of cases and improve outcomes.

The initial symptoms of PAM are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, while the symptoms of GAE can mimic a brain abscess, encephalitis, or meningitis. These infections are almost uniformly fatal. The mortality rate is above 90%, despite antimicrobial therapy.[4] ## Etiology PAM is caused by _Naegleria fowleri,_ a thermophilic, free-living ameba that lives in temperatures above 30 °C and can tolerate temperatures up to 45 °C. This protozoan parasite is found in the soil and freshwaters, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, hot springs, and unchlorinated
