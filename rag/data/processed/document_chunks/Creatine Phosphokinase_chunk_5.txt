represent a physiological finding in the first days of life. The suggested upper reference limits when standardized methods for CK determination are employed are males up to 170 U/L and females up to 145 U/L. With the CK-MB mass assay, the upper reference limit for males is 5.0 μg/L, and the value for females is lower. However, many laboratories use the male reference interval.[36] In populations who frequently exercise, such as well-trained, long-distance runners, the CK-MB content of skeletal muscle increases, which may produce abnormal serum CK-MB concentrations to separate non-myocardial infarction from myocardial infarction patients; a “relative index” (RI) is necessary.[37] The RI relates CK-MB mass concentration in μg/L to measured total CK activity in U/L.[38] Results are expressed as a percentage: physiological: ≤3%, equivocal: 3% to 5%, consistent with myocardial necrosis: >5%.[39] Blood sampling between 8 and 36 hours from symptom onset is necessary to use the RI. ## Clinical Significance CK activity is one of the markers of AMI.[40] The activity rises within 12 hours of AMI symptoms, peaks at 24 to 36 hours, and normalizes after 48 to 72 hours (see **Image.** Creatine Kinase Levels After a Myocardial Infarction). The issue with measuring CK activity for AMI is that it is non-specific to the heart. CK activity can increase in several conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis, chronic muscle diseases, burns, and strenuous exercise.[41] Although the CK-MB measurement is a diagnostic improvement over just CK, the enzyme can still increase in other conditions such as acute muscle injury, congestive cardiac failure, and arrhythmias.[42] Elevated CK-MB levels have long indicated the diagnosis of AMI. Although many centers are utilizing troponin levels instead of CK-MB, a newer, more specific CK-MB analysis method is used.[43] The new testing method involves measuring the values of the CK-MB1 and CK-MB2 isoforms. In a normal patient, the ratio of CK-MB2 to CK-MB1 should be 1 to 1. In the case of AMI, the ratio peaks within 4 hours of the infarction. However, some evidence of AMI can be detected as early as 1 to 2 hours after the infarction.[44] To diagnose AMI, the ratio of CK-MB2 to CK-MB1 should be greater than 1.7 to 1. However, a ratio greater than or equal to 1.5 to 1 strongly indicates AMI. Additional cardiac conditions that increase serum CK and CK-MB in the serum are coronary artery bypass surgery, cardiac transplantation, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism.[45] Serum CK
