sign (with depressed contractility of the right ventricular free wall compared to the right ventricular apex), is suggestive of PE.[55] A right ventricular/left ventricular diameter ratio of ≥1 and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) \<16 mm are the findings for which an association with unfavorable prognosis has most frequently been reported.[56] **Compression ultrasonography** PE originates from a lower-limb DVT in most patients and only rarely from upper-limb DVT (mostly following venous catheterization). One study found DVT in 70% of patients with proven PE.[57] Compression ultrasound has a >90% sensitivity and a specificity of about 95% for proximal symptomatic DVT.[58] A finding of proximal DVT in patients suspected of having PE is considered sufficient to warrant anticoagulant treatment without further testing.[59] Notably, due to the low sensitivity of compression ultrasonography, it is reserved for patients for whom definitive imaging (eg, CTPA, V/Q scanning) is contraindicated or indeterminate.[60] **Acute Pulmonary Embolus Diagnostic Criteria** Wells criteria and Geneva score are scoring systems most commonly used to estimate the pretest probability of having a PE. These systems allow patients with suspected PE to be classified into clinical or pretest probability categories based on which diagnostic tests are chosen and interpreted. **Revised Geneva clinical prediction rule** The following clinical decision rule points are used in the Geneva scoring system (original version)/(simplified version): - Previous PE or DVT: 3/1 - Heart rate - 75 to 94 bpm: 3/1 - ≥95 bpm: 5/2 - Surgery or fracture within the past month: 2/1 - Hemoptysis: 2/1 - Active cancer: 2/1 - Unilateral lower-limb pain: 3/1 - Pain on lower-limb deep palpation and unilateral edema: 4/1 - Age >65 years: 1/1 Using the Geneva criteria, the clinical probability of PE in a patient can be calculated using the following 3- or 2-level scoring systems: - Three-level score - Low: 0 to 3/0 to 1 - Intermediate: 4 to 10/2 to 4 - High: ≥11/≥5 - Two-level score - PE unlikely: 0 to 5/0 to 2 - PE likely: ≥6/≥3 **Wells criteria and modified Wells criteria** The Wells scoring system uses the following criteria: - Clinical symptoms of DVT: 3 - Other diagnoses less likely than pulmonary embolism: 3 - Heart rate >100 bpm: 1.5 - Immobilization for ≥3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks: 1.5 - Previous history of DVT or PE: 1.5 - Hemoptysis: 1 - Malignancy: 1 [61] Using the traditional or modified Wells
