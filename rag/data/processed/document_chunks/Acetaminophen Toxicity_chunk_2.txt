circulation.[7] **Distribution:** Acetaminophen exhibits low plasma protein binding of 10% to 25% and shows extensive distribution throughout the body, excluding fat tissue.[8] **Metabolism:** Acetaminophen undergoes primarily hepatic metabolism via first-order kinetics, utilizing 3 distinct pathways—conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation facilitated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, predominantly CYP2E1. CYP3A4 plays a limited role in acetaminophen metabolism. This process forms a reactive intermediate metabolite known as _N_ -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). At therapeutic doses, NAPQI swiftly combines with glutathione, subsequently undergoing further metabolism to generate cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[9] **Elimination:** Most acetaminophen metabolites are excreted in the urine, with less than 5% appearing as unconjugated or free acetaminophen. Over 90% of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. ## Administration **Available Dosage Forms** Acetaminophen can be administered through oral, rectal, or IV routes.[10] - Oral: Acetaminophen is available in various formulations, including tablets, capsules, syrup, oral solution, or suspension. - Rectal: Acetaminophen is available as a rectal suppository for adult and pediatric patients. - IV: Acetaminophen is also available as an IV infusion for administration. Tompkins et al conducted a literature review on the effectiveness of IV acetaminophen in postoperative pain control.[11] The investigators found a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of IV acetaminophen when compared to oral or rectal acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, or placebo across various surgical procedures, including abdominal, gynecological, genitourinary, orthopedic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and renal surgeries. The investigators conclude that IV acetaminophen offers limited clinical benefits compared to oral or rectal administration. Establishing the maximum daily allowable dosage of acetaminophen involves considering all modes of administration, including IV, oral, and rectal, as well as all formulations containing acetaminophen. **Dosages for Adults and Adolescents** **Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight of ≥50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. Notably, the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen should not exceed 4000 mg. **Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight \<50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. In addition, it is essential to adhere to a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen
