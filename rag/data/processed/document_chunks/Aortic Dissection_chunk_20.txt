minimize the risk of missed diagnoses. Establishing a detailed risk factor profile, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and being vigilant about atypical or subtle presentations are critical components of effective evaluation and diagnosis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of aortic dissection requires a coordinated, patient-centered approach involving a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including advanced clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied healthcare professionals. Each team member enhances patient outcomes and ensures safety. Clinicians, such as cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, lead diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. At the same time, advanced clinicians and nurses provide continuous bedside monitoring, patient education, and early recognition of complications. Pharmacists contribute by optimizing pharmacologic therapies, ensuring medication safety, and counseling patients on medication adherence and blood pressure management, which is critical for long-term prognosis. Open communication between team members is vital to improving outcomes.[22][28][29] Regular team meetings and a shared care plan help align treatment goals and strategies, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing patient safety. This approach ensures that all providers are aware of the patient’s status, recent interventions, and any changes in management plans. Care coordination extends beyond the acute phase, with outpatient follow-up and rehabilitation planning guided by the team's collective expertise, including social workers and psychologists, to address psychosocial needs and support the patient’s return to daily life. By integrating the unique skills of each healthcare professional, maintaining open channels of communication, and fostering a collaborative environment, the interprofessional team can deliver comprehensive, high-quality care that enhances patient-centered outcomes and overall team performance. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20603&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20603) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/aortic-dissection/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20603) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20603/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20603) [![Stanford Classification of Aortic Dissection](/books/NBK441963/bin/Aortic_dissection_types.gif)](/books/NBK441963/figure/article-20603.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK441963/figure/article-20603.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Stanford Classification of Aortic Dissection.
