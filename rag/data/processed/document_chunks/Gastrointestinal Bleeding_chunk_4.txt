signs and symptoms, intermittent bleeding pattern, and difficulty in visualization on endoscopy. On endoscopy, Dieulafoy lesion may be difficult to diagnose due to its small size or the presence of normal-appearing surrounding mucosa.[9] Excessive blood in the GIT may also prevent visualization and further delay diagnosis. For these reasons, physicians and endoscopists should consider this condition as a differential diagnosis for intermittent or massive GIT bleeding. Radiologists should also be aware of the subtle nature of this condition that may be missed in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding. Once diagnosed, endoscopy should be the preferred treatment since it has replaced invasive surgery due to better health care outcomes. During the evaluation of the lesion, it is essential to determine the focal point of the bleeding for the management of future episodes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=117755&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=117755) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/dieulafoys-lesion-causing-gastrointestinal-bleeding/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=117755) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/117755/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=117755) [![Image ](/books/NBK562267/bin/Gray532.gif)](/books/NBK562267/figure/article-117755.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK562267/figure/article-117755.image.f1/?report=objectonly) The celiac artery and its branches, Liver; Left Lobe, Stomach, Right Gastroepiploic artery, Greater omenta, Sleen, Caudate Lobe, Pylorus, Gall-bladder Henry Vandyke Carter, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons ## References 1.
