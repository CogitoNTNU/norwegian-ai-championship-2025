flank pain, ileus, hematuria, and prolonged high drainage outputs. A urinoma may also form. Laboratory derangements include elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Ureteral injury may be visualized intraoperatively by injecting a ureteral dye like indigo carmine into the urinary tract. Suspicious fluids in the surgical field may also be tested for creatinine, which is higher in urine than other tissue fluids. A retrograde pyelogram is an imaging study with contrast that can help detect ureteral leaks or obstructions (see **Image**. Normal Retrograde Pyelogram). Stenting with or without direct ureteral repair can treat ureteral injuries. Due consideration must be given to the ureteral blood supply to avoid ischemia, scarring, and necrosis. Ureter length may be increased by performing a reimplantation, psoas hitch technique, or Boari flap procedure.[34] ## Clinical Significance Key facts to keep in mind when considering clinical significance are as follows: - Given the ureteral arteries' locations, surgical exposure of the ureter entails an incision in the lateral abdominal region for the proximal segments and a medial pelvic incision for the distal portions. - The 3 areas of physiological clinical significance are the sites most commonly involved in obstructive conditions.[35] A retrospective study of 94 patients presenting to the emergency department for colic reported that 60.6% of renal stones were located at the UVJ.[36] This portion of the ureter is aperistaltic, has no circular smooth muscle layer, is anatomically the narrowest, and is surrounded by the detrusor and Waldeyer's sheath. - The ureters are peristaltic organs. These muscular tubes normally cannot be entirely visualized on a single contrast radiological image, as different portions will be dilated or constricted at any specific moment. Visualization of the entire ureter is known as columnization and suggests ureteral obstruction. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=30808&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=30808) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/30808/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=30808) [![Normal Retrograde Pyelogram](/books/NBK532980/bin/ureter_abdomen___pelvis.gif)](/books/NBK532980/figure/article-30808.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK532980/figure/article-30808.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Normal Retrograde Pyelogram.
