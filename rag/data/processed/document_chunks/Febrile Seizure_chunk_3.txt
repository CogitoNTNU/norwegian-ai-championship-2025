varies among individuals and changes with age and development. Infants have a higher risk of febrile seizures, but premature infants are at an even higher risk, especially those receiving postnatal corticosteroids.[10] Furthermore, infants generally have a lower seizure threshold, which may be modified by certain medications and water and electrolyte imbalances (eg, hyponatremia). Iron, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, selenium, calcium, and magnesium deficiencies increase the risk of febrile seizures.[5] No specific fever etiology is more likely to cause febrile seizures; however, 80% of viral infections rather than bacterial infections are commonly associated with febrile seizures.[11] _Roseolovirus_ is the most common virus associated with febrile seizures in the US and European countries and is observed in up to one-third of patients younger than 2 years.[12] Other studies have found that febrile seizures secondary to _Roseolovirus_ are associated with a higher incidence of complex features, recurrence, and febrile status epilepticus.[13][14] In Asian countries, however, influenza A has been frequently associated with febrile seizures. Other commonly associated viral infections include human _herpesvirus 7 (_ HHV-7), human coronavirus HKU1, adenovirus, RSV, cytomegalovirus, shigella, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Vaccines have also been shown to temporarily increase the risk of febrile seizures a few days postinoculation. These include the DTaP-IPV-Hib, MMRV, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, and some formulations of inactivated influenza vaccines. The risk, although low, is also slightly higher in those getting more than one vaccination at a time. One study found the maximum estimated absolute excess risk due to concomitant administration of IIV3, PCV, and DTaP-containing vaccines was 30 febrile seizures per 100,000 persons vaccinated compared with administration on separate days.[15] ## Epidemiology Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure in children between the ages of 6 months to 5 years. Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizures in childhood, with a slight male predominance of 1.6:1. Febrile seizures have an incidence of 2% to 5% of US and European children, which peaks between 12 to 18 months of age. A seasonal and diurnal association has also been observed in Japan, Finland, and the US, with more episodes occurring in the afternoon and winter months.[16] Some children have a single febrile seizure event, while 30% of children have multiple seizures during early childhood. ## Pathophysiology The exact pathophysiology of febrile seizures is not understood fully, but there is a recognized complex genetic predisposition, immaturity and vulnerability of the central
