of gas in tissues if the patient has necrotizing fasciitis. Ultrasound may be used to evaluate the gallbladder. CT scan is used to assess the abdomen for abscess, bowel perforation, or ischemia. ## Treatment / Management The below guidelines are derived from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines [17][18] **Source Control** 1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis for all patients. Initial empiric anti-infective therapy should have activity against all likely pathogens and adequate penetration of source tissue. 1. Removal of infected/necrotic tissue if it is the source of septic shock, ie, patients with cellulitis, abscess, infected devices, or purulent wounds. **Management of Shock** [19] 1. Measures are most effective if achieved within the first six hours of diagnosis. 1. Restore central venous pressure (CVP) to 8 mmHg to 12 mm Hg 1. Restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mm Hg 1. Restore superior vena cava saturation to 70% or mixed venous saturation to 65% 1. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (NS or albumin) and colloid (blood products) up to 80 ml/kg 1. Mechanical ventilation to reduce metabolic demand 1. First-line vasoactive agents (epinephrine in cold shock versus norepinephrine in warm shock) when fluid-refractoryNote: dopamine as a first-line agent has fallen out of favor given its inhibitory effect on the HPA axis, namely prolactin and growth hormone, which can confer immunologic dysfunction [20] **Enhancing Host Response** 1. Corticosteroids indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock and or in patients with low (unstimulated) basal cortisol levels less than 150 Î¼g/L) [21][22] 1. Addition of vasopressin indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock While central lines are not required for the resuscitation of patients with septic shock, they provide an accurate means of monitoring CVP and mixed venous oxygen. Remember that CVP and MVO2 are most accurate from a central line that lies within the right atrium; lower extremity central lines do not provide the most accurate data for monitoring these indices of resuscitation. Regarding the need for central venous access for the administration of vasoactive agents, a recent study showed that both dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine at high doses could be safely administered via peripheral venous access.[23] Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has not been shown to confer a survival benefit in more recent studies.[24] All studies comparing EGDT to standard practice have shown an increase in the administration of crystalloid and packed red blood cells in the first six hours and the placement of central lines.
