The etiologies of large bowel obstruction can be structural, such as from tumors, hernias, or volvulus, or functional, such as pseudo-obstruction. Patients with a competent ileocecal valve may experience closed-loop obstructions, leading to severe distension and pain, and are at higher risk for perforation. The obstruction frequently presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension, and a lack of bowel movements, but symptoms vary based on the cause and site of the blockage. Imaging studies are vital for diagnosing large bowel obstruction, distinguishing between mechanical causes, ileus, and pseudo-obstructions, and identifying any associated ischemia or necrosis. Management primarily involves bowel resuscitation and decompression; prompt intervention is essential to reduce morbidity, prevent ischemia, and manage complications such as perforation. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in recognizing large bowel obstruction, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional management approach to improve patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify the clinical features of large bowel obstruction. - Apply appropriate diagnostic studies to evaluate large bowel obstruction. - Apply evidence-based treatment options for patients with large bowel obstruction. - Implement interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with large bowel obstruction.

The obstruction can be either structural or functional. Patients with a competent ileocecal valve may have a closed-loop obstruction and be very ill upon presentation. Depending on the etiology of the obstruction, an individual may show symptoms before the acute presentation. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of large bowel obstruction is critical to provide prompt resuscitation and diagnosis to limit morbidity and improve outcomes.[1][2][3] In some cases, an obstruction is the first clinical sign of colorectal carcinoma, particularly left-sided carcinoma, and up to 25% of colorectal carcinomas present as large bowel obstruction.[4][5] A reported 8% to 13% of colorectal cancer cases are obstructed at
