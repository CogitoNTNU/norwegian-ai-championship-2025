found that the risk of fatal opiate toxicity doubled when opiates were taken with gabapentin, which is also known to depress respiration. Additionally, morbidity and mortality are influenced by the intent behind the opiate ingestion. Individuals attempting suicide often consume multiple drugs simultaneously, substantially increasing the risk of death. **Prognosis** If the patient does arrest in the setting of a pure opiate overdose, the cause in most cases is severe hypotension, hypoxia, and poor brain perfusion. The outcome for these individuals is poor. ## Complications Opiate toxicity can also produce complications beyond the typical respiratory and CNS adverse effects.[39][40][41] The most common ones are discussed in this section. **Acute Lung Injury** Acute lung injury is a well-known complication of heroin overdose. However, this condition may also occur after overdoses involving methadone and propoxyphene and is almost universally observed in patients who succumb to high doses of opiates. The exact mechanism by which opiates cause lung injury remains unclear, but the outcome is hypoventilation and hypoxia caused by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Clinically, heroin-induced lung injury presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, frothy sputum production, cyanosis, tachypnea, and ralesâ€”symptoms consistent with pulmonary edema. Acute lung injury has also been reported in children who ingest high doses of opiates. The presentation is very similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most cases resolve with aggressive airway management and oxygen therapy, including positive pressure ventilation. Standard medications for pulmonary edema are typically avoided, as diuretics may worsen hypotension.[42] **Infection** Complications of intravenous opioid use include abscesses, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Gram-positive bacteria, such as _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus,_ are the most common organisms involved. If these bacteria enter the systemic circulation, the risk of additional complications like epidural abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis increases. These conditions often present with symptoms such as fever and persistent back pain. Some individuals who inject drugs directly into the neck risk developing jugular vein thrombophlebitis, Horner syndrome, and pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery. Both peripheral and pulmonary emboli have been reported in people who inject opioids. Accidental injection into nerves may also cause permanent neuropathy. Endocarditis is a serious complication of intravenous drug use, often resulting from injecting illicit drug mixtures with contaminated needles. Diagnosing infectious endocarditis can be challenging due to the initially vague symptoms. While right-sided heart valves are most commonly affected, left-sided valves may also be involved in some cases. The tricuspid valve is the valve most
