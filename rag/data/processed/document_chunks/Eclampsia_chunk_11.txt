before 20 weeks of pregnancy or more than 48 hours postpartum, or extended period of unconsciousness).[11] Alternative potential diagnoses should be based on the patientâ€™s history and physical exam findings. Differential diagnoses to consider include: - Seizure disorders - Metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia) - Cerebral venous thrombosis - Space-occupying brain lesions - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome - Infectious meningitis or encephalitis - Chronic renal or hepatic disease - Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures - Antiphospholipid syndrome - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome - Amniotic fluid emboli - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - Toxins - Ruptured aneurysm - Intracranial hemorrhage [11] ## Prognosis Patients who have experienced eclampsia are at a higher risk of developing preeclampsia in future pregnancies, with a recurrence rate of approximately 25% for preeclampsia and 2% for eclampsia, especially if eclampsia occurred in the second trimester. Patients with eclampsia are associated with a 12-fold increased risk of cardiovascular complications, including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure during the same hospitalization.[11] Patients with preeclampsia have also been found to have an increased risk of several long-term conditions, including metabolic disorders, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the increased cardiovascular risk has also been demonstrated in the children of these patients.[10] Additionally, individuals with a history of eclampsia are more likely to develop seizure disorders later in life, though the absolute risk is low. Moreover, patients with eclampsia tend to report more daily cognitive challenges, memory loss, concentration difficulties, anxiety, depression, persistent headaches, vertigo, and visual disturbances compared to patients who had normotensive pregnancies.[11] ## Complications Eclampsia increases the risk of complications, including: - Placental abruption - HELLP syndrome - Disseminated intravascular coagulation - Pulmonary edema - Aspiration pneumonia - Cardiopulmonary arrest - Acute renal failure - Blood transfusion - Venous thromboembolism [11] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients diagnosed with hypertension or preeclampsia during pregnancy, as well as their family members, need to be educated on the signs and symptoms of eclampsia. They must be instructed to call emergency services immediately and bring the patient to the hospital as soon as possible. Patients should be counseled about the importance of their hypertensive medication and should regularly follow up with their obstetrician. **Eclampsia Prevention** Primary and secondary preventative strategies have been recommended to decrease the occurrence of eclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (60 to 150 mg daily) is a primary prevention of eclampsia, focused on stopping the disease before it starts.
