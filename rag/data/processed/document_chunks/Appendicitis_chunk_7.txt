pain. In addition, it is the preferred primary imaging modality in evaluating children and pregnant patients with suspected acute appendicitis. Ultrasonographic findings that indicate the possibility of acute appendicitis include an anteroposterior appendiceal diameter >6 mm, the presence of an appendicolith, and increased echogenicity of the periappendiceal fat. A specific ultrasonographic compressibility index and an appendiceal diameter of \<5 mm are used to exclude appendicitis. Certain factors can limit abdominal US in evaluating suspected acute appendicitis. One primary concern is the innate limitations of the modality in patients with obesity. The increased adipose tissue thickness in obese patients can make it more challenging to visualize the appendix and accurately assess for signs of appendicitis using ultrasound. Moreover, the graded compression technique during the abdominal US may be poorly tolerated in patients with complicated appendicitis and peritonitis.[27] **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** Abdominopelvic MRI is considered highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing acute appendicitis. However, its use in evaluating suspected acute appendicitis is limited due to high costs and the need for specialized radiologic expertise for accurate imaging interpretation. The indications for MRI evaluation of suspected acute appendicitis are limited to particular patient populations for whom radiation exposure is less desirable. This population most commonly involves pregnant patients. If accessible, MRI is the second-most preferred imaging modality in pregnant patients with suspected acute appendicitis. While protocols vary significantly, most encompass imaging in three planes using a swiftly-acquired sequence featuring T2 weighting, and a subset incorporates T2 fat-suppressed imaging. MRI findings consistent with acute appendicitis parallel those observed in other modalities, such as luminal distension and dilation, wall thickening, and free periappendiceal fluid.[28] **The Use of Scoring Systems in the Evaluation of Acute Appendicitis** Several scoring systems have been developed to diagnose acute appendicitis promptly. These scoring systems primarily utilize criteria derived from the medical history, physical examination, and the results of laboratory testing and imaging studies. The Alvarado scoring system has been used to evaluate suspected acute appendicitis since 1986, and the modified Alvarado scoring system is the most widely used in current practice. The modified Alvardo scoring system assigns a point value to diagnostic criteria as outlined: - 2 points each: tenderness in the right lower quadrant and leukocytosis - 1 point each: migratory right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, fever, nausea or vomiting, and anorexia The highest score an individual with suspected acute appendicitis can
