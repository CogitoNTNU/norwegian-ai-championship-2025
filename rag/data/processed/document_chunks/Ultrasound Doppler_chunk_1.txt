are converted to an audible flow signal.[2] Plethysmography: It measures the volume change within a vessel via light, known as photoplethysmography (PPG). Infrared light is emitted from and reflected back to the probe. The blood volume affects how much light is reflected, which produces a waveform that is recorded and plotted on a graph. This modality is typically performed under normal conditions and then again after inflation of an occlusive cuff.[3] Pulse volume recording (PVR): A form of plethysmography used to measure arterial flow qualitatively indirectly. To obtain a PVR, a cuff is inflated to about 65mmHg and then attached to a plethysmograph. With each pulse, the blood volume affects the pressure of the cuff, which is then recorded as an arterial contour.[4] PVR is also used to detect reactive hyperemia or the response in blood flow following a period of ischemia.[5] During this study, an occlusive cuff is placed above the ankle for up to 5 minutes and then rapidly deflated. PVR is monitored distally once the cuff is taken down.[6] ## Indications While there are no strict indications, non-invasive lower extremity studies are typically ordered for evaluation of arterial disease who present with the following: - Claudication: Effort followed by discomfort that improves with rest; pain that improves when legs are held to gravity, i.e., off the side of the bed - Ischemic rest pain - Nonhealing lower extremity wound For patients with advanced diabetes, symptoms can include: - Leg fatigue - Recurrent stenosis/occlusion of tibial vessels - Peripheral neuropathy Of note, if a patient has undergone previous lower extremity bypass surgery or arterial stenting, there is limited utility for ABI's with PVR and toe pressures, as artificial grafts and stents have different compressibility in comparison to native vasculature. These patients are typically evaluated initially with arterial Duplex or computed tomography angiography to image their bypass graft/intravascular stent to assess patency and velocities. Continuous-wave Doppler can also be used in a variety of settings to assess blood flow. During pregnancy, continuous-wave doppler is used to assess fetal heart rate prenatally as well as during labor.[7][8][9] Ultrasound is frequently used to evaluate heart and valve function, as well as assess vascular access in patients on dialysis and renal artery stenosis.[10][11][10] For the critically ill, continuous-wave doppler can be used in a transcranial fashion as an adjunct to document brain deterioration.[12][13] ## Potential Diagnosis **Differential diagnosis:** - Acute arterial occlusion
