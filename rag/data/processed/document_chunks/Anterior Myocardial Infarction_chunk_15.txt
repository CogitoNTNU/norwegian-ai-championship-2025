the pericardial sac. This requires pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage. - **Acute pericarditis:** AWMI can cause inflammation of the pericardium. - **Dressler syndrome:** Delayed autoimmune response following MI, characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and fever. It typically occurs weeks to months after the initial event. - **Sudden cardiac death:** AWMI increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), which can result in sudden cardiac death. - **Conduction abnormalities:** AWMI can lead to conduction abnormalities, including blocks at the level of the His bundle or below and bundle branch blocks. - **Left ventricular aneurysm:** In some cases, AWMI can form a left ventricular aneurysm, which is a localized abnormal bulging of the ventricular wall. Aneurysms can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Secondary prevention for acute coronary syndrome includes: - Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of further cardiovascular events and improves overall prognosis. - Strict blood pressure control helps reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and slows the progression of cardiovascular disease. - Achieving and maintaining good glycemic control. The target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level should be below 7% to minimize the risk of diabetic complications and improve long-term outcomes. - Aggressive management of dyslipidemia is vital in patients with AWMI. Statin therapy is typically prescribed to achieve target lipid levels, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events. - Maintaining a healthy body weight. A target body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/mÂ² is recommended. - Participation in a structured cardiac rehabilitation program is highly beneficial for patients with AWMI. Cardiac rehabilitation includes supervised exercise training, education on heart-healthy lifestyle modifications, and psychosocial support. It helps improve functional capacity, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Seeking emergency medical service as soon as possible is crucial for improving outcomes in anterior myocardial infarction. Therefore, upon arrival, obtaining an ECG is of the utmost importance, and guidelines recommend patients with suspected AMI should receive an ECG within 10 minutes of the first medical encounter. Patients should be well-informed of major PCI or non-PCI cardiac facilities nearby. Additionally, public awareness about the importance of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the availability of automatic external defibrillators can significantly improve survival rates for patients with AMI. Management decisions should be made considering the availability of a PCI facility at the
