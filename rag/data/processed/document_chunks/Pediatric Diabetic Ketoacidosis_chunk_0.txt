Clinically relevant forms of ketoacidoses include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), and starvation ketoacidosis. DKA is a potentially life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes. It typically occurs in the setting of hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency, which causes unopposed lipolysis and oxidation of free fatty acids and thereby results in ketone body production and a subsequent increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. Alcoholic ketoacidosis occurs in patients with chronic alcohol abuse, liver disease, and acute alcohol ingestion. Starvation ketoacidosis occurs after the body is deprived of glucose as its primary source of energy for a prolonged time, causing fatty acids to replace glucose as the major metabolic fuel. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and complications of ketoacidosis and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management. **Objectives:** - Review and contrast the typical presentations of diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketoacidosis. - Outline the typical evaluation done in diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketoacidosis. - Review the management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketoacidosis. - Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by ketoacidosis.

During catabolic states, fatty acids are metabolized to ketone bodies, which can be readily utilized for fuel by individual cells in the body. Of the three major ketone bodies, acetoacetic acid is the only true ketoacid chemically, while beta-hydroxybutyric acid is a hydroxy acid, and acetone is a true ketone. Figure 1 shows the schematic of ketogenesis where the fatty acids generated after lipolysis in the adipose tissues enter the hepatocytes via the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to form the various ketone bodies. This biochemical cascade is stimulated by the combination of low insulin levels and high glucagon levels (i.e., a low insulin/glucagon ratio). Low insulin levels, most often secondary to absolute or relative hypoglycemia as with fasting, activate
