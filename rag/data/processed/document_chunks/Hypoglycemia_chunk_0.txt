To achieve good outcomes, the diagnosis and management of factitious hypoglycemia must be defined. This activity outlines the evaluation, management, and complications of factitious hypoglycemia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of factitious hypoglycemia. - Describe the appropriate evaluation of factitious hypoglycemia. - Outline treatment and management options available for factitious hypoglycemia. - Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance factitious hypoglycemia and improve outcomes.

It remains one of the diagnostic challenges that endocrinologists face during their practice and usually leads to costly, unnecessary investigations to rule out other causes of hypoglycemia.[1] When insulin is self-injected, laboratory studies will show high plasma insulin levels in combination with low plasma C-peptide levels during the hypoglycemic episode. With sulfonylurea consumption, the clinical picture may mimic an insulinoma with high plasma levels of both C-peptide and insulin; a positive drug screen can render the diagnosis. ## Etiology Factitious hypoglycemia results from exogenous self-administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues medications (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides). Note that insulin-sensitizing drugs like metformin do not cause hypoglycemia.[1] ## Epidemiology Factitious hypoglycemia is more common in women with diabetes, especially during the third and fourth decades of life.[2][3] ## Pathophysiology Insulin synthesis occurs in the β-cells of the pancreas. Preproinsulin secreted from β-cells is cleaved into proinsulin, which is then converted into insulin and C peptide.[4] Insulin and c peptide are stored in secretory granules and will be released in the event of hyperglycemia. The liver will rapidly remove the circulating insulin, whereas C peptide remains in the circulation for a more extended period of time until cleared renally. The insulin to C peptide ratio in healthy individuals is usually less than one. A small quantity of proinsulin is also
