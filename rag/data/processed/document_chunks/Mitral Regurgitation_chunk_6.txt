device choice, and ensuring proper orientation.[29] Patients with severe leaflet prolapse, known as Barlow disease, were not included in the EVEREST trials due to their challenges for a successful TEER. The hypermobility of the leaflets makes them difficult to grasp, necessitating multiple large TEER devices to achieve significant height reduction of the redundant leaflet tissue and a longer-lasting reduction in MR, making the procedure even more challenging.[30] When considering TEER in secondary MR, it is important to differentiate patients with preserved left ventricular function and annular dilation (atrial functional MR) from those with left ventricular dysfunction and leaflet tethering. A subgroup analysis of the 2018 Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the Mitra Clip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation trial demonstrated that patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent TEER maintained a clinical benefit. However, they exhibited a worse prognosis compared to patients without atrial fibrillation.[31] Mitral annular calcification is a degenerative process that primarily affects the mitral valve annulus and is often associated with MR.[32] Grasping the thickened and stiffened leaflets in these cases can be challenging. Moreover, patients with reduced mitral valve area at baseline face an increased risk of high diastolic gradients across the mitral annulus. Recent study results suggest that, in select patients with mitral annulus calcification and severe MR, TEER therapy may be a safe and feasible option with comparable midterm outcomes.[33] A noteworthy concern in mitral valve surgery is that up to 35% of patients who have previously undergone surgical mitral valve repair at high-volume centers of excellence develop moderate to severe MR a decade after their initial repair.[34][35][36] Redo sternotomy in these patients is often associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality.[37] While results from some studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of TEER in these situations, further research is essential to assess its efficacy fully.[38][39][40] Recognizing individuals who have previously undergone surgical annuloplasty often have a reduced mitral valve area due to the presence of the annuloplasty ring is crucial. Given that more than 1 TEER device is typically needed to reduce MR effectively, the procedural team must exercise caution to prevent a subsequent increase in diastolic inflow gradients. In postsurgical mitral valve repair cases, the posterior mitral valve leaflet is often resected, resulting in a shorter and smaller posterior leaflet that can prove more challenging to grasp during the TEER procedure. An alternative strategy involves grasping
