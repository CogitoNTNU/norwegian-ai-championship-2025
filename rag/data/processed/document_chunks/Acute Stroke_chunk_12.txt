been shown to reduce mortality).[65] Recurrent seizures after stroke should be treated similarly to when they occur with other acute neurological conditions. Prophylactic use of antiseizure drugs is not recommended.[44] **Intracerebral Hemorrhage** Early identification and prevention of acute medical complications are essential in the first hours and days after ICH. Standardized protocols, including order sets, are recommended to reduce disability and mortality.[39] Additional recommendations include a formal dysphagia screening before initiating oral intake to reduce disability and the risk of pneumonia; hyperpyrexia treatment with antipyretics, standard cooling blankets, water-circulating surface cooling, or catheter-based cooling devices, and; glucose monitoring and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.[39][66][67][68] **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage** Secondary brain injury can occur due to ICH, IVH, ICP, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, or DCI. Medical complications are common and significantly impact outcomes. Reported complications include pyrexia, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac dysfunction, anemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and deep venous thrombosis. Critical care strategies should be directed at prevention, early detection, and targeted treatment, such as maintaining normothermia and normoglycemia.[34][69] ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Rehabilitative therapies are essential within the interdisciplinary team for facilitating a return to activities of daily living and enhancing the overall quality of life during the post-stroke recovery process. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the optimal timing and intensity of rehabilitation services. Some research suggests that very early mobilization (beginning within 24 hours of stroke onset) may harm outcomes and increase the risk of blood pressure-related issues and falls. Nevertheless, further research is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this matter.[70][71][72] Research suggests therapy services should ideally begin within 2 weeks of stroke onset. These services typically include physical, occupational, and speech therapies depending on the specific deficits observed. The primary goals of therapy services include fall prevention, enhancing gait and balance function, contracture and pressure ulcer prevention, return to activities of daily living, and improvement of dysarthria and aphasia, as appropriate to each respective discipline. Mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, task-specific training, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and cognitive therapeutic exercises are commonly used treatment approaches for addressing stroke-related deficits. Furthermore, transcutaneous electrical stimulation and taping or strapping techniques are used for managing post-stroke shoulder pain. However, further research is necessary to establish optimal rehabilitation approaches across the post-stroke recovery spectrum, as existing research often lacks conclusive evidence or is based on small sample sizes.[70][71][72][73][74] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Acute stroke is both preventable and treatable. Prevention can
