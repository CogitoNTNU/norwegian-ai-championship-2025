How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up? Ask about other symptoms, such as: - Shortness of breath - Nausea and vomiting - Fever - Diaphoresis - Cough - Dyspepsia - Edema - Calf pain or swelling - Recent illness Evaluate for any of the following risk factors: - ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes - Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation - Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes - Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines) Carefully review the patientâ€™s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use. Once you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Pneumonia should be considered in patients with a productive cough and/or recent upper respiratory infection (URI). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chest pain so ask about any reflux symptoms. New exercise routines or recent trauma may help support a musculoskeletal cause. [2] **Physical** The physical exam should include: - Full set of vitals, including blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms - General appearance, noting diaphoresis and distress - Skin exam for the presence of lesions (shingles) - Neck exam for jugular venous distension (JVD), especially with inspiration (Kussmaul sign) - Chest, palpate for reproducible pain and crepitus - Heart exam - Lung exam - Abdominal exam - Extremities for unilateral swelling, calf pain, edema, and symmetric, equal pulses ## Evaluation Many facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should order the following: - Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs) - Chest x-ray - Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase - Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated - Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade ## Treatment / Management **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** A complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS.
