The proposed BBB pathophysiologic mechanism suggests that eclampsia may result from disrupted cerebral blood flow autoregulation, similar to hypertensive encephalopathy. This disruption could cause BBB dysfunction, allowing fluids and proteins to enter brain tissue and potentially leading to seizures. The BBB, formed by endothelial cells in the capillaries, regulates the passage of molecules between the blood and the brain. Typically, the BBB maintains a stable environment for neural function by selectively allowing substances to cross and using specific ion channels and transporters to optimize conditions for synaptic signaling. Autoregulation in the cerebral circulation adjusts blood flow in response to changes in blood pressure, with vasoconstriction occurring at high pressures and vasodilation at low pressures.[11] Another proposed hypothesis is that elevated blood pressure from preeclampsia causes dysfunction of autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature, which causes hypoperfusion, endothelial damage, or edema.[15] During pregnancy, the body adapts to increased plasma volume, requiring adjustments in cerebral circulation to maintain consistent blood flow. Failure in these adaptations may increase BBB permeability, resulting in vasogenic edema, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury. Autoregulation dysfunction may lead to acute hypertension, increasing hydrostatic pressure, reducing cerebral vascular resistance, and potentially damaging microvessels, ultimately resulting in cerebral edema and eclampsia.[3] However, the observance of eclampsia in women without severe hypertension before seizures indicates that this is not the only underlying mechanism. Other proposed mechanisms include the impact of circulating factors in preeclampsia, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, which may exacerbate BBB dysfunction through oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, theories involving cerebral vasospasm and overregulation have been proposed, though studies indicate that overperfusion, rather than vasospasm, might be more relevant to the onset of eclamptic seizures.[11] ## Histopathology Autopsy findings in eclampsia often reveal significant gross cerebral pathology, including extensive brain swelling, white matter hemorrhages, and tissue necrosis.
