brain death in 8.9% of cases post-resuscitation. For those presenting with TBI, the rate of progression to brain death ranges from 2.8% to 6.1%. Regarding intracranial etiologies, patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage progress to brain death in 8.5% to 10.7% of cases, while those with intracerebral hemorrhage progress at a rate of 6.1% to 9.6%.[11][12] Notably, by definition, brain death is associated with a 100% mortality rate. ## Pathophysiology The physiology of brain death is similar regardless of the etiology. Inadequate tissue oxygenation leads to a progressive cascade of further edema, increasing intracranial pressure (ICP), a further decrease in cerebral perfusion and eventual herniation, or complete cessation of blood flow and aseptic necrosis of brain tissue. In anoxic brain injuries, inadequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation following a cardiopulmonary arrest, tissue hypoxia leads to the release of cytotoxic material that leads to progressive cerebral edema and eventually the cascade described above. For TBIs or other intracranial injuries, increasing ICP leads to a decrease in CPP and prevents adequate oxygenation of neuronal tissues. This situation will result in further injury, edema, and, eventually, the process initially described above.[3][12] ## Histopathology Microscopic evaluation of postmortem brain-dead patients reveals varying degrees of neuronal ischemic changes. The hemispheric lobes and basal ganglia are the most common areas to experience severe ischemic change, followed by the pons, medulla oblongata, midbrain, and thalamus, respectively. Autolysis of the cerebellum can also be appreciated in many autopsies.[13] ## History and Physical Once the decision to proceed with the brain death determination has been made, three conditions must be present: coma, the absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea. Coma should be evaluated by ensuring a lack of responsiveness to noxious stimuli; no eye or motor reflex should be present in response to stimuli. Spinal-mediated reflex movements, including muscle stretch reflexes, may be compatible with brain death.[14] Additionally, the cause of the coma should be identified by neuroimaging, history, and physical examination or laboratory testing. The following cranial nerve (CN) and brainstem reflexes should be tested in the physical examination of a patient eligible for brain death evaluation.[15] They all must be absent for a patient to be diagnosed as brain dead: - CN II and III (pupillary light reflex): Pupils should be fixed, mid-size/dilated (4-9 mm), and not reactive to light. A magnifying glass or pupillometer can be used to evaluate further if the results are equivocal.[16] - CN III, VI, VIII
