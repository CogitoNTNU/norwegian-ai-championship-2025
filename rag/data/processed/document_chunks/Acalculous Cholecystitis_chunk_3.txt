At times, sludge or viscous bile can be seen. These findings can be precursors to gallstone formation due to increased bile salts or stasis. Various species of bacteria can be present in 11% to 30% of cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, also known as adenomyomatosis, are often present in specimens of chronic cholecystitis. These are herniations of intraluminal sinuses from increased intraluminal pressure, possibly associated with ducts of Luschka, which are small aberrant bile ducts found along the gallbladder fossa. The gallbladder mucosa will exhibit varying degrees of inflammation, from mild to moderate ulcerations with gangrenous changes. Extreme situations may show total gangrenous changes of the gallbladder with perforation.[15] ## Toxicokinetics Mild cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis are usually only treated for symptoms of biliary colic, but more severe cases can lead to sepsis and shock. The pressurized, static intraluminal bile can be susceptible to bacterial seeding. Antibiotics are usually ineffective because they do not treat the increased intraluminal pressure and subsequent ischemia. Eventual gallbladder perforation will lead to bile peritonitis and contribute to the body's systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. ## History and Physical Acute acalculous cholecystitis may present similarly to calculous cholecystitis. Patients typically present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain that worsens with fatty foods, physical exam findings of right upper quadrant tenderness, and a positive Murphy's sign (ie, inspiratory arrest from pain during palpation of the right upper quadrant). Fever, chills, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and food intolerance may also be present. These patients are often already admitted to the ICU for another severe illness or are recovering from extensive surgery. Critically ill patients unable to participate in the physical exam may have fevers of unknown origin or grimacing during abdominal palpation, which should prompt additional testing. ## Evaluation **Laboratory Studies** Preliminary laboratory studies typically include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and lipase levels. Findings of leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin, are common. **Ultrasound Imaging** Ultrasound is usually the initial image obtained, as this can be completed at the bedside in a timely fashion and is cost-effective. Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm, gallbladder wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid are indicative of cholecystitis (see **Image**. Acalculous Cholecystitis). **Additional Diagnostic Studies** The test of choice for diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of a normal ultrasound is a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, which may be done
