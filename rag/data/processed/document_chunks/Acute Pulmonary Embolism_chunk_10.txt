a first-line test for diagnosing PE due to its low sensitivity, low availability in most emergency settings, and the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans.[50] However, clinicians may consider this imaging option to evaluate PE in patients in whom neither CTPA nor V/Q scan can be performed. Potential advantages include no exposure to radiation. MR pulmonary angiography was studied prospectively in 371 adults with suspected PE. Among the 75% of patients with technically adequate images, MRPA alone showed a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 99%, respectively.[50] Among the 48% of patients with technically adequate images, MR pulmonary angiography and MR pulmonary venography have shown a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. **Echocardiography** Transthoracic echocardiography can rarely definitively diagnose PE when the thrombus is visualized in the proximal pulmonary arteries. The diagnosis of PE on echocardiography is supported by the presence of a clot in the right heart or new right heart strain, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected PE. An echocardiogram may be helpful to establish a possible diagnosis and justify the emergency use of thrombolytic therapy (see **Image.** Transesophageal Echocardiography, Pulmonary Embolism). Significant considerations are apparent when using echocardiography to establish a diagnosis of PE. Given the right ventricular's peculiar shape, no single echocardiographic parameter gives quick and accurate right ventricular size or function information. That is why echocardiographic criteria for diagnosing PE have varied between different studies. Because of the negative predictive value of 40% to 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE.[51][52] On the other hand, signs of right ventricular overload or dysfunction may also be present without acute PE and may be due to coexisting cardiac or respiratory disease.[53] Right ventricular dilation is seen in ≥25% of patients with PE on echo and is helpful for risk stratification of the disease.[54] More specific echocardiography findings confer a high positive predictive value for PE with preexisting cardiorespiratory illness. This includes the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the right ventricular outflow tract) \<60 milliseconds with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient less than 60 mm Hg ('60/60' sign) or McConnell sign (with depressed contractility of the right ventricular free wall compared to the right ventricular apex), is suggestive of PE.[55] A right ventricular/left ventricular diameter ratio of ≥1 and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) \<16 mm are the findings for which an association with unfavorable prognosis has most frequently
