and decreases reabsorption, reducing serum calcium and phosphate levels. In bone, calcitonin prompts osteoclast contraction, thereby diminishing their motility and capacity to resorb bone. Osteoclasts are recognized to undergo retraction and escape the sustained impacts of calcitonin administration within 24 to 48 hours, thereby reducing its long-term potency. Calcitonin also inhibits carbonic anhydrase II, disrupting the optimal acidic environment necessary for osteoclast activity. Furthermore, calcitonin hinders the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into their mature form.[19][20] This cumulative effect reduces bone matrix resorption and lowers serum calcium levels, albeit with diminishing efficacy over 1 to 2 days. **Pharmacokinetics** Absorption: Calcitonin is available in different formulations, including nasal spray and SQ and IM injections. The bioavailability of calcitonin varies depending on the route of administration. Intranasal administration leads to gradual absorption, with peak plasma concentrations attained within 15 to 40 minutes and a 3% bioavailability. SQ and IM injections yield peak plasma concentrations within 15 to 30 minutes and bioavailability of approximately 66%. Distribution: Calcitonin disperses throughout the body following its absorption. The drug exhibits a relatively short half-life, ranging from minutes to hours. Calcitonin readily attaches to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, at a rate of approximately 30% to 40%. The drug distributes across various body tissues, with the highest concentrations observed in the kidneys, bones, and central nervous system. In addition, calcitonin displays a volume of distribution ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 L/kg. Metabolism: The primary metabolic processes for calcitonin involve enzymatic breakdown by proteolytic enzymes, which predominantly occur in the kidneys and other tissues. Elimination: Calcitonin and its metabolites are excreted from the body via urine and feces. ## Administration **Available Dosage Forms** Patients can administer calcitonin through a nasal spray or SQ or IM injection. All these formulations are rapidly absorbed in the body and exhibit an onset of action within less than 30 minutes. **Strength** The strength of calcitonin varies depending on the administration method. For SQ and IM injections, the available strength of the medication is 200 IU/mL. When using the nasal spray, each actuation delivers 200 IU of calcitonin. **Adult Dosage** The injectable solution of calcitonin has a concentration of 200 units/mL, whereas the nasal solution delivers 200 units per actuation. Nasal administration of the medication offers a bioavailability of only 25% of the injectable form and is characterized by a slower absorption rate. In the injectable form, the SQ route is preferred for volumes less
