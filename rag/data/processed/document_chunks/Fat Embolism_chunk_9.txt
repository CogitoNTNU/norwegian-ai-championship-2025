develops fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome, intubation, and mechanical ventilation might be required. **Albumin** Albumin is recommended as part of the resuscitation tools for hypovolemia. It restores intravascular volume and helps to bind free fatty acids. This prevents the systemic dissemination of fat globules. **Indications for Intubation** - Altered mental status with Glasgow coma score of less than 8 - Moderate to several respiratory distresses with no improvement in noninvasive support FES might also cause pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure. Inotropic support with dobutamine or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor like milrinone might be required. Cerebral edema, if present, might require management with the following: - Mannitol - Hypertonic saline - Intracranial pressure monitors ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of fat embolism and FES are related to each system that this system disease affects **Respiratory** FES and fat embolism should be distinguished from pulmonary contusion, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism. CT of the chest can aid in distinguishing FES from other pathologies of the lung. Pulmonary contusion typically develops after about 6 to 10 hours of a chest injury. On CT of the chest, there is a localized ground glass opacification on the lung. In pulmonary edema, there is symmetrical vascular engorgement with pleural effusion and ground-glass opacification. The gold standard for diagnosis of thromboembolism is a CT angiogram of the chest where, classically, a filling defect is present. **Central Nervous System** Clinical conditions affecting the central nervous system that should be considered in the differential diagnosis: - Meningitis - Encephalitis - Brain tumor - Epidural - Subdural - Subarachnoid bleed All the conditions listed above can cause altered mental status with a change in the Glasgow Coma Scale mimicking FES. CAT scan of the brain can help delineate a bleed or tumor. Meningitis and encephalitis can be ruled out with a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis **Skin Rash** The following conditions can present with petechial skin rashes - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - Leukemia All these blood disorders should be considered in the presence of skin rash and other associated clinical signs and symptoms. Consultation with a hematologist/oncologist and dermatologist can help in the clinical diagnosis. ## Prognosis In patients with traumatic FES, the prognosis depends on early open reduction and internal fixation of the long bone fracture. Most patients with adequate support therapy can recover from the neurological, respiratory, and retinal changes
