Event staff, EMS and frontline healthcare providers, and military members should also be educated on recognizing EAH in the field and prevention measures via avoiding overhydration and adequate oral intake.[3][7] ## Pearls and Other Issues The Defence Health Agency released a Practice Recommendation on the management of EAH in December 2020 to improve military-wide awareness of EAH and care for service members who develop it. _The views expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy of the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government._ ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Prompt recognition of EAH over other exertional injuries is imperative. Patients with confirmed or suspected EAH should be transferred to a tertiary care center for advanced care. EAH diagnoses must be clearly communicated at transfers of care to ensure appropriate fluid management. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=133173&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=133173) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/hormones-and-body-chemistry/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=133173) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/133173/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=133173) ## References 1.
