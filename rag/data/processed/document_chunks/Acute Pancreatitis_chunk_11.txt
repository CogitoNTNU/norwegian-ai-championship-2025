with the development of a higher incidence of fluid overload in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation without improvement in clinical outcomes. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Acute pancreatitis is a severe disorder. The most effective way to manage the condition is with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including a surgeon, radiologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, intensivist, gastroenterologist, pharmacist, nurse, and addiction specialist. The 3 major causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcohol, and medications. The emphasis should be on prevention. The nurse and pharmacist are in the prime position to educate the patient on lowering their risks of acute pancreatitis by abstaining from alcohol, losing weight, eating a low-fat diet, and reducing their lipid profile. In addition, the pharmacist can re-evaluate all the medications and recommend discontinuing those associated with pancreatitis.[36][37][38] It is incumbent on all team members to exercise open communication with the rest of the team and to keep meticulous records of every interaction or intervention with the patient so that everyone involved in care can access the same accurate, updated patient data. This interprofessional approach yields the best possible patient results. **Outcomes** Acute pancreatitis is a severe disorder that still carries a mortality of 5 to 15%, depending on the cause, patient age, and comorbidity. Patients with gallstone pancreatitis generally have higher mortality than those with alcoholic pancreatitis. In addition, the presence of type 2 diabetes significantly increases the risk of complications and death. In patients with multiorgan involvement, the mortality can be as high as 20%. Most deaths are due to multiorgan failure and hypotensive shock. Various classifications have been developed to assess the prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis, but most are cumbersome for practical use.[39][40][41] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26578&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26578) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/acute-pancreatitis-pancreatitis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26578) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26578/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26578) [![Signs and Symptoms of Acute Pancreatitis](/books/NBK482468/bin/medical1-01.gif)](/books/NBK482468/figure/article-26578.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK482468/figure/article-26578.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Signs and Symptoms of Acute Pancreatitis.
