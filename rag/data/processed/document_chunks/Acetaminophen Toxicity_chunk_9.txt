after ingestion is 10 μg/mL or lower, further measurements are unnecessary, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment is not required. Conversely, if any concentration exceeds the treatment line, NAC is indicated. If the acetaminophen concentration measured within the same time frame falls between 10 μg/mL and the treatment line on the revised nomogram, and clinical signs indicating anticholinergic or opioid toxicity are present, a reevaluation should be scheduled 4 to 6 hours following the initial measurement. Notably, the dosing and duration of NAC treatment strictly follow the established standard protocol for acetaminophen ingestions. The panel recommends hemodialysis with NAC in massive acetaminophen toxicity with a concentration exceeding 900 μg/mL, accompanied by acidosis or altered consciousness.[27] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The prevention of acetaminophen toxicity is of utmost importance, and an interprofessional healthcare team comprising clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists plays a critical role. Pharmacists and nurses need to emphasize the daily maximum permitted dose of acetaminophen. Patients should be educated on identifying acetaminophen in various medications and calculating the dosages when combining products. Pharmacists are responsible for conducting medication reconciliation to assess potential drug interactions and ensuring that the patient's regimen does not include an excessive amount of acetaminophen-containing drugs. Pharmacists should report any concerns to the nurse and prescriber. All healthcare team members must document their findings and inform the entire team regarding the patient's case. With the recent changes in maximum daily dosing for acetaminophen, all interprofessional healthcare team members must be aware of the new guidelines, and they should remain current and stay vigilant for any emerging guidance in the field. In cases of toxicity or suspicion of toxicity, effective management necessitates the collaboration of an interprofessional team comprising clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Specific protocols have been designed to direct the interprofessional healthcare team when patients present to emergency departments with acute acetaminophen toxicity. Developing such protocols involves the input of emergency physicians, nurses, toxicologists, pharmacists, and psychiatrists.[28] Furthermore, dentists can also become involved when the overdose is secondary to dental procedures.[29] As outlined above, patients should receive clear instructions on APAP medication management upon discharge. Although acetaminophen has been available for many years and is generally considered safe, a coordinated interprofessional team effort is necessary to prevent avoidable toxicity by accounting for all sources of acetaminophen in the patient's medication profile. Based on a recent study, it was found that after the FDA's
