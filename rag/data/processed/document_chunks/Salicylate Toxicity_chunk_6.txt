are rare, animal and radiological studies have demonstrated the potential for long-term adverse effects. In MDMA-treated monkeys, a loss of serotonin axon terminal markers was observed, leading to deficits in emotion, memory, and high-order cognitive processes. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans in baboons showed significant decreases in radioactivity levels in various brain areas. Similarly, human volunteers with a history of MDMA use underwent PET scanning and were found to have a global dose-related reduction in a structural element of serotonin. Further studies on PET scans of volunteers with a history of MDMA abuse showed similar effects, along with changes in the amygdala and neocortex regions. Deficits in short-term memory, visual memory, verbal memory, and reasoning seem to be associated. The cerebrovascular systems may also be affected, causing a decline in cognitive abilities that can resemble dementia.[36][37] ## Complications Complications of MDMA toxicity include the following: - Neurologic complications include delirium and seizures [23] - Cardiovascular complications include cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages [8][20][21] - Gastrointestinal complications include severe hepatotoxicity, which can lead to fulminant liver failure [22] - Renal complications include rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure [25] - Endocrine complications include the development of a syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH), resulting in life-threatening hyponatremia and seizures - Patients can also present with life-threatening hyperthermia mimicking heat stroke [25][26][27] - Other complications include increased psychomotor agitation or muscle activity (such as bruxism, restless legs, and jaw clenching), hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness [14] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patient education is crucial in helping patients understand both the short- and long-term risks associated with MDMA use. Many users incorrectly perceive MDMA as a safe drug with few adverse effects. Tolerance develops rapidly, and those who respond by ingesting larger doses are at risk for complications that include sympathetic hyperactivity, potentially resulting in hyperthermia, arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability. Patients must also understand the long-term psychiatric implications that accompany regular use. There are reports of depression, paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia lasting years following cessation of MDMA use. Additionally, research shows correlations between MDMA use and impaired concentration and memory.[38] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes MDMA toxicity can be life-threatening and involve multiple organ systems, necessitating an interprofessional approach. Providers need to be prepared to treat potential toxicities because treatment is mainly supportive. This requires an interprofessional team approach to managing toxicity, including education, interventions, monitoring,
