Sepsis is caused by conditions that threaten the functional integrity of the host, such as microbial invasion. This activity illustrates the management of sepsis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Review the pathophysiology of bacterial sepsis. - Describe the typical lab findings in bacterial sepsis. - Summarize the components of the acute sepsis bundle and the components of the sepsis management bundle used in the evaluation and treatment of patients with sepsis. - Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by sepsis.

Sepsis has recently been re-defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.[1] Sepsis, as a medical condition, was first introduced by Hippocrates (460 through 470 BC) and is derived from the Greek word _sipsi_ , i.e., “to make rotten.”[2] This disease entity has had many iterations since that time, with the foundations for the modern understanding of sepsis coming about through breakthroughs in the late 19 century. The development of antiseptic measures, the germ theory of disease, and bacteriology lead to the widely held belief that sepsis was a systemic infection resulting from a pathogenic organism invading the host that spreads via the bloodstream (i.e., septicemia). It was not until the further widespread use of antibiotics and the discovery of endotoxin that suggested the pathophysiology of sepsis was far more complex.[3][4] Despite the increased understanding of this complex disease process, mortality from sepsis remains the most common cause of death in the non-coronary intensive care unit.[5] In the hopes of allowing earlier therapeutic intervention, an international consensus meeting in 1991 created and defined terms, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (known now as
