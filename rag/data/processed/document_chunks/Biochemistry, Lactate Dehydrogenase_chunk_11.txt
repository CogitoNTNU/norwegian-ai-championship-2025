a ‘flipped’ ratio of LDH-1/LDH-2 greater than 1. The increase in LDH persists for approximately ten days. It increases at 12 hours and peaks at 24-48 hours. A very high level thus indicates acute myocardial infarction. - Greater than a 50 times increase in LDH-1 and LDH-2 indicates megaloblastic anemia. - Increased LDH-5 in serum is a marker for muscular dystrophy. - A ten times increase in serum LDH indicates toxic hepatitis with jaundice. - An increase in LDH-3 is associated with the massive destruction of platelets as in pulmonary embolism. - LDH is used to assess the nature, or pathological accumulation of pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial fluids. Serum LDH, compared to serous fluid LDH, helps in distinguishing exudate from transudate effusions. - In patients with non-seminomatous testicular cancer LDH is used as a staging (S classification) marker. - Abnormally low levels of LDH are very rare and usually not considered harmful. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=24001&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=24001) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/24001/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=24001) ## References 1.
