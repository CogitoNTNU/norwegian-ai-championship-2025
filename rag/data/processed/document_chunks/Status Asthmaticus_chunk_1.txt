This respiratory condition is characterized by inflammation of the airways, causing intermittent airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The hallmark asthma symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, which can be frequently exacerbated by triggers ranging from allergens to viral infections. The prevalence and severity of asthma are determined by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Despite treatment advancements, disparities persist in asthma care, with variations in access to diagnosis, treatment, and patient education across different demographics. The development of asthma, often presenting in childhood, is associated with other atopic features, such as eczema and hay fever.[1][2][3] Severity varies from intermittent symptoms to life-threatening airway closure. Healthcare professionals establish a definitive diagnosis through patient history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and appropriate laboratory testing. Spirometry with a post-bronchodilator response (BDR) is the primary diagnostic test. Treatment focuses on providing continued education, routine symptom assessment, access to fast-acting bronchodilators, and appropriate controller medications tailored to disease severity. ## Etiology **Genetics** Asthma manifests with diverse phenotypes, likely influenced by intricate interactions between genetic and environmental factors.[4][5] Genomewide association studies have linked childhood-onset asthma to markers near the ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (_ORMDL3_) and gasdermin B (_GSDMB_) genes on chromosome 17q21, encoding ORM1-like protein 3 and gasdermin-like protein.[6] Other associations include genes such as interleukin-33 (_IL33_), IL-1 receptor-like 1 (_IL1R1_) genes, and a novel susceptibility locus at the IF-inducible protein X (_PYHIN1_) gene, particularly affecting individuals of African descent.[7] The EVE Consortium also identifies a susceptibility locus for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (_TSLP_), an epithelial cell–derived cytokine implicated in asthma-related inflammation initiation.[8] Asthma patients exhibit higher _TSLP_ expression in their airways compared to healthy controls. Additional genetic loci involved in asthma include major histocompatibility complex class II DQ α1 (_HLA-DQA1_), HLA-DQB1 antisense RNA 1 (_HLA-DQB1_), Toll-like receptor 1 (_TLR1_), IL-6 receptor (_IL6R_), zona pellucida-binding protein 2 (_ZPBP2_), and gasdermin A (_GSDMA_). Genetics may also be pivotal in asthma treatment. The hydroxy-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3-beta- and steroid δ-isomerase 1 (_HSD3B1_) genotype is associated with glucocorticoid resistance among patients. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (_PRKG1_)\_\_ and SPATA13 antisense RNA 1 (_SPATA13-AS1_)\_\_ are associated with BDR in Black children.[9] Differing concordance rates among monozygotic twins suggest
