PET-CT is useful in most malignant lesions, and concerning mediastinal masses, it is typically used for lymphoma, esophageal, and lung malignancies. Lymphomas are avid FDGs, and PET-CTs are helpful in staging and restaging the disease. Thymic tumors can also demonstrate FDG uptake.[12] It is a very useful modality to assess the treatment response of neoplasms. **I-131** **M** **eta-** **iodobenzylguanidine** **(MIBG) Study** I-131 MIBG study is used to confirm the presence of a mediastinal pheochromocytoma.[13] ## Angiography This invasive technique for assessing vascular abnormalities was performed more commonly in the past, before the advent of CT. The downside is the high dose of ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast. An added advantage of this technique is that it can also be used for treatment. Bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis is 1 of the most common indications for this study.[14] ## Patient Positioning The patient's positioning depends on the modality. For example, PA or posteroanterior film is obtained with the patient facing the cassette and an x-ray beam projecting from the posterior aspect of the patient to the anterior aspect. In an anteroposterior (AP) view, the cassette is along the posterior aspect of the patient. Portable radiographs are obtained in the ICU when the patient cannot erect. CT chest is performed with the patient supine. The arms are usually above the level of the head. MRI and PET scans are also obtained with the patient in the supine position. Ultrasound is also obtained with the patient, who is usually supine. However, this being a dynamic procedure, the patient can move during the procedure. ## Clinical Significance In conclusion, given the numerous structures and extensive differential diagnosis of mediastinal lesions, accurate diagnosis is important and dependent on appropriate imaging and assessment. While plain radiographs and CT chest are the most common modalities, MRI and PET-CT provide additional value in evaluating these lesions. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17034&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17034) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17034/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17034) ## References 1.
