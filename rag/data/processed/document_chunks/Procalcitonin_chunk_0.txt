Calcitonin is a peptide hormone consisting of 32 amino acids, primarily synthesized by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the human thyroid gland. Extensive research has been conducted on salmon calcitonin, revealing its heightened potency compared to the human variant, thus establishing it as the preferred option in clinical application. The drug's clinical significance derives from its ability to inhibit osteoclast activity and increase renal excretion of calcium. Through these mechanisms, the resorption of bone matrix and serum calcium levels are diminished. Owing to these reasons, calcitonin proves advantageous in addressing the aforementioned conditions. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacokinetics, and monitoring recommendations of calcitonin to enhance the competence of interprofessional healthcare team members when caring for patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and hypercalcemia. **Objectives:** - Identify the appropriate indications for calcitonin therapy, including postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and hypercalcemia. - Screen patients for contraindications, allergies, and potential interactions before initiating calcitonin therapy. - Implement proper patient dosing regimens based on specific clinical conditions and patient characteristics. - Coordinate the patient care plan with the interprofessional team to manage potential drug interactions and optimize treatment outcomes.

Copp and Cheney who isolated and characterized the hormone from the ultimobranchial gland of fish. In subsequent years, calcitonin was identified in various other species, including mammals. The recognition of the drug's physiological role in calcium regulation led to the exploration of calcitonin's therapeutic potential of calcitonin. Calcitonin is a peptide hormone consisting of 32 amino acids, primarily synthesized by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the human thyroid gland. The hormone exists in different forms, including salmon calcitonin, human calcitonin, and synthetic analog.
