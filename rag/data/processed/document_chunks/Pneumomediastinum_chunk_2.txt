or blunt trauma (i.e., motor vehicle accident) may cause tracheal or esophageal injury. Though not well described, blasts may also cause secondary pneumomediastinum.[5] Iatrogenic trauma (e.g., endoscopy or endotracheal intubation) may result in similar injuries.[8] ## History and Physical In gathering the history, it is important to identify any existing risk factors for pneumomediastinum as well as preceding events. Key elements of the history include: - History of smoking or recreational drug use - History of airway or lung disease - History of excessive vomiting or coughing - Recent history of instrumentation - History of blunt or penetrating trauma The most common symptom of pneumomediastinum is retrosternal chest pain (60 to 100% of patients), which may radiate to the neck or back. Pain is typically acute in onset and may be preceded by excessive coughing or vomiting. Other symptoms include: - Dyspnea (75% of patients) - Coughing spells (80% of patients) - Neck pain (36% of patients) - Odynophagia - Dysphagia - Emesis - Abdominal pain The most common sign on physical exam is subcutaneous emphysema (70% of patients). An uncommon but specific sign that may be present is the Hamman sign, a mediastinal crunch or click synchronous with the heart sounds auscultated over the cardiac apex. Other signs include: - Rhinolalia (nasal tone of speech) - Dysphonia - Hoarseness - Neck swelling - Tachycardia - Tachypnea Rarely, patients may present with malignant pneumomediastinum, which is severe pneumomediastinum that obstructs the great vessels of the heart resulting in cardiac tamponade physiology.[3] ## Evaluation Pneumomediastinum is usually diagnosed on chest X-ray. The most common finding is air outlining mediastinal structures (90% of cases).[8] Lateral chest x-rays are rarely needed. Other signs on chest x-ray include: - Subcutaneous emphysema - Elevation of the thymus in pediatric patients (spinnaker sign) - Air surrounding the pulmonary arteries of the lung (ring sign)[8] - A hyperlucent V shape between the descending aorta and the left hemidiaphragm[9] - Double bronchial wall - Continuous diaphragm sign - Pleural effusion (which may indicate esophageal injury)[7] If chest x-ray findings are equivocal, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest can definitively rule in or rule out pneumomediastinum.[9] CT scans can detect very small amounts of air in the mediastinum or subcutaneous tissues and can differentiate between pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium, which can be difficult to do on a chest X-ray. In emergent situations, ultrasound may be helpful in identifying
