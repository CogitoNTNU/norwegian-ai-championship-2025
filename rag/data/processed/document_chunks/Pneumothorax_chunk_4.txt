from escaping. The increasing intrapleural pressure leads to a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, compression of the vena cava, and decreased cardiac output, ultimately resulting in severe hypotension and hypoxia. On physical examination, classic findings of tension pneumothorax include absent breath sounds on the affected hemithorax, tracheal deviation to the contralateral side, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention. If left untreated, tension pneumothorax rapidly leads to hemodynamic collapse and death. Patients on mechanical ventilation who develop pneumothorax due to barotrauma experience a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure and hemodynamic instability, often presenting more abruptly compared to those breathing spontaneously.[27] Early recognition is critical in these cases, as symptoms may rapidly progress to cardiorespiratory failure. ## Evaluation The diagnosis of pneumothorax is based on a combination of patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, with chest x-rays being the primary imaging modality (see **Image.** Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax). However, small pneumothoraces are often missed on physical examination and chest x-rays and may be detected incidentally on CT scans performed for other indications (see **Image.** Rib Fracture).[1][28] In cases of moderate-to-severe pneumothorax, arterial blood gas analysis may reveal hypoxia and, in patients with underlying COPD, occasional hypercapnia.[29] Spontaneous pneumothorax should always be considered when diagnosing patients with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.[14] Similarly, traumatic pneumothorax must be suspected in any case of blunt or penetrating chest trauma. The diagnostic approach varies depending on the clinical scenario. An upright chest radiograph is typically the preferred initial imaging study. However, tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, as waiting for imaging can delay life-saving treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly used to evaluate pneumothorax. This modality offers greater accuracy compared to chest x-rays while avoiding radiation exposure.[30]\*\*\*\* Ultrasound is particularly valuable in critically ill patients and situations requiring rapid bedside assessment. **Classification Based on Size** The distinction between small and large pneumothoraces is based on the distance between the lung margin and the chest wall on imaging: [31] - Small pneumothorax: Visible rim less than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. - Large pneumothorax: Visible rim greater than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. Chest x-rays underestimate the size of pneumothorax and may also reveal other findings, such as hydropneumothorax (air and fluid levels in the pleural space), particularly when obtained in the upright position.[32] In cases where clinical suspicion remains high despite a
