cases.[23][24] Infections tend to occur in the summer and fall in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in Australia, they are most frequently observed in the fall.[25][26] Transmission occurs through human-to-human contact but is inefficient, leading to most outbreaks being contained at the household level.[27] Immunocompromised hosts are more at risk of infection and severe disease. However, the incubation period is long (approximately 3-4 weeks), symptoms are typically mild, and some patients may experience asymptomatic infection.[28] Despite individuals aged 5 to 15 having a high rate of infection, _C. pneumoniae_ infection is common in older individuals and can result in higher mortality rates compared to younger populations.[27][29] The prevalence of _C. pneumoniae_ infection increases with age, and seroprevalence indicating exposure is found in 50% of adults by 20 years of age, and >95% by 50 years of age.[30] _L. pneumophila_ , unlike _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ , is not transmitted person-to-person, and infection typically occurs through host-environmental interactions, particularly with stagnant freshwater and artificial water systems.[31] Contaminated drinking water, humidifiers, nebulizers, ventilation, and cooling systems have all been linked with cases of legionellosis.[32][33][34] The incubation period can range anywhere from 2 to 10 days.[35] Males are more affected than females, and older age groups, immunosuppression, and cigarette smoking all appear to be independently associated with legionellosis. _L. pneumophila_ has been recorded in 1% to 3% of all community-acquired pneumonia cases and contributes up to 26% of all atypical pneumonia, but it may also be asymptomatic in some cases.[36] In a larger population survey, _L. longbeachae_ was found in only 5% of 556 community-acquired pneumonia cases in Thailand.[37] Prevalence tends to be higher in younger age groups, and mortality is lower than for _L. pneumophila_ cases.[38] _L. longbeachae_ is typically associated with natural soil mixtures within hot and humid potting environments. Inoculation is thought to occur through inhaled exposure to contaminated potting mix and poor hygiene while gardening or landscaping.[39] Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Mycoplasma Pneumonia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27362)", "[Chlamydia Pneumonia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19432)," and "[Legionnaires Disease](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24176)" for further information. ## Pathophysiology Atypical bacteria that cause pneumonia are often obligate intracellular organisms, making them difficult to culture and identify on Gram stain.[1] _M. pneumoniae_ ,_C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species are typically gram-negative bacteria, but each has unique virulence factors and characteristics that allow them to survive in hostile environments, including against host defenses. These bacteria are acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets, and, except _Legionella_ species, are
