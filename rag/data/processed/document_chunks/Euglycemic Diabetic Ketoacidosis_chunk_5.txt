Consider increasing the amount of dextrose to 10% if ketoacidosis persists on D5%.[27][35][27] Potassium should also be carefully monitored as total body potassium levels are likely to be depleted, and IV supplementation of potassium and other electrolytes may be needed. Blood glucose levels should be checked hourly, and electrolytes should be checked every 4 hours at a minimum, as is the standard for treating DKA. Patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should have these medications discontinued as soon as the diagnosis is recognized and held until recovery from the acute illness.[10] Sodium bicarbonate infusions are not indicated and even use in severe acidemia of pH less than 6.9 is controversial. Patients generally require ICU admission for close hemodynamic and laboratory monitoring and frequent titration of insulin infusion.[2][36][37] Treatment with IV fluid resuscitation should continue until the anion gap closes and acidosis has resolved. ## Differential Diagnosis In patients presenting with anion gap metabolic acidosis, clinicians must consider a variety of possibilities early on. Infections, including pneumonia, genitourinary infection, and bacteremia, must be ruled out early in the diagnostic algorithm. In patients presenting with abdominal pain, consider intraabdominal infection and pancreatitis. Consider toxic alcohol (methanol, ethylene glycol) or paraldehyde ingestion, salicylate overdose, lactic acidosis, starvation ketosis, and pregnancy in the appropriate clinical setting. Patients may have also recently administered insulin, contributing to the euglycemic presentation. The presentation is very similar to alcoholic ketoacidosis, except EDKA patients have diabetes, and alcoholic ketoacidosis patients present after an alcohol binge more commonly have hypoglycemia and can be successfully resuscitated with crystalloid and dextrose without the requirement for insulin. ## Prognosis Most patients with EDKA recover well with prompt recognition and treatment. Delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, especially hydration without dextrose/insulin infusion, can lead to persistent acidosis, vomiting, and prolonged hospitalization. The prognosis is worse for small children and pregnant women. Rarely, severe cases of respiratory failure, hypovolemic shock, coma, and death. Death is rare in most EDKA cases; however, pregnant women are at greater mortality risk than the general population. ## Complications Euglycemic DKA can result in persistent vomiting, dehydration, hypoglycemia, hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, cerebral edema, coma, seizures, infection, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death.[38] Maternal EDKA can increase the rate of fetal (up to 9%) and maternal mortality.[39][40] ## Consultations Consider consultation with a critical care intensivist and endocrinologist for severe cases. Pregnant women suffering from EDKA benefit from involvement with obstetric and maternal-fetal medicine
