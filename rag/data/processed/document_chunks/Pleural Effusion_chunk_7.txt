surgery. Thoracentesis is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Current recommendations when performing a thoracentesis include the following: - Bedside ultrasound improves success rates and reduces the risk of pneumothorax during fluid aspiration.[18] - Ultrasound can detect pleural fluid sequestrations. - Always send fluid for biochemistry, culture, and cytology. - Use Light's criteria to distinguish exudate from transudate.[19] - Lymphocyte-predominant effusions are typically due to malignancy and tuberculosis.[20] - Check pH when aspirating pleural effusions. - Do not inject air or local anesthetic into the sample, which may alter the fluid's pH. - Malignant effusions can be detected on cytology (40% to 60%). Chest tube drainage with antibiotic treatment is warranted in complex parapneumonic effusions or empyema. Small-bore drains, ranging from 10- to 14-gauge, are as effective as larger drains and may be preferable due to their ease of placement and reduced patient discomfort. Intrapleural fibrinolytic and DNase administration can be utilized to enhance drainage. However, thoracoscopic decortication may be necessary when these measures fail.[21] Patients diagnosed with malignant effusion typically do not require frequent drainage procedures unless infection or severe symptoms arise. Individuals requiring frequent drainage may opt for pleurodesis or tunneled catheter placement. In any case, limiting fluid extraction to no more than 1500 mL per session is important to avoid the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of pleural effusion includes the following: **Transudative Effusions** : - Cardiovascular: Common causes include congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism. - Infradiaphragmatic: Conditions such as cirrhosis and peritoneal dialysis often result in transudative effusions. - Other: Additional causes include nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia, which may arise from malnutrition, and renal or liver failure. **Exudative Effusions** : - Infections (most common): - Bacterial: Includes sepsis and pneumonia. - Tuberculosis: Still a significant cause of exudative effusion in developing countries. - Viral: Often associated with respiratory, hepatic, and cardiac infections. - Fungal and parasitic: Less common but notable etiologies, especially in Africa and South America. - Neoplasm: - Primary lung cancer: A frequent cause of exudative effusions. - Metastatic disease: Most commonly from lung, breast, colon, and ovarian cancers. - Mesothelioma: An important differential to consider, especially in patients with a history of exposure to carcinogenic agents, such as asbestos. - Infradiaphragmatic: - Conditions such as pancreatitis, peritonitis, bilothorax due to biliopleural fistula or bile duct obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, intraabdominal abscess, and postendoscopic esophageal sclerotherapy are notable
