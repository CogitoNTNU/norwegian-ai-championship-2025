They are essential proteins that act on blood vessels causing them to widen or dilate.[1] These peptides are expressed predominantly by cardiomyocytes of the mixed secretory-contractile phenotype in atrial and ventricular walls. In addition to regulating blood pressure, NPs inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.[2] In patients with decompensated heart failure due to volume overload, a treatment-induced drop in wedge pressure is often accompanied by a rapid drop in NP levels. Measurement of NP levels might thus assist with hemodynamic assessment and subsequent treatment titration.[3] NPs can also be found in the kidneys and can cause this essential organ to excrete more water and salt.[4] The b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was initially identified in porcine brain tissue in 1988 and was previously referred to as the “brain natriuretic peptide.” Later, researchers determined that the primary site of its release is cardiac ventricular cells, particularly in response to ventricular distention.[5] Following this discovery, abundant literature emerged regarding utilizing BNP as a potential biomarker to measure the presence and severity of heart failure.[6] B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a member of a family of natriuretic peptides (NP) that include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type natriuretic peptide, D-type natriuretic peptide, and urodilatin.[7] Pro-BNP is a 108–amino acid precursor protein of BNP found in the ventricles and atria of the heart. Human ANP and BNP are encoded by genes located on chromosome 1.[8] In situations of volume overload and myocardial muscle stretching, proBNP is upregulated at the genomic level.[9] A small amount of BNP is found in the cytoplasmic granules of myocytes. Upon stimulation for production and release, proBNP is cleaved by corin to equimolar amounts of the biologically active BNP hormone and the biologically inactive amino-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), which is also released into circulation as the unprocessed precursor protein.[8] When the effects of this peptide are evaluated on vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and myocytes, this peptide did not appear to have any biological activity.[10] The C-type natriuretic peptide is synthesized primarily in the central nervous system. It is also found in
