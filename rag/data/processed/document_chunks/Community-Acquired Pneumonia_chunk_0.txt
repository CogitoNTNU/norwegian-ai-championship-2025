The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild cases managed as outpatients to severe conditions necessitating intensive care unit intervention. Throughout this activity, participants focus on the nuances of community-acquired pneumonia evaluation and treatment. Learners gain the knowledge and skills necessary for early diagnosis and timely determination of the appropriate level of careâ€”crucial factors in enhancing patient outcomes. A key emphasis of this course lies in understanding the pivotal role played by the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia. By engaging in interdisciplinary collaboration, learners gain insights into how different healthcare professionals contribute to a holistic approach to managing this condition. This collaborative model not only enhances patient care but also significantly improves the competence of individual team members. **Objectives:** - Identify the varied community-acquired pneumonia presentations to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis. - Differentiate between bacterial and viral etiologies of community-aquired pneumonia through a comprehensive assessment of patient history, physical examination findings, and relevant diagnostic tests. - Apply appropriate antibiotic stewardship principles in the management of community-acquired pneumonia, ensuring optimal antimicrobial selection, dosage, and duration to minimize resistance and adverse effects. - Collaborate with interprofessional healthcare team memebers, including respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and infection control specialists, to optimize the comprehensive care of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

As disease presentation varies from a mild illness that can be managed as an outpatient to a severe illness requiring treatment in the intensive care unit, diagnosing early and determining the appropriate level of care is important for improving outcomes.[1][2][3][4][5] ## Etiology Many pathogens cause community-acquired pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.[6] Common bacterial pathogens can be classified as: - Gram-positive agents such as _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , _Staphylococcus aureus_ , group A streptococci, and other streptococci - Gram-negative agents such as _Haemophilus influenzae_ , _Moraxella catarrhalis_ , and Enterobacteriaceae - Atypical agents such as _Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae,_ and
