there were 119,305 violations of OSHA noise standards related to occupational noise exposure in general industry.[23] More males than females are reported to have NIHL, with no significant age differences noted. Many individuals with occupational hearing loss also experience depression and sleep disorders.[24] Recreational firearm use in the United States is more prevalent than in any other country in the world. Many individuals may be unaware of the associated hazards, as nearly all firearms produce peak impulse noise levels exceeding 140 dB. According to the Aural Blast Injury/Acoustic Trauma and Hearing Loss guidelines, AAT contributes to veteran disability at an annual rate of 13% to 18% in the United States.[25] A retrospective study of French military personnel assessed the prevalence of long-term hearing loss in individuals exposed to AAT. Audiograms taken an average of 448 days after AAT indicated a long-term hearing loss prevalence exceeding 20%.[26] Another study examined hearing loss following a single episode of AAT, estimating a 1% incidence of hearing loss over a 20-year follow-up period.[27] ## Pathophysiology Prolonged exposure to loud noise can result in hearing loss, whether acute or chronic. Overstimulation of hair cells may cause mechanical damage to the cochlea, reduce blood flow due to the formation of vasoactive lipid products, and trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. Acoustic overstimulation leads to excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which interferes with the functioning of the cochlea. This disruption can cause swelling of the stria vascularis and depolymerization of actin filaments in the stereocilia, leading to a temporary threshold shift. If left untreated, this process may progress to apoptosis and necrosis of hair cells and the organ of Corti due to free radical release, ultimately resulting in permanent sensorineural hearing loss.[28][29] AAT induces cochlear inflammation.[30] The pathophysiology of AAT involves the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the inner ear. These substances can directly damage DNA and cell membranes while signaling the upregulation of genes associated with apoptotic cell death. Research indicates that these substances spread from the basal to the apical cochlea over a period of 7 to 10 days. Following AAT, studies on guinea pig cochleas revealed progressive hair cell loss, which correlated with the delayed formation of reactive species, stabilizing after 2 weeks.[31] The inner cochlear hair cells convert sound into nerve signals, while the outer hair cells amplify sound sensitivity. In cases of AAT, the outer hair cells are
