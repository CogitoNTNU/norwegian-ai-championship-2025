Healthcare Team Outcomes Patients with community-acquired pneumonia may present to the clinician or the emergency department. The medical staff should be aware of the signs and symptoms associated with pneumonia. Working together, the healthcare team will improve outcomes. Members can include primary care, emergency department personnel, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists. Most patients respond to outpatient antibiotic therapy for 5 to 7 days. Patients who are short of breath, febrile, and in respiratory distress need to be admitted. An infectious disease or pulmonology consult is recommended if the diagnosis is unclear. Some patients may present with a parapneumonic effusion, which may require drainage. Typically, nurses monitor the patients and report current status and updates to the rest of the team. Pharmacists evaluate medication choices, check for allergies and drug interactions, and educate patients about possible side effects and the importance of compliance. The providers should encourage all patients to get the annual influenza vaccine. In addition, all adults 65 and older and those considered at risk for pneumonia must receive the pneumococcal vaccination. The outcomes in most patients with community-acquired pneumonia are favorable.[19] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27357&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27357) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/infectious-disease/community-acquired-pneumonia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27357) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27357/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27357) [![Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess](/books/NBK430749/bin/Lung_abscess_-_CT_scan_x7471756882x.gif)](/books/NBK430749/figure/article-27357.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK430749/figure/article-27357.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess.
