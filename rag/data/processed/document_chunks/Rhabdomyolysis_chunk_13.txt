complications like infection. Consideration should be given to loop diuretics in patients with volume overload states. Appropriate use of hemodialysis can be used with anuric AKI, hyperkalemia, and volume overload after conservative measures fail. Peritoneal dialysis is not preferred in the setting of trauma. **Management of Nontraumatic Rhabdomyolysis** Rhabdomyolysis from nontraumatic causes is managed similarly to that secondary to trauma. Adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation with normal isotonic saline should be provided depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis. Management includes removing the offending agent at diagnosis, titration of IV fluids to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 mL/h, and serial daily monitoring of serum CPK levels to document trends. In patients with serum CPK levels less than 5000 U/L, aggressive fluid resuscitation is discouraged as these patients are less likely to develop AKI.[62] Forceful alkaline diuresis can be considered in severe cases where the CPK is more than 30,000 U/L without oliguria, anuria, or AKI. Mannitol is not commonly used in nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Loop diuretics can be considered in the setting of volume overload from aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patients who remain oliguric or anuric, even with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and develop AKI should be considered for hemodialysis. The role of dialysis in the removal of myoglobin has not been demonstrated.[41] **Management of Electrolytes Abnormalities in Rhabdomyolysis** Rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels less than 6 mEq/L without ECG changes should be managed with potassium binders and the use of bicarbonate in the fluids. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels 6 mEq/L or above with or without ECG changes should be treated with an ampule of D50 followed by 10 units of regular insulin and IV sodium bicarbonate. In general, calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is commonly used in the emergency room with hyperkalemia. However, rhabdomyolysis, especially from trauma, is associated with late occurrences of hypercalcemia, so calcium should be used with caution in the management of hyperkalemia due to rhabdomyolysis. Symptomatic hypocalcemia, such as tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias, should be treated with IV calcium gluconate. Excessive calcium replacement can precipitate hypercalcemia during the recovery phase. Hyperuricemia from rhabdomyolysis should be managed with allopurinol and only if the serum uric acid is more than 8 mg/dL. Patients with volume overload, severe acidosis, uremia, and refractory hyperkalemia need hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient to correct the excess amount of electrolyte changes and
