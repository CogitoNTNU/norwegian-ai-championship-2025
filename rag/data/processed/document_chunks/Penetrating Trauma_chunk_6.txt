studies on guinea pig cochleas revealed progressive hair cell loss, which correlated with the delayed formation of reactive species, stabilizing after 2 weeks.[31] The inner cochlear hair cells convert sound into nerve signals, while the outer hair cells amplify sound sensitivity. In cases of AAT, the outer hair cells are typically the first to be affected, leading to hearing loss ranging from 40 to 60 dB. Continued damage can further harm the inner hair cells, exacerbating hearing loss. Temporary threshold shifts correspond anatomically to decreased stiffness of the stereocilia in the outer hair cells.[32] The stereocilia become disarrayed and nonfunctional. In instances of severe noise exposure, complete hearing loss may occur if the entire organ of Corti is damaged. Hearing loss is often more pronounced at frequencies higher than 4 kHz.[33] Histopathologically, the primary damage site is the rootlets connecting the stereocilia to the top of the hair cell. Apoptosis of the sensory cells results in progressive Wallerian degeneration and, ultimately, loss of primary auditory nerve fibers. High-intensity noise can damage hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, as well as cause middle ear injuries, including tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular chain dislocation, and oval or round window rupture, which may lead to a perilymphatic fistula.[34] In addition to causing inner ear damage, AAT disrupts middle ear function by interfering with the muscles involved in hearing, specifically the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles. **Stapedius muscle:** This is the smallest skeletal muscle in the human body, measuring approximately 1 mm in length, that protects the cochlea by contracting in response to loud noises, which produces a dampening effect. **Tensor tympani muscle:** This muscle inserts between the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and the neck of the malleus. The tensor tympani muscle shares a tendon with the tensor veli palatini muscle and is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve.[35] AAT causes hypercontraction of the tensor tympani muscle, likely leading to muscle strain, fatigue, or overload.[36] Some authors have compared tensor tympani hypercontraction to a myofascial trigger point or a "micro-cramp."[37] Tensor tympani hypercontraction may be severe and could explain the fluttering sensation experienced in AAT.[38] Prolonged contraction, or muscle overload, can result in injury to the tensor tympani, with the following proposed consequences:[39] - Compression of blood vessels reduces oxygen supply. - Production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decreases. - The body shifts to anaerobic glycolysis, leading to lactic acid production and
