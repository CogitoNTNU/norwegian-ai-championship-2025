corticosteroids; and IV magnesium.[12] Upon verifying that the patient is using routine asthma medications, the anesthesia provider must determine whether to administer prophylactic therapy such as inhaled ß2-agonists or systemic corticosteroids (for example, methylprednisolone) before proceeding to the operating room. Preoperative systemic steroids have shown little benefit unless started 2 to 3 days in advance of surgery. A study revealed that administering systemic corticosteroids alongside inhaled ß2-agonists for 5 days before surgery markedly decreased the incidence of bronchospasm following intubation.[13] ## Clinical Significance Asthma is a common respiratory condition among patients undergoing surgery, and proper preoperative assessment, pharmacotherapy, and safe anesthesia measures are crucial for reducing complications. Perioperative respiratory adverse events can occur at any stage of anesthesia. However, the most critical times for perioperative respiratory complications occur during the induction of general anesthesia, airway manipulation, and emergence. Complications include bronchospasm, laryngospasm, desaturation, coughing, excessive secretion production, and pneumonia. Regional anesthesia can be a better option to avoid airway manipulation when appropriate. Involving expert team members is essential to patient safety. Having an experienced pediatric anesthesia provider manage the airway has been shown to reduce the risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events for children.[14] Patients with uncontrolled asthma have a higher risk of postoperative mortality and pneumonia. A preoperative assessment, including a detailed history, medication evaluation, and possibly pulmonary function tests, is essential when assessing patients with asthma before surgery. By optimizing medical management and using appropriate anesthetic techniques, healthcare professionals can minimize perioperative respiratory complications.[4] **Preoperative Medications** Other than theophylline, patients should continue their maintenance medications during the entire perioperative period, including the day of surgery. Patients with poorly controlled symptoms scheduled to undergo thoracic or upper abdominal surgery, open aortic aneurysm repair, neurosurgery, or head and neck surgeries generally receive a 5-day course of oral glucocorticoids and short-acting bronchodilators. In addition, short-acting bronchodilators are often administered shortly before anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The anesthesia team must carefully administer warm and humidified gases, achieve appropriate anesthesia depth, and monitor airway management during surgery. Patients with bronchorrhea can receive a combination of a nebulized anticholinergic agent and a moderate-acting ß2-agonist, such as ipratropium bromide-salbutamol. Postoperative care involves monitoring oxygen levels, providing adequate hydration and analgesia, and correctly prescribing the patient's usual asthma medications. For patients with well-controlled asthma, routine mechanical ventilation is generally suitable. However, when airflow obstruction is present, prolonged expiratory phases can pose challenges.
