to those administered a placebo (2.9%).[1][29] Animal studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of pituitary hyperplasia and adenomas with high calcitonin dosages. However, preclinical investigations involving the overexpression of salmon calcitonin in transgenic mice have not provided any indication of the molecule acting as a carcinogen.[30] Calcitonin has also demonstrated the absence of mutagenic properties when exposed to _Salmonella_ and _Escherichia_ _coli_ cells. Furthermore, based on the current comprehension of calcitonin's mechanisms of action, there is no plausible mechanism of causality.[31][32] Although the association between calcitonin usage and cancer remains tenuous, it is advisable to carefully contemplate treatment alternatives with more favorable risk-to-benefit profiles before initiating pharmacotherapy. Considering calcitonin's mechanisms of action, the drug may also induce hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can trigger symptoms such as tetany, seizures, changes in mental status, and even cardiac arrest. Patients should incorporate supplementary vitamin D and calcium into their regimen when utilizing calcitonin to manage Paget disease of bone or postmenopausal osteoporosis to avert the onset of hypocalcemia. Men between the ages of 50 and 70 should consider a daily calcium intake of 1000 mg, whereas women older than 50 and men older than 70 should take 1200 mg of calcium daily. Individuals aged 50 or older should take 800 to 1000 units of vitamin D daily, whereas those aged 70 or older should reduce their daily vitamin D intake to 800 units.[1] Combining calcitonin and bisphosphonates can offer therapeutic advantages in managing hypercalcemia. However, this approach necessitates caution, as it can potentially lead to hypocalcemia, especially when using zoledronate.[33] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes When initiating calcitonin therapy for patients with acute hypercalcemia, Paget disease of bone, and postmenopausal osteoporosis, a collaborative healthcare approach involving an interprofessional team is essential. This healthcare team should include the patient's primary care physician, endocrinologist, oncologist, advanced practice practitioners, nursing staff, and clinical pharmacist to provide a comprehensive approach toward patient care. Close monitoring of patients' conditions is crucial throughout calcitonin therapy to uphold the safety of patients and enhance their treatment outcomes. Interprofessional collaboration facilitates consistent monitoring of the patient's treatment response, encompassing evaluations of bone density, serum calcium levels, and the occurrence of adverse effects. Effective communication and coordination with shared decision-making among healthcare professionals enable timely modifications in dosage, treatment duration, or adjunctive therapies when necessary. This approach optimizes the medication's potential therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing adverse events. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple
