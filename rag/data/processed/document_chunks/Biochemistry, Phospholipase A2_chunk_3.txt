proper formation of bones, glucose-dependent insulin secretion, maturation of sperm, proper function of skeletal and smooth muscle, and neuroaxonal regeneration in response to injury. **Lysosomal PLA** Lysosomal PLA plays a significant role in the degradation of phospholipids within lysosomes. Most notably, its function and high levels of expression in alveolar macrophages allow for surfactant phospholipid degradation. This process prevents the accumulation of phospholipids within cells. Failure of proper enzymatic function leads to phospholipidosis with notable phenotypic features in knockout mice, including splenomegaly and increased foam cell formation. Lysosomal PLA also plays an important immunological role through the processing of lipid antigens and subsequent use by CD1 proteins for presentation to leukocytes. This role has been examined regarding pulmonary infection with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Results indicate that lysosomal PLA plays an essential role in the formation of adaptive Th1 T-cell immunity to _M. tuberculosis_. **Adipose-Specific PLA** Adipose-specific PLA is a tumor suppressor in the body. The function of the enzyme in adipocytes is important to the regulation of lipolysis and prostaglandin production. Increased enzymatic activity results in the formation of prostaglandin E, which causes decreased intracellular cAMP and increased adiposity. **Platelet-Activating Factor Aacetylhydrolase** Macrophages predominantly synthesize platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase in the body. Protein synthesis of the enzyme increases during the process of monocyte differentiation into macrophages. The enzyme is more catalytically active in LDL particles rather than HDL particles, suggesting that their role in interacting with HDL may include a reservoir function when more enzyme is needed to interact with LDL. The body of evidence surrounding the proper function of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase has changed considerably over time. Initially, the thinking was that it played a crucial role in the prevention of the development of atherosclerosis; however, recent evidence suggests that its function is atherogenic. Therefore, the enzyme is now considered to be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.[1][5][3][6] ## Pathophysiology **Secretory PLA** Secretory PLA plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many conditions that involve inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis, and tumor cell growth. The pathophysiology of ARDS and asthma involve two mechanisms related to normal respiratory physiology. Normal expression of secretory PLA results in increased leukotrienes, which serve as potent chemokines, resulting in leukocyte attraction and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines. This role has been established in the pathogenesis of asthma.
