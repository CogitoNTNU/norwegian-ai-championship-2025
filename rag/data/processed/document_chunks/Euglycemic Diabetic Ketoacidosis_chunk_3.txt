euglycemia, and ketoacidosis by the previous mechanisms described.[2] Alcoholic ketoacidosis may have a similar presentation to EDKA, with anorexia, vomiting, dyspnea, and significant anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonemia. Some consider alcoholic ketoacidosis a subtype of EDKA, and both are associated with increased glucagon/insulin ratio.[1][9][15] The differentiating factors are that alcoholic ketoacidosis patients do not have diabetes or use diabetic medications and are more commonly present with hypoglycemia or after a severe alcohol binge.[26] Similarly, excessive alcohol consumption in a person with diabetes can destroy pancreatic beta cells, decrease gluconeogenesis, and decrease glycogen stores. Coupled with vomiting and carbohydrate starvation, it results in accelerated lipolysis, ketoacidosis, and EDKA.[2][9] ## History and Physical Signs and symptoms vary on a case-by-case basis but are similar in presentation to hyperglycemic DKA, although perhaps without polyuria, polydipsia, or severe mental status changes. EDKA patients can present with nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, generalized malaise, lethargy, loss of appetite, fatigue, or abdominal pain. Patients may not have polydipsia or polyuria since serum glucose is normal. The onset can be more insidious compared to hyperglycemic DKA due to the mechanism of subacute starvation required to induce ketosis and dehydration. There may or may not be an inciting infection or stressors, such as pregnancy, surgery, pancreatitis, alcohol use, or fasting.[30] Patients may present with deep, rapid breathing, known as Kussmaul respiration, which represents respiratory compensation for severe metabolic acidosis. They may have a fruity odor to their breath due to the loss of acetone. Tachycardia, hypotension, altered mentation, increased skin turgor, and delayed capillary refill are all signs of total body fluid loss. In severe cases, severe dehydration and metabolic derangement can lead to hypovolemic shock, lethargy, respiratory failure, coma, and death. ## Evaluation An ill-feeling patient with diabetes with symptoms such as malaise, dyspnea, nausea, or vomiting should undergo screening with serum pH and blood or urine ketone testing.[3][31][32][33] The initial laboratory evaluation of EDKA includes basic electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, creatinine, BUN, serum and urine ketones, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, arterial or venous blood gas analysis, lactic acid, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram. Urine screening for ketones with nitroprusside reagent does not measure beta-hydroxybutyrate but detects acetone and acetoacetate. Serum levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate are typically greater than 3 mmol/L in EDKA (normal values less than 0.5 mmol/L). Consider CBC with differential white blood cell count and blood cultures if an infection is on the differential. Serum osmolality, to
