and the extent of myocardial damage, which can be either focal or diffuse. Necrosis involving the coronary vessels may also be observed. In chronic cases, fibrosis may become evident. EMB is not routinely performed in nonfatal cases. Patients with myocarditis may or may not show evidence of viral genomes through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). - The Dallas criteria (1987) were the most widely adopted histopathological standards by pathologists for diagnosing myocarditis.[18] These criteria define "active myocarditis" as histological evidence of myocyte damage in a pattern that is not consistent with ischemic injury. This is characterized by mononuclear infiltrates, and in some cases, neutrophilic or eosinophilic infiltrates may also be present. If the mononuclear infiltrates are sparse, the condition is classified as "borderline myocarditis." The absence of these changes is classified as "no myocarditis." The Dallas criteria have a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 80%. In subsequent biopsies, the criteria further classify myocarditis as "persistent, healing, or healed," with or without the presence of fibrosis. - The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses a combination of histopathology and immunohistology for classifying myocarditis. According to the WHO Marburg criteria, acute (active) myocarditis is characterized by more than 14 leukocytes per square millimeter, along with evidence of degeneration or necrosis. Chronic myocarditis also shows more than 14 leukocytes per square millimeter; however, necrosis or degeneration is typically absent. A leukocyte count of fewer than 14 per square millimeter suggests no myocarditis.[6] **Nuclear perfusion imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan** - Acute myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, with activated immune cells exhibiting increased glucose metabolism. This heightened metabolic activity results in increased FDG uptake on PET imaging, which can be used to assess the extent and severity of myocardial inflammation. The typical findings on FDG-PET include patchy, diffuse, or focal uptake patterns that generally do not align with coronary artery territories. These areas of FDG uptake often correlate with T2-weighted hyperintensity and LGE observed on cardiac MRI. - Adequate patient preparation for FDG-PET imaging includes following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet for 12 to 24 hours before the scan to suppress normal myocardial glucose uptake. Additionally, a 12-hour fasting period is recommended before the FDG injection. In some cases, a heparin injection may be administered to further enhance myocardial fatty acid metabolism and improve image specificity. **Coronary angiography** This technique is considered the gold standard for ruling out CAD, particularly when the
