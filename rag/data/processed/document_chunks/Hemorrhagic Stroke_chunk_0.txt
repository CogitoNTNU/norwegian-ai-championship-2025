Hemorrhagic stroke may be further subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Hemorrhagic stroke is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality. Progression of hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential given the usual rapid expansion of hemorrhage, causing sudden deterioration of consciousness and neurological dysfunction. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. **Objectives:** - Summarize the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. - Identify the most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke and the most common site of the bleeding. - Review the common presentations of this hemorrhagic stroke. - CT scan is the initial investigation of choice. Prompt medical, sometimes surgical (in indicated cases), management is needed for recovery from hemorrhagic stroke.

Stroke can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is due to the loss of blood supply to an area of the brain. It is a common type of stroke. **Hemorrhagic stroke** is due to bleeding into the brain by the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke may be further subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). ICH is bleeding into the brain parenchyma, and SAH is bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Hemorrhagic stroke is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality.[1] Progression of hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential given the usual rapid expansion of hemorrhage, causing sudden deterioration of consciousness and neurological dysfunction. ## Etiology **Hypertension** is the most common cause of hemorrhagic stroke.[2] - Longstanding hypertension produces degeneration of media, breakage of the elastic lamina, and fragmentation of smooth muscles of arteries. - Lipohyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis of the subendothelium, microaneurysms, and focal dilatations are seen in the arterioles. The microaneurysms are named as Charcot-Bouchard
