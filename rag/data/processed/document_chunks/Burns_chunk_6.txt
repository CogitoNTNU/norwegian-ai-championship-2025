paralytic agents, may further obstruct the airway creating much more difficult intubating conditions.[1][3] **Intravascular Access** Individuals who have suffered severe burns may face challenges when receiving intravenous treatment due to the damage caused to common access areas such as the neck, limbs, and groin. Additionally, edema resulting from the burn shock phase or fluid creep from the overcompensation of fluid infusion to address intravascular loss can further complicate the process. Delay of fluid resuscitation for more than 2 hours after the initial injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, making vascular access an essential and critical component of burn management. When intravascular access proves too difficult via conventional means, peripheral intravenous or central venous access, intraosseous access can be overly beneficial. Intraosseous access is typically faster than peripheral intravenous and central venous line placement, with a much higher chance of first-time attempt success. The caveat of intraosseous access is that it is more likely to cause insertion and infusion pain than conventional methods. Despite its faster and easier placement, it is still not as common an access tool as one would surmise. To prevent intraosseous access failure, it is crucial to familiarize the device beforehand, as improper placement is the most common cause of failure. The proximal tibia is the most common location for placing an intraosseous needle, but the proximal humerus is equally effective. The proximal tibia is advantageous as it does not interfere with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.[2][9][10] **Thermoregulation** Patients suffering from severe burns lose their principal barrier to preventing heat loss. Thus, hypothermia becomes a primary anesthetic consideration. Evaporative heat and water loss from burn wounds create a direct means of heat loss. The cerebral mechanisms that combat hypothermia become dysregulated in severe burns. The critical temperature is the temperature at which a physiologic response to hypothermia occurs to produce heat-generating and conserving activity, ie, shivering, teeth chattering, vasoconstriction, cellular non-shivering thermogenesis. With severe burns, the critical temperature is decreased. When the innate mechanisms of combating hypothermia are combined with a general anesthetic, patients are significantly predisposed to hypothermia. General anesthesia is associated with both redistribution of heat from the core to the periphery and inhibiting the central thermoregulatory control making even healthy patients prone to hypothermia from the subsequent vasodilation. The critical means to ensure optimal thermoregulation for all burn patients include forced-air warming, fluid warming, and raising the operating room temperature. An accurate means of
