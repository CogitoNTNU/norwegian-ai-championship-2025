use in acute treatment and decision making of viral pneumonia. _**Chest x-ray**_ - As there is a tremendous overlap in findings on chest x-ray with both bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia, no one finding or set of findings is pathognomonic. Features that are suggestive of bacterial pneumonia include the following: - Alveolar infiltrates - Lobar consolidation - Nodular densities - Pleural effusion Features that are more suggestive of viral pneumonia include the following: - Interstitial infiltrates - Patchy distribution of interstitial infiltrates - Bilateral infiltrates - Pneumonia-like syndrome with an unremarkable chest x-ray \_**Chest CT scan** _ - The advent of thin-section CT scan has revolutionized the radiographic diagnosis of viral pneumonia. It has been observed, particularly in cases of viral pneumonia-like clinical presentation and normal chest radiography, thin-section CT scan will be positive for parenchymal defects and aid in diagnosis. ## Treatment / Management The cornerstone of treatment of viral pneumonia consists of the following: **Supportive Care** - The first priority of supportive care is to maintain oxygenation as needed. This may entail nasal cannula, noninvasive airway, or mechanical ventilation. - The second priority of supportive care is to maintain hydration either via supervised oral intake or intravenous fluids. - The third priority of supportive care is to maintain rest and decrease oxygen demand. - A final priority of supportive care is to meet the increased calorie needs of the patient, secondary to the increased respiratory effort. **Management of Comorbid Illnesses** **Appropriate treatment of Coexisting Bacterial Types of Pneumonia** Most current evidence indicates the frequent existence of concomitant bacterial types of pneumonia. The prototypical example is the observation that the majority of mortality during the 1917-1918 influenza pandemic was secondary to bacterial pneumonia, superimposed on the initial influenza pneumonia.[13][14][15] Specific antiviral therapy for a number of viral pneumonia exists as does preventative or prophylactic therapies for those at high risk would have been exposed: \_**Influenza virus** \_ - Treatment: Oseltamivir or peramivir or zanamivir - Prophylaxis: Influenza vaccine and/or chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir \_**Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)** \_ - Treatment: Ribavirin - Prophylaxis: RSV immunoglobulin and/or palivizumab \_**Parainfluenza virus** \_ - Treatment: Ribavirin - Prophylaxis: Not available \_**Herpes simplex virus (HSV)** \_ - Treatment: Acyclovir - Prophylaxis: Not available \_**Adenovirus** \_ - Treatment: Ribavirin - Prophylaxis: Not available \_**Measles virus** \_ - Treatment: Ribavirin - Prophylaxis: intravenous immunoglobulin \_**Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** \_ - Treatment: Ganciclovir or foscarnet - Prophylaxis:
