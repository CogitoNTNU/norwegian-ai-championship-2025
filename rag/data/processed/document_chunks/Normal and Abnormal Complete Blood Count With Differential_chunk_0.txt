Most analyzers now also automatically generate a leucocyte differential. This reference describes each component of the CBC and discusses the interpretation of results. Though commonly utilized reference intervals are provided, all are lab-specific in practice. The local laboratory guidelines apply when interpreting a CBC. ## Issues of Concern **Red Cell Tests** **Hemoglobin** Hemoglobin (Hb) measures the amount of hemoglobin in whole blood and is expressed in grams per deciliter (g/dL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), normal references for hemoglobin levels are 13 to 18 g/dL in adult men and 12 to 16 g/dL in adult women who are not pregnant. In pregnancy, the lower limit is usually decreased to 10 g/dL to accommodate physiological plasma expansion. A low Hb is called anemia, while erythrocytosis is defined as a high Hb. Hb is also used to grade the severity of anemia (see **Table.** 1)[2][3] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table0/?report=objectonly) Table. 1. Grading of Anemia Severity . Hb measurement using an automated analyzer can be affected by factors such as plasma volume. For example, patients with hypervolemia may exhibit a Hb lower than their true level, while severely dehydrated patients may have a spuriously elevated Hb. Similarly, interferents within the specimen, such as lipemia, hyperbilirubinemia, paraproteinemia, or hyperleukocytosis, may spuriously elevate the Hb. The etiology of anemia is expansive and may be due to blood loss, blood cell destruction, deficient production, or defective production.[4][5][6] Erythrocytosis may be due to hemoconcentration or dehydration or from increased production of red cells, which may be due to a primary myeloproliferative pathology or secondary to cyanotic heart disease, respiratory disease, high altitudes, renal pathology, smoking, or erythropoietin-secreting tumors.[7] **Hematocrit** Hematocrit (Hct) is the percentage volume of red blood cells (RBC) in the blood calculated with RBC and mean corpuscular volume
