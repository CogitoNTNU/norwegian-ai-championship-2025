most symptoms (>70%) resolve within three days to two weeks, with the rest improving within four weeks.[57][58] Although adolescent females have a higher incidence rate and risk of injury from sport-related concussions, adolescent females and males usually recover at the same rate following TBI. It has been noted in some reports that females report more neurobehavioral and somatic symptoms, and males report more cognitive symptoms like confusion and amnesia.[57][59][60] The assessment of adolescents and those playing sports following a concussion should follow a physician-directed return-to-play progression prior to returning to sport. These guidelines and recommendations can be found through various consensus statements like that of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM).[61] Following the completion of the six return-to-sport (RTS) strategy steps, with each step taking about 24 hours to complete, the medical determination to return to sport or at-risk activity can be concluded. ## Complications - Brain death - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (especially in military personnel and athletes related to contact sports) [62] - CNS infection [63] - CSF leaks [64] - Dementia [65] - Deep vein thrombosis - Depression and PTSD [66] - Dyselectrolytemia (eg, cerebral salt wasting and SIADH) [67][68][67] - Endocrinopathies such as hypopituitarism [69] - Hydrocephalus - Malignant cerebral edema - Neurogenic pulmonary edema [70] - Neurovascular injuries - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity [71] - Pneumocephalus [72] - Seizures - Spasticity [73] - Stunned myocardium syndrome [74] - Substance use disorder - Vasospasm [75] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Prevention is critical, as most cases of traumatic brain injury are due to accidents from preventable trauma. Motor vehicle collisions, the most common cause of TBI, are not always preventable. However, some measures can be taken to decrease risk, including wearing a seatbelt, not driving while distracted or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and using appropriate booster seats for children based on age. Bicyclists and motorcyclists should be encouraged to wear helmets. There is active research on recurrent traumatic brain injuries in sports. In a patient who has already experienced brain trauma, it is important to not return to activities until they have improved. Recurrent brain trauma may put patients at risk of lifelong symptoms, and there may be cumulative and permanent effects. In patients who have already experienced an injury, posttrauma recovery is a challenging process of physical, mental, and emotional recovery. Neurologic and psychiatric complications are common.
