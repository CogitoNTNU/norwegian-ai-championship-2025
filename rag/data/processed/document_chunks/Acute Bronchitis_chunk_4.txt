of cough accompanied by an inspiratory whoop or posttussive emesis should raise concerns for pertussis infection. In the early stages of infection, the symptoms of mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can often overlap, creating a challenge in distinguishing between both based solely on symptoms. Both conditions may present with common respiratory symptoms such as: - Cough: Initially, the cough may start as dry and irritating, but as acute bronchitis advances, it can transition to producing sputum. In acute bronchitis, this cough tends to persist for longer, often extending beyond 5 days. Approximately 50% of patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum.[21] Prolonged or forceful coughing may lead to chest wall or substernal musculoskeletal pain, usually self-limiting. - Mild fever: A low-grade fever may be present in both conditions, although it is more frequently associated with upper respiratory infections. The presence of high-grade fevers in the setting of acute bronchitis is unusual and warrants further diagnostic evaluation. - Fatigue and body aches: Mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can cause fatigue and general bodily discomfort. The differentiation between these 2 conditions becomes more apparent as the infection develops. If the symptoms predominantly affect the upper respiratory tract and resolve within a few days, it is more likely to be a mild upper respiratory infection. Conversely, if the symptoms persist for a week or longer and are accompanied by lower respiratory tract symptoms, this presentation indicates acute bronchitis. During a physical examination, lung auscultation may reveal the presence of wheezing. In some instances, the detection of rhonchi may improve or clear with coughing, suggesting that the airway secretions or obstruction causing the sound can be alleviated through coughing efforts. Pneumonia should be considered a potential diagnosis when detecting rales or egophony. Mild tachycardia may accompany these findings, indicating fever and dehydration secondary to the viral illness. It is important to note that similar signs of tachycardia can also be observed in bacterial infections. In general, the evaluation of the rest of the body systems typically falls within normal limits. ## Evaluation Acute bronchitis is typically diagnosed clinically, relying on a comprehensive assessment encompassing a medical history, pulmonary examination, and other pertinent physical findings. The evaluation of oxygen saturation, along with the assessment of pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate, serves as a pivotal indicator for gauging the severity of the condition. In cases where vital signs
