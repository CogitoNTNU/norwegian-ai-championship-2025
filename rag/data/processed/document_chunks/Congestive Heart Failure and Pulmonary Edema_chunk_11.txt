**Diabetes:** This condition\*\*\*\* is directly associated with the development of heart failure, independent of other associated clinical conditions. - **Alcohol:** Heavy alcohol use is associated with heart failure. - **Metabolic syndromes:** Following treatments based on evidence-based guidelines to decrease the risk of heart failure (ie, lipid disorders) is vital. - **Patient education:** Education regarding dietary salt restriction and fluid restriction is imperative.[1] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Treating heart failure and acute decompensated heart failure is challenging despite the use of maximal evidence-based therapy based on the stage of heart failure. Given the limited effect of current treatment strategies on the progression of heart failure, it is important to identify ways to maximize patient outcomes and quality of care by the interprofessional team. Patients at potential risk for heart failure based on comorbidities or other identified risk factors should receive appropriate evidence-based preventative counseling and treatments. When applicable, the primary care clinician who may be the most involved in managing the patient's risk factors should consult other specialists, including cardiologists, endocrinologists, pharmacists, cardiology nurses, and nutritionists, to ensure they provide the best advice and treatment for their patients. Nurses monitor patients, provide education, and collaborate with clinicians and the healthcare team to improve outcomes. Pharmacists review medications, inform patients and their families about potential adverse events, and monitor compliance. Given the propensity of patients with heart failure to require recurrent admissions, often because of non heart failure-related conditions, the collaboration between inpatient and outpatient services can be of benefit in the continuity of care and help promote improved outcomes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19880&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19880) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/congestive-heart-failure-and-pulmonary-edema-chf/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19880) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19880/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19880) [![Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph](/books/NBK554557/bin/cHF.gif)](/books/NBK554557/figure/article-19880.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK554557/figure/article-19880.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph.
