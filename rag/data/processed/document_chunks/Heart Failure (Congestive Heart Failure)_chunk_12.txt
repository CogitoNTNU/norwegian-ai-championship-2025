(see **Image**. Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph). In florid HF, Kerley B lines may be seen on chest radiographs. The absence of these findings in patients with a suggestive clinical presentation does not rule out CHF.[37] **Echocardiography** Echocardiography\*\*\*\* is the initial modality of choice in patients with suspected HF and is a readily available bedside tool. It quantifies right and left ventricular function, denotes structural abnormalities in cardiac chambers and valves, and helps visualize focal wall motion abnormalities. However, in patients with severe obesity, pregnancy, or mechanical ventilation, it may be challenging to obtain adequate acoustic windows. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an alternative for these patients. To obtain adequate echocardiographic images, adequate rate control is necessary in patients with tachyarrhythmias.[37] In patients with severe LV dysfunction, M-mode echocardiography may show increased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), decreased fractional shortening, increased E-point septal separation, or B-bump or notching of the mitral valve. **Cardiac catheterization** Cardiac catheterization\*\*\*\* is often required for diagnosing ischemic cardiomyopathy and can be helpful in accurately evaluating intracardiac pressures, eg, left ventricular end-diastolic or pulmonary artery pressures. **Computed tomography** Computed tomography (CT) may be used for the assessment of coronary artery disease in a young patient with ventricular dysfunction (older patients are likely to have baseline calcifications). CT may also be used in patients with congenital heart diseases causing HF. Cardiac CT may help detect tumors causing HF. CT may also be used to evaluate stent patency and graft. **Myocardial perfusion imaging** SPECT-myocardial perfusion imaging\*\*\*\* helps define the presence of ischemia in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular dysfunction and not undergoing coronary angiography. This study is particularly useful for assessing CAD in patients with no history of ischemia but elevated troponin. ECG-gated myocardial perfusion imaging evaluates LVEF, regional wall motion, and regional wall thickening. EF measurement with this study may be affected in patients with an irregular heart rate, low count density, and extracardiac radiotracer uptake. ECG-gated images are also valuable for recognizing artifactual defects seen on SPECT imaging, eg, breast tissue and diaphragmatic attenuation.[42] **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging** Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\*\*\*\* has evolved as an essential tool when a discrepancy exists between the clinical stage of the disease and echocardiographic findings. It helps with the precise evaluation of volume, chamber sizes, and ventricular function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also assesses the stage of valvular heart disease in detail.
