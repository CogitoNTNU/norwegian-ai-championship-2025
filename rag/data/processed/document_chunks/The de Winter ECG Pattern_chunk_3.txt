hypotension (ie, a systolic blood pressure \<90 mm Hg) and signs of low cardiac output (eg, oliguria, cyanosis, or impaired mental status) ## Evaluation The de Winter ECG pattern, as proposed in the seminal article by De Winter et al, consists of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall and peaked positive T waves.[8] Additionally, most individuals present with a 1 to 2 mm ST-segment elevation in lead aVR.[8] Other possible findings include loss of R wave progression in the precordial leads and QRS complexes of normal duration or only slightly widened.[8] (see **Image.** The de Winter ECG pattern) However, strict criteria defining the de Winter ECG pattern remain elusive, as elegantly reported in a systematic review by Morris et al which showed differences in categorization among studies.[9][10] In this review, upsloping depression of the ST-segment focusing on lead V3 and associated with upright T waves were consistently reported, whereas most individuals also had poor progression of the R wave as well as ST-segment elevation in lead aVR.[9] Interestingly, although initially described as comprising a static pattern, which was also noted in other studies, there are reports describing a potential temporal evolution as the ischemic event unfolds.[9][8][21][15][19] Cardiac biomarkers, specifically high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), should be assessed, though as stressed in contemporary guidelines, this should not delay the reperfusion strategy.[2][5][4] This pattern is associated with a hyperacute presentation, and therefore, clinicians should be aware that hs-cTn may be within the normal range or only mildly elevated initially.[16][22] Given the differential diagnosis, serum potassium levels may be considered, though this should not delay the reperfusion strategy.[8][16][23] ## Treatment / Management In patients with ACS risk factors or clinical features, the presence of the de Winter ECG pattern should lead to a high degree of suspicion for LAD artery occlusion.[5][10][19] Emergent consultation with a cardiologist should be undertaken, thus allowing early referral for cardiac catheterization and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if appropriate to ensure appropriate reperfusion as per STEMI guidelines.[2][3][8][10][19][4] Additionally, optimized medication, including aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation, should be implemented as the interventional cardiologist recommends.[2][3][4][24] After adequate reperfusion, patients should be admitted to a monitored coronary care or intensive cardiac care unit, with subsequent management and ancillary testing recommended by current guidelines.[2][3][5][4] ## Differential Diagnosis Though most cases of this pattern are associated with
