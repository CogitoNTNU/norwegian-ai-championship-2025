statin therapy, such as atorvastatin 80 mg. **Adjunctive therapy:** Adjunctive therapy plays a crucial role in managing AMI. These include: - **P2Y12 inhibitors** : medications such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, are antiplatelet agents that help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. These are typically initiated with aspirin and continued for a specific time, depending on the patient's clinical presentation and chosen agent. - **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ ARB)** : these medications help reduce afterload, promote vasodilation, and inhibit the adverse remodeling of the heart following MI. ACE inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, to other high-risk features - **Spironolactone** : a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist, has reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) includes the following conditions: - Aortic dissection - Unstable angina - Stable angina - Vasospastic angina - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Myocardial trauma - Massive pulmonary embolism - Tension pneumothorax - Esophageal perforation - Esophageal spasm - Gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic acid disease - Musculoskeletal pain - Acute pericarditis - Myocarditis - Pulmonary embolism ## Staging Killip classification is a widely used system for assessing the 30-day prognosis in patients with STEMI. It helps categorize the severity of heart failure and determines the risk of adverse outcomes. The Killip classification is as follows: - **Killip class I:** This class indicates no evidence of heart failure. - **Killip class II:** This class represents mild signs of heart failure, such as bibasal rales, a third heart sound (S3), and raised JVP. However, despite these findings, the patient's clinical condition is stable. - **Killip class III:** This class denotes the presence of acute pulmonary edema. Patients in this category experience significant respiratory distress due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. - **Killip class IV:** This class represents cardiogenic shock, the most severe form of heart failure. Patients in this category exhibit profound hemodynamic instability, characterized by severe hypotension, reduced cardiac output, and end-organ hypoperfusion. In addition, they may have cold and clammy skin, altered mental status, and signs of peripheral vasoconstriction. ## Prognosis The in-hospital mortality rates associated with each classification are as follows:[27] - Killip class I: 6% - Killip class II: 17% - Killip class III: 38% - Killip class IV: 81% The anatomical location
