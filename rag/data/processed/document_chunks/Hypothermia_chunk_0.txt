While hypothermia's usual causes are excessive cold stress and inadequate thermogenesis, external factors can increase the risk of developing hypothermia. The condition is potentially fatal if not promptly treated. Familiarity with its myriad presentations and management strategies is crucial to medical practice. This activity for healthcare professionals enhances the learner's competence in evaluating and treating patients with hypothermia. This activity equips clinicians to contribute meaningfully to the multidisciplinary care of patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify possible hypothermia causes and describe the bodily changes associated with this condition. - Describe the common presentations of a patient with accidental hypothermia. - Determine the appropriate management approach for patients presenting with hypothermia. - Develop effective collaboration and communication strategies within the interprofessional team to enhance outcomes for patients presenting with hypothermia.

The condition is common in cold geographic areas and during cooler months, though it can also develop in locations with milder climates.[1] Hypothermia affects all organ systems. Presenting symptoms depend on the severity of the condition. The hypothalamus regulates body temperature through autonomic mechanisms. This region of the brain receives input from central and peripheral thermal receptors. Muscle tone and basal metabolic rate (BMR) increase initially in response to cold stress. Heat production can double through these mechanisms. Shivering also enhances heat production, increasing metabolism 2 to 5 times the baseline BMR.[2] Newborns lack the shivering mechanism due to incomplete development of the nervous system. However, brown fat helps generate heat in newborns' bodies. Brown fat's thermogenin increases mitochondrial membrane permeability and disrupts the electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes. ETC disruption and subsequent hydrogen ion leakage block ATP production and generate body heat. Thyroid, catecholamine, and adrenal hormones also increase in response to cold stress. Cold-induced, sympathetically mediated peripheral vasoconstriction reduces heat loss. Behavioral changes like adding more clothing, seeking shelter, starting a fire, and exercising help retain or produce body heat. Patients with
