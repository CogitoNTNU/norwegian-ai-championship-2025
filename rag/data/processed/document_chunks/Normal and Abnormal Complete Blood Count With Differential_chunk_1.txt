of red cells, which may be due to a primary myeloproliferative pathology or secondary to cyanotic heart disease, respiratory disease, high altitudes, renal pathology, smoking, or erythropoietin-secreting tumors.[7] **Hematocrit** Hematocrit (Hct) is the percentage volume of red blood cells (RBC) in the blood calculated with RBC and mean corpuscular volume (MCV): Hct = RBC x MCV/10. The normal reference interval is usually 40% to 54% in adult men and 36% to 48% in adult women. Similarly to Hb, Hct is reduced in anemia, increased in erythrocytosis, and is influenced by changes in plasma volume.[8] **Red blood cell count** RBC is the amount of red cells present per unit volume of blood and is expressed in cells per microliter (cells/μL). The normal reference interval is usually 4.6 to 6.2 million cells/μL in adult men and 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/μL in adult women. Unlike Hb, RBC does not accurately measure the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity and is not directly used to diagnose anemia. However, red cell indices are important in evaluating anemia. The RBC may be spuriously low in the setting of red cell agglutination or a sample diluted with intravenous fluid infusion.[4] **Red Cell Indices** The red cell indices are calculated parameters provided within the CBC and include red cell distribution width (RCDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).\*\*\*\* They are calculated using the measured Hb, Hct, and RBC and help elucidate the etiology of anemia. MCH and MCHC are also often used for quality control within laboratories.[9] **Red cell distribution width** Red cell distribution width (RCDW) quantitatively assesses the degree of variation in red cell size, known as anisocytosis. The value is calculated as the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation of the MCV distribution curve. RCDW is expressed as a percentage, where a higher value indicates a greater variation in red cell size. The normal reference interval in adults is approximately 11.5% to 15% but varies between laboratories. RDW is useful in assessing anemia to help further delineate etiology (see **Table.** 2). **Mean corpuscular volume** Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) defines the average volume of the red blood cells present and is expressed in femtoliter (fL) or cubic micrometers (µm3). The value is calculated by dividing Hct by RBC. The normal reference interval in adults is 80 to 100 µm3. MCV is commonly used to classify anemias as microcytic (low MCV),
