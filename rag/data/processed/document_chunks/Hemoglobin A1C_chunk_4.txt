hemoglobin has been firmly recognized as a predictor of the risk of developing microvascular complications, such as retinopathy and nephropathy, in patients with diabetes mellitus.[32][33] Notably, the absolute risks of these complications are directly proportional to the mean HbA1c concentration. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of diabetic retinopathy increases continuously with rising HbA1c levels, and a single HbA1c measurement can predict the progression of retinopathy even 4 years later.[2][34] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety The laboratory must develop, document, implement, and maintain a comprehensive quality management system to ensure all processes adhere to established quality standards and consistently deliver reliable results.[35] For HbA1c testing, both internal and external quality control are vital elements of this system, directly contributing to the accuracy and consistency of reported outcomes.[36] Internal quality control focuses on monitoring the analytical phase of the testing process. According to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments guidelines, a minimum of 2 quality control levels must be performed every 24 hours for routine laboratory assays. Although manufacturers provide control ranges, laboratories are encouraged to define them based on internal data and relevant guidelines to optimize performance.[37] Quality control results should be charted using Levey-Jennings plots, with appropriate Westgard rules applied. If any control rule is violated, patient testing must be halted immediately, appropriate corrective actions implemented, and testing resumed only after control results return to acceptable limits.[38] External quality assessment, or proficiency testing, offers an objective evaluation of laboratory performance. Participating laboratories receive blinded samples from an external organization, submit their results, and have them statistically analyzed and compared against peer groups. For HbA1c, the College of American Pathologists provides an accuracy-based external quality assurance program that promotes interlaboratory consistency and helps identify areas needing improvement.[39][36][40] Given that HbA1c exhibits low within-subject biological variation, typically \<2%, the ADA recommends that intralaboratory imprecision maintain a coefficient of variation (CV) below 2%, and interlaboratory CV should not exceed 3.5%.[41] Meeting these precision standards guarantees the reliability and clinical significance of test results. Laboratory safety is equally critical to overall testing quality. All personnel must follow infection prevention protocols, including proper use of personal protective equipment and safe handling of biological specimens. Maintaining a safe and compliant laboratory environment helps ensure consistent performance while minimizing risks of errors or exposure.[42] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes All clinicians caring for patients with diabetes mellitus need a thorough understanding of HbA1c and its clinical significance.
