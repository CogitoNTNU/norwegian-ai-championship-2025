with an LVEF of less than 55% to 60% and those with elevated BNP.[78] A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan, as compared with valsartan, has a tendency to lower the risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations overall, but more so in women with HFpEF than men; the average LVEF in study participants was 57%.[79] **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy** The effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy on cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF has been demonstrated in the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) and Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-PRESERVED) trials.[80] The DELIVER trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin decreased the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with HFpEF.[81] The EMPEROR-PRESERVED trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalizations, decline in kidney function, and improved quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[82] The effects of SGLTi therapy are consistent for patients with HFpEF across all age groups, and increasing age has not been associated with an increase in adverse events.[16][83] SGLT2i therapy should be considered in all patients with HFpEF, with or without underlying type 2 diabetes, as early as index hospitalization after initial medical stabilization.[81] In patients with HFpEF, obesity, and underlying type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonists are beneficial if dual therapy is required.[12] **Rate control in atrial fibrillation** Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred therapies for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFpEF. Digoxin may be considered in hypotensive patients. Atrial fibrillation in patients with HFpEF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, or a mechanical mitral valve requires anticoagulation regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score. The 2023 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation recommends catheter ablation as a first-line therapy to improve symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in younger patients with fewer comorbidities.[84] **Additional therapies** In patients with HFpEF and suspected sleep apnea, consultation with sleep medicine for possible polysomnography is recommended. Fatigue is a common symptom of heart failure, and daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of sleep apnea; obesity is a risk factor for both disease processes.[1] Using CardioMEMS, a pulmonary artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring system, improves quality of
