smooth muscle, and endothelium may contribute to airway remodeling through the combination of mediators and cytokines. There are a variety of genetic, environmental and infectious factors that appear to modulate whether susceptible individuals progress to overt asthma. [2] ## Histopathology The histopathology of asthma is characterized by some structural changes, including epithelial detachment, subepithelial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrate, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy, mucous gland hypertrophy, and vascular changes. These changes can be seen in the proximal airways as well as the distal lung and can be seen in endobronchial biopsies of mild, moderate, and severe asthma. [1] ## History and Physical **Pertinent History** - Onset of symptoms - Environmental triggers (inside and outside the home) and risk factors (such as tobacco use or exposures) - Current therapy and previous history specific to their attacks - History of prior hospitalization or intubation for asthma - Occupation (sensitizers and 10% by irritants cause 90% of occupational asthma)\* - Ask about food allergies - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms - Use of medications such as NSAIDs and aspirin - If exercise triggers shortness of breath **Asthma Symptoms** - Coughing - Shortness of breath - Wheezing - Chest tightness or pressure **Physical Examination Findings during an Acute Exacerbation** - Tachypnea - Wheezing - Accessory muscle use - Retractions - Prolonged expiratory phase - Sometimes there is limited air movement which can occur in severe cases - Sensitizers include animals, bioaerosols, drugs, enzymes, latex, plants, seafood, acid anhydrides, metals, wood dust, persulfate, rosin, and isocyanates. Irritants include chlorine and high-level dust and smoke. [3],[4] ## Evaluation \_**Initial Evaluation** \_ - Pulse oximetry - Peak flow - Spirometry-generally if the measured FEV1(forced expiratory volume in one second) improves more than 12% and increases by 200 milliliters following bronchodilator it is supportive of the diagnosis - Chest x-ray if indicated - Flu swab/RSV can be performed if concerned about a virus triggering asthma - ABG may be warranted depending on the severity of symptoms For any patient with a new onset of asthma, occupational asthma should be considered the following tests can be ordered to verify this: - Measure peak flow - Obtain spirometry and also peak expiratory flow rate that can be monitored inside work and outside of work - Skin prick tests can also be performed to test for allergies - Methacholine challenge can be performed - Specific inhalation challenges can also be completed Biomarkers
