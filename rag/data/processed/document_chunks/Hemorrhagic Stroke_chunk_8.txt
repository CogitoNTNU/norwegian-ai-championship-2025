with clot evacuation. The Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of IntraVentricularr Hemorrhage (CLEAR IVH) trial showed that low-dose rt-PA can be safely administered to stable intraventricular clots and can increase lysis rates.[31] Decompressive craniectomy and hematoma evacuation are now being done more frequently for hemorrhagic stroke. Moussa and Khedr showed the improvement in outcome gained by adding decompressive craniectomy with expansive duraplasty to the evacuation of large hypertensive hemispheric ICH in a randomized controlled trial.[32] Decompressive hemicraniectomy with hematoma evacuation is performed in patients with GCS scores of 8 or less and large hematomas with a volume greater than 60 ml (fig.5).[33] It reduces mortality and may improve functional outcomes. **Cerebroprotection** The secondary injury of hemorrhagic stroke comprises inflammation, oxidative stress, and toxicity of erythrocyte lysates and thrombin. So, strategies to reduce these are being tried. Pioglitazone, misoprostol, and celecoxib are tried to reduce inflammatory damage. Edaravone, flavanoid, and nicotinamide mononucleotide can reduce oxidative stress. The iron chelator deferoxamine is also in the experimental phase. The safety and neuroprotective efficacy of the cell membrane component citicoline (cytidine-5-diphosphocholine) has been shown in some studies.[34] Rosuvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was associated with a better outcome in a trial. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine improves outcomes in SAH by a neuroprotective effect.[35][35] **General Care** Good medical care, nursing care, and rehabilitation are paramount.[20] Common problems include dysphagia, aspiration, cardiac arrhythmias, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infection, etc. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be needed to prevent aspiration. Screening for myocardial ischemia with electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme testing is recommended in hemorrhagic stroke. Intermittent pneumatic compression reduces the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis, but the usefulness of elastic stockings is doubtful. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is advised to reduce disability. Blood glucose should be monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.[36] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses of hemorrhagic stroke are: - Acute hypertensive crisis - Pituitary apoplexy - Cerebral venous thrombosis - Dural sinus thrombosis - Cervical artery dissection - Reversible cerebral vasoconstrictive syndrome (RCVS) - Hemorrhagic neoplasms - Arterio-venous malformations - Meningitis - Acute subdural hematoma - Hemorrhagic infarct Imaging studies such as CT and MRI can rule out these entities.[37] ## Prognosis The poor prognostic factors are coma, large hematoma with volume greater than 30 ml, intraventricular hemorrhage, posterior fossa hemorrhage, old age greater than
