the recovery phase. Hyperuricemia from rhabdomyolysis should be managed with allopurinol and only if the serum uric acid is more than 8 mg/dL. Patients with volume overload, severe acidosis, uremia, and refractory hyperkalemia need hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient to correct the excess amount of electrolyte changes and rhabdomyolysis. **Other Supportive Care** Appropriate use of antibiotics and vasopressors is needed when concomitant sepsis is present. Malignant hyperthermia should be treated with dantrolene sodium. Steroids are used in inflammatory myopathies. Emergent orthopedic consultation is required in the management of compartment syndrome. DIC is managed with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelet transfusion. **Diet in Metabolic Myopathies** Dietary changes may improve symptoms associated with hereditary myopathies. Pain and fatigue associated with phosphorylase deficiency can be decreased with glucose and fructose supplementation. Frequent meals with a high carbohydrate, low-fat diet improve muscle pain and myoglobinuria from carnitine palmityl transferase deficiency. Other metabolic abnormalities may improve with different dietary interventions, and this should be examined closely with a dietician who specializes in such disorders. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis includes: - Hypothermia - Malignant hyperthermia - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - Sepsis - Inflammatory myositis - Inherited myopathies - Guillain-Barré syndrome - Hyperosmolar conditions ## Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials Preclinical studies have been conducted on the following interventions in rhabdomyolysis but have not proven effective: - Vasodilators - Antioxidants - Curcumin - Haptoglobin - Hemopexin - Hepcidin - _α_ 1-microglobulin. Gene therapy is being explored for treating inherited muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne and Becker. This includes various technologies such as read-through of early stop codons and exon skipping. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004, an NF-κB inhibitor) combines structural elements of salicylic acid and docosahexenoic acid and has also been tested in a phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial with some success ([NCT03703882](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03703882)). Vamorolone is a glucocorticoid that stabilizes membranes by reducing lipid peroxidation and inhibiting NF-kB-mediated inflammation; it has also demonstrated functional improvement of symptoms. Many other novel treatments are being studied.[20][63] ## Prognosis For hospitalized patients who develop AKI in the setting of rhabdomyolysis, the mortality rate is 30% to 50%. Severity and duration of the renal injury are the most significant prognostic indicators.[3] There is also a correlation between the severity and duration of crush injury and the need for hemodialysis.[64] ## Complications The most significant complications of rhabdomyolysis include: - Acute kidney injury - Electrolyte abnormalities - Arrhythmias -
