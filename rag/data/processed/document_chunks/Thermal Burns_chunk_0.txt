Cooper. Author Information and Affiliations #### Authors Matthew Edwards1; Jeffrey S.

Burns are complex and dynamic injuries that cause profound activation of platelets and white cells, destruction of the microvasculature by coagulation or thrombosis, and accumulation of edema. Medical treatment of burns is critical, especially when they are a second degree or worse and when a substantial amount of body surface area is affected. There are multiple factors to why thermal burns are difficult to treat, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) may be used as part of the treatment regimen to reduce healing time and improve outcomes. This activity describes the pathophysiology of thermal burns and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in using HBO as part of the management of these patients. **Objectives:** - Summarize the classification of thermal burns. - Describe the presentation of a patient with a thermal burn. - List the treatment options for a patient with a thermal burn - Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with thermal burns.

Burns are complex and dynamic injuries that cause profound activation of platelets and white cells, destruction of the microvasculature by coagulation or thrombosis, and accumulation of edema.[1] Medical treatment of burns is critical, especially when they are second-degree or worse and when a substantial amount of body surface area is affected. There are multiple factors as to why thermal burns are difficult to treat, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) can be used as part of the treatment regimen to reduce healing time and improve outcomes. The characteristic of a burn is described as a zone of coagulation, surrounded
