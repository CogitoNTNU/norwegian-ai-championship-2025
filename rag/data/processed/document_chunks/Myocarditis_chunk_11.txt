(eg, sarcoidosis), and cases associated with autoimmune diseases or ICIs. Initial treatment typically begins with intravenous methylprednisolone (3â€“13 mg/kg/d boluses for 3 days), followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) with a tapering schedule. Management of giant cell myocarditis requires a combination of high-dose intravenous steroids, a calcineurin inhibitor (eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and azathioprine. Intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered in selected cases involving autoimmune, inflammatory, or antibody-mediated mechanisms. [5] **Other therapies** Anticoagulation is indicated in patients with documented atrial or ventricular thrombus or those with atrial fibrillation, in accordance with standard clinical guidelines. **Exercise limitation** In cases of acute myocarditis, it is recommended to restrict activity. Patients should refrain from participating in competitive sports for at least 3 to 6 months following an episode of acute myocarditis.[20] Further recommendations will depend on ongoing clinical assessments, echocardiograms, and Holter monitoring.[21][22] **Alcohol restriction** Alcohol consumption should be restricted to 1 drink per day, which is approximately 14 to 15 grams. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses for acute myocarditis include: - Acute coronary syndrome - Pericarditis - Coronary vasospasm - Stress cardiomyopathy - Drug-induced myocardial injury (eg, cocaine and chemotherapy) - Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy - Infective endocarditis with septic coronary emboli ## Staging The 2024 ACC ECDP outlines a 4-tier staging system for myocarditis, as mentioned below, which is modeled after the heart failure classification system.[5] - Stage A (at risk): Individuals in this stage are exposed to risk factors for myocarditis but show no clinical symptoms or structural, biochemical, imaging, or histopathological evidence of disease. Examples include patients receiving cardiotoxic medications, those with recent viral infections or autoimmune disorders, and individuals with a genetic predisposition or a personal history of myocarditis. - Stage B (asymptomatic): Patients with evidence of myocardial inflammation, detected through imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI, elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, or histopathological findings, but who remain asymptomatic. - Stage C (symptomatic): Patients presenting with symptoms attributable to myocarditis, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or chest pain, along with histopathological evidence of myocarditis, cardiac MRI findings based on the 2018 updated Lake Louise criteria, or elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, supported by additional evidence. - Stage D (advanced): Patients who meet the criteria for Stage C myocarditis and exhibit hemodynamic instability or severe arrhythmias requiring interventions such as mechanical circulatory support or evaluation for heart transplantation. ## Prognosis Given the wide variability in clinical presentation, disease severity, and underlying etiology, the
