for hemodynamic or neurologic complications. The clinical pharmacists assist the interventional team by providing appropriate medication and dosing for the procedure. The critical care pharmacist must help the team adjust other concurrent medications to minimize adverse side effects. Multiple studies have shown that the institution of a PERT can reduce adverse events in pulmonary embolism care [32]. Swift and early diagnosis followed by early treatment is the key to successful pulmonary embolism thrombolysis. ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring Due to the risk of complications during CDT, close monitoring during thrombolytic infusion is required. Most hospitals require intensive care unit-level monitoring during infusion. The patient should receive neurologic checks every hour and regular vascular access site checks to monitor for early signs of possible complications. It is also recommended that the patient be monitored for 24 to 48 hours after infusion for potential complications in the same manner. If any complications (eg, signs of bleeding or an acute neurologic event) are observed or abnormalities are seen in laboratory data, a clinician should be notified immediately. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=51594&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=51594) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/therapeutics/catheter-directed-thrombolysis-of-pulmonary-embolism-pulmonary-thrombolysis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=51594) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/51594/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=51594) ## References 1.
