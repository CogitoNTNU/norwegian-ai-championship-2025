as paralytic ileus, are treated with supportive measures, including bowel rest, correction of metabolic abnormalities, reduction in narcotic use, and the potential use of prokinetic agents like metoclopramide. **Recurrent Obstructions** For patients with recurrent SBO, often due to adhesions, preventive strategies may include minimally invasive surgical techniques and adhesion barriers during surgery to reduce the formation of future adhesions. **Interdisciplinary Approach** Optimal management of SBO relies on collaboration among surgeons, radiologists, gastroenterologists, critical care specialists, pharmacists, and nursing teams. This interdisciplinary approach enhances patient-centered care, reduces complications, and improves outcomes while minimizing the risk of recurrence. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of SBO encompasses a range of conditions that can mimic or contribute to its clinical presentation. Differentiating among these conditions is critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. The primary categories of differential diagnoses include: - **Mechanical** - Adhesions - Hernias - Neoplasms - Gallstone ileus - Volvulus - Intussusception - Foreign bodies - Crohn disease - **Functional** - Postoperative ileus - Ogilvie syndrome - Neuromuscular disorders - Medications - **Gynecological** - Endometriosis - Ovarian torsion or masses - **Vascular** - Mesenteric ischemia - Strangulated obstruction - **Metabolic and systemic** - Electrolyte imbalances - Diabetes mellitus - **Infectious** - Tuberculosis - Intraabdominal abscesses - **Pediatric-specific** - Malrotation with volvulus - Meckel diverticulum - Congenital atresia or stenosis ## Surgical Oncology Neoplasms involving the peritoneal cavity, whether primary or metastatic and benign or malignant, represent a significant cause of SBO. The surgical and oncological management of such cases is tailored based on the type of tumor, its grade, stage, and the extent of peritoneal involvement. Treatment strategies may range from nonoperative medical management to a multimodality approach incorporating chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical intervention. Palliative management plays a critical role for patients with advanced disease or those unsuitable for curative treatment. Approaches to palliate bowel obstruction include medications to reduce symptoms, nasogastric or intestinal decompression tubes, stoma formation, tube enterostomy, or the placement of intestinal stents.[36] These measures aim to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and manage complications associated with obstructive neoplastic conditions. ## Prognosis The prognosis of SBO depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, the patient's overall health status, the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment, and whether the obstruction is simple or complicated (eg, involving strangulation or perforation). Early diagnosis and prompt management significantly improve outcomes, while delays in treatment are associated with higher morbidity and
