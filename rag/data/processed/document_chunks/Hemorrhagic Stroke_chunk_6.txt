- Antihypertensive Treatment in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage(ATACH), Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT), Factor VIIa for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment (FAST), and Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH).[23] The role of surgery in hemorrhagic stroke is a controversial topic. **Blood pressure (BP) Management** BP should be reduced gradually to 150/90 mmHg using beta-blockers (labetalol, esmolol), ACE inhibitor (enalapril), calcium channel blocker (nicardipine), or hydralazine.[4] BP should be checked every 10-15 minutes. ATACH study observed a nonsignificant relationship between the magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction and hematoma expansion and 3-month outcome.[24] But the INTERACT study showed that early intensive BP-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours.[25] It has been found that high SBP is associated with neurological deterioration and death.[20] The American Stroke Association (ASA) recommendation is that for patients presenting with SBP between 150 and 220 mmHg, the acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe and can improve functional outcomes. For patients presenting with SBP >220 mmHg, an aggressive reduction of BP with a continuous intravenous infusion is needed. **Management of Raised Intracranial Pressure (ICP)** The initial treatment for raised ICP is elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees and using osmotic agents (mannitol, hypertonic saline). Mannitol 20% is given at a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg.[4] Hyperventilation after intubation and sedation to a pCO of 28 to 32 mmHg will be necessary if ICP increases further. ASA recommends monitoring ICP with a parenchymal or ventricular catheter for all patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) \<8 or those with evidence of transtentorial herniation or hydrocephalus.[20] The ventricular catheter has the advantage of drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the case of hydrocephalus. The aim is to keep cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) between 50 to 70mmHg. **Hemostatic Therapy** Hemostatic therapy is given to reduce the progression of hematoma.[4] This is especially important to reverse the coagulopathy in patients taking anticoagulants. Vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), etc., are used.[4][20][4] ASA recommends that patients with thrombocytopenia should receive platelet concentrate.[20] Patients with elevated prothrombin time INR should receive intravenous vitamin K and FFP or PCCs. FFP has the risk of allergic transfusion reactions. PCCs are plasma-derived factor concentrates containing factors II, VII, IX, and X. PCCs can be reconstituted and administered rapidly. The FAST trial showed that rFVIIa reduced the growth
