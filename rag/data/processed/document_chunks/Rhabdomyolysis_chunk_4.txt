as other insults, such as hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.[29] **Intensive Care Admission** Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also highly correlated with rhabdomyolysis.[2][18] ICU patients are severely ill, on multiple medications, and prone to electrolyte abnormalities; all of these factors predispose to rhabdomyolysis.[30] In addition, patients who are ventilated often receive propofol, and propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) must be considered. PRIS is a manifestation of propofol toxicity, which is thought to result in uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This results in metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse.[2] Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "[Propofol Toxicity,](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/301)" for further information **Congenital Myopathies** The number of congenital myopathies that can cause rhabdomyolysis is too numerous to list. Some common congenital myopathies that are known to cause rhabdomyolysis include: Disorders of glycogenolysis: myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphorylase kinase deficiency Disorders of glycolysis: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, mutase, and lactate dehydrogenase deficiencies Disorders of purine metabolism: myoadenylate deaminase deficiency Disorders of lipid metabolism: carnitine and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies, short- or long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, lipin-1 deficiency, and Brody myopathy (calcium adenosine triphosphatase [CAT] deficiency) [31] In addition, patients may not have any baseline CPK elevations but may have genetic susceptibility if exposed to external triggers. Mutations in the following genes are proposed to be associated with this risk: _ACADVL_ , _ANO5_ , _CPT2_ , _DMD_ , _DYSF_ , _FKRP_ , _HADHA_ , _PGM1_ , _LPIN1_ , _PYGM_ , and _RYR1._[12] Sickle cell trait affects 300 million people worldwide and also confers an increased risk. Rhabdomyolysis in people with sickle cell trait is especially common with exertional dyspnea. Patients with sickle cell disease are known to have rhabdomyolysis during sickle cell crises, and triggers should be avoided.[32][33][34] **Sepsis** Sepsis can cause rhabdomyolysis via multiple mechanisms, including direct muscle invasion by the infecting pathogen, muscle ischemia from hypoxia, toxin generation, and cytokine-mediated muscle toxicity. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is known to cause rhabdomyolysis by direct muscle invasion and toxin production. Streptococci, salmonellae, and _S aureus_ have been demonstrated in muscle biopsies of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Other pathogens associated with rhabdomyolysis include _Staphylococcus epidermidis,_ _Francisella tularensis, Streptococcus faecalis,_ meningococci _,_ _Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli,_ pseudomonads, _Klebsiella_ ,_Enterococcus faecalis,_ and _Bacteroides._[35] ## Epidemiology Approximately 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported each year in the United States. There is a large variation in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with rhabdomyolysis;
