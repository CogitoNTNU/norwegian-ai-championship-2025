be typed and crossed, but in the meantime, immediate transfusion with O negative blood can be done (O+ for males and women past childbearing years). All patients with blunt abdominal trauma who have signs of peritonitis, frank bleeding, or worsening of clinical signs require an immediate laparotomy. Non-surgical treatment in patients with blunt abdominal injury depends on the clinical features, hemodynamic stability, and results of the CT scan. Advances in angiography can now help control hemorrhage with the use of embolization therapy, which is more cost-effective than laparotomy. In general, the prognosis of patients with blunt abdominal trauma is good.

Mortality rates do vary from 2% to 10% and are most common in people with multiple organ injuries who present with shock and frank hemorrhage. According to the Centers for Disease Control, traumatic injury is the leading cause of death in people younger than the age of 44. Many traumatic injuries can be prevented, beginning with awareness and education. Blunt abdominal trauma is in the top three categories of preventable injuries. These include older adults falls and preventable motor vehicle accidents in teens\*\*.\*\* ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Blunt abdominal trauma results in thousands of admissions each year, resulting in great costs to the healthcare system. While the actual injury is managed by a team of healthcare professionals, there is also a focus on preventing such injuries. The nurses not only are responsible for monitoring these patients but they also have an important role in patient education. To prevent blunt abdominal trauma, the public has to be educated on wearing a safety belt. These safety devices have to be worn even if the motor vehicle comes fitted with airbags. More importantly, the public must be educated about defensive driving
