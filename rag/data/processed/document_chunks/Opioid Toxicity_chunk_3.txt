state-enacted legislation aims to prevent mass opiate prescriptions by healthcare workers and to help stop the diversion of legitimate opiate prescriptions. (DEA, 2016) Results are mixed, but research suggests that opioid databases have reduced opioid prescribing.[8] Additionally, with the assistance of the DEA, statewide registries of controlled substances now help healthcare providers track usage patterns among patients to identify people at high risk for opiate diversion or abuse. While the availability of opiates contributes to opioid addiction, no evidence has yet demonstrated a direct link between opiate abuse and the legitimate use of these drugs for pain. ([DEA](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/faq/rx_monitor.htm), 2016) ## Etiology Both opioids and opiates act on 3 major classes of opioid receptors: μ, κ, δ, and several minor classes, such as nociceptin and ζ. Simply put, μ-receptors are thought to provide analgesia, respiratory suppression, bradycardia, physical dependence, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and euphoria. Agonism of κ-receptors can lead to hallucinations, miosis, and dysphoria. The δ-receptor likely contributes to pain control and mood modulation, but some suggest that μ agonism is necessary for the δ-receptor to function effectively in analgesia.[9][10] Causes of opioid overdose include substance abuse, unintentional and intentional overdose, and therapeutic drug error. The risk of opioid overdose increases in the following situations: - Taking escalating doses - Returning to use after cessation - Having severe medical and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, HIV infection, and lung or liver disease - Combining opioids with sedative medications - Being male - Being younger (20 to 40 years) - Being of White non-Hispanic race [11][12] More than 1.5 million emergency department visits are related to opioid analgesic use. Opioid overdose is a common cause of death. ## Epidemiology **Impact of the Opioid Crisis in the United States** Opiates are frequently prescribed for moderate to severe pain in the United States. These drugs may be prescribed alone or combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants. Based on data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders Systems, the percentage increases in opiate use from 2004 through 2011 were as follows: - Buprenorphine 2318% - Fentanyl 35% - Hydromorphone 140% - Methadone 37% - Morphine 64% - Oxycodone 117% Meanwhile, the use of codeine decreased by 20%. Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has revealed that abuse of all the above opiates increased, with hydromorphone and buprenorphine leading the way with a 438% and 384% increase, respectively.
