HSV and VZV) primarily involves supportive care.[4] Specific treatments for various bacteria, fungi, and others are beyond the scope of this activity. However, as discussed earlier, these treatments should be tailored based on individual clinical presentation and underlying health conditions. Steroids are employed as adjunctive therapy to mitigate the inflammatory response. Dexamethasone, administered 10 to 20 minutes before or concurrently with antibiotics, is supported by evidence, even in cases where the etiology is initially unknown while awaiting culture results.[4] Research has demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing short-term neurologic sequelae and hearing loss, although this benefit is more pronounced in cases of bacterial meningitis.[18] A repeat LP is generally unnecessary but should be considered for patients whose clinical condition does not improve after 48 hours. Continued monitoring and reevaluation of the patient's neurological status are essential in determining the appropriate course of action, ensuring comprehensive and responsive care. After confirming the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis and ensuring the patient's clinical stability, discharge home is usually appropriate except for cases involving older patients, immunocompromised individuals, and children with pleocytosis. Home care instructions should be tailored to specific etiology when discharging the patient. For instance, patients diagnosed with enterovirus should be instructed to maintain excellent hand hygiene and avoid sharing food, as the virus is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route.[2][4] Supportive treatment is essential for all patients, involving pain management and fever control using antipyretics such as acetaminophen, paracetamol, and ibuprofen. In cases of drug-induced meningitis, discontinuing the causative drug is crucial. If necessary, the medication should be replaced with an alternative that does not provoke meningeal irritation.[2][4] ## Differential Diagnosis The signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis are frequently vague and nonspecific, leading to a broad range of possible diagnoses. Headache and fever, among the most common symptoms, significantly shape the differential diagnosis.[2][8] Bacterial meningitis is the most concerning and prevalent alternative cause and should be the default diagnosis until ruled out. Patients with the appropriate clinical presentation should also be evaluated for intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, neoplastic disorders such as leukemia and brain tumors, other types of headaches like migraines, and inflammation of brain structures such as brain abscess and epidural abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis.[2][8] Fever originating from nearly any source can manifest with headache and neck stiffness as associated symptoms. Conditions like urinary tract infections and pneumonia may also present with headaches, body
