most commonly causes pneumonia in people with solid organ transplantation or hematological transplantation \_**Enteroviruses** \_ - RNA - Enteroviruses, although common causes of polio, gastrointestinal, and upper respiratory tract syndromes, are less common causes of viral pneumonia. \_**Varicella-zoster virus** \_ - DNA - Varicella-zoster virus is associated with both chickenpox and shingles and may cause severe types of pneumonia, particularly in non-immune pregnant women, non-gravid-adults with chickenpox. It is a fairly common cause of pneumonia in people with HIV post-shingles outbreak \_**Hantavirus** \_ - RNA - Hantavirus is a zoonotic viral pathogen that emerged in the American Southwest and is associated with rodent feces exposure. - Hantavirus pneumonia is associated with frequent rapid respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. \_**Parechoviruses** _ **_Epstein-Barr_ _virus (EBV)_** - DNA - Epstein-Barr virus, although commonly implicated in mono-like syndromes, can be rarely associated with viral pneumonia. The majority of which occur in people with hematological dyscrasias. \_**Human herpesvirus 6 and 7** \_ - DNA \_**Herpes simplex virus** \_ - DNA - HSV I and II are both associated with viral pneumonia in immune-compromised patients, including those with HIV, solid organ transplantation, and hematopoietic transplantation. \_**Minimi virus** _ \_**Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** \_ - DNA - CMV is a significant cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count less than 100 cells per millimeter squared. - CMV is also frequently implicated in pneumonia in recipients of solid organ transplant and hematopoietic transplant. \_**Measles** \_ - RNA - A childhood exanthemataâ€™s illness that, although less common in the industrialized world secondary to vaccination, remains a major contributor to worldwide childhood mortality secondary to viral pneumonia as a sequela. \*\*_Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Coronavirus)_ \*\* - RNA - A subset of the coronavirus associated with severe pneumonia. This was first observed in the Middle East and had an initial mortality rate of 30%. \_**Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Metapneumovirus)** \_ - RNA - A subset of Coronavirus causing life-threatening pneumonia ## Epidemiology A number of epidemiological cues can aid in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, including the following: **Age** - Viral pneumonia is most common in the very young and in the elderly. There is a steep decline in the incidence of viral pneumonia from adolescence through the fifth or sixth decade of life. Then an upsurge as age-related immunosuppression and age-related pathologies result in immunosuppression increase.[7][8][9] **Pregnancy** - Viral pneumonia continues to be quite concerning in pregnancy.
