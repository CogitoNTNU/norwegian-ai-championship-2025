alone.[21] **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators and Permanent Pacemakers** Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and permanent pacemakers (PPMs) can be continuous monitoring devices with detection algorithms for arrhythmias, including supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. (See **Image.** Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Recording) When appropriately programmed, these devices exhibit sensitivity and specificity of greater than 95% in detecting atrial fibrillation.[22] In specific scenarios, patients with ICDs or PPMs may undergo external ECG monitoring to assess the functionality of implanted devices and identify potential malfunctions. Device interrogation allows data retrieval regarding the frequency and duration of arrhythmias, ventricular rates, and the necessity for shock termination episodes. Additionally, remote monitoring of these devices is available to evaluate arrhythmias and the efficacy of delivered therapies.[23] **Consumer Devices** Rapidly advancing technology has led to the widespread availability of heart rate and rhythm monitors, employing smartphones as convenient storage devices for the captured data. Some of these monitors feature algorithms that can detect irregularities, particularly atrial fibrillation, offering the potential for early detection, treatment, and reduction of stroke risk. Some rhythm monitors in smartphones and handheld devices record single-lead ECG data, including rhythm strips, during symptomatic episodes; this data can be shared with physicians for review to streamline the process of atrial fibrillation detection. The iTransmit study introduced a compact handheld monitoring device that attaches to smartphone cases. This device exhibited 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity in detecting atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation compared to traditional trans-telephonic monitors.[24] Lubitz et al conducted a study involving 455,699 participants who wore smartwatches with photoplethysmography sensors. The identification of irregular heart rhythms prompted the use of a 1-week ECG patch monitor for arrhythmia confirmation. The smartwatches achieved a 97% positive predictive value in detecting irregular heart rhythms compared to the patch monitor.[25] Integrating heart rate and rhythm monitors with smartphones and handheld devices reshapes ambulatory cardiac monitoring. These technological innovations, along with improved algorithms and seamless data sharing, hold significant promise for the early detection and management of atrial fibrillation and other dysrhythmias, advancing personalized cardiovascular care. ## Indications **Syncope** Syncope is the loss of consciousness and postural control followed by spontaneous recovery without residual neurological effects. Syncope has many etiologies, including primary cardiac causes such as bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or inherited disorders such as Brugada or long-QT syndromes. Correlating symptoms with rhythm is the key to confirming cardiac electrical system involvement in syncope.[26] A 12-lead ECG may establish this link; ECG monitoring over an extended period is an
