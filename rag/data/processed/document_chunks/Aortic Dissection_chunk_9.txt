Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain assay: An elevated smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SM-MHC assay is specific for acute aortic dissection. The SM-MHC assay is a rapid 30-minute test that can detect circulating SM-MHC protein. However, smooth muscle proteins can only detect the dissection after it occurs, and they are not useful for predicting or monitoring chronic aortic dissections. **Imaging Modalities** Definitive diagnosis of aortic dissection relies on advanced imaging to identify the intimal tear, evaluate the extent of dissection, and assess complications. The choice of imaging modality is determined by the patientâ€™s stability, clinical scenario, and institutional availability: - Computed tomography angiography - Computed tomography (CTA) is the first-line imaging modality in most cases due to its high sensitivity and specificity, widespread availability, and rapid acquisition.[20] This modality provides detailed images of the aorta, showing the intimal flap, true and false lumens, aortic dilation, hematoma, and complications such as contrast leak (indicating rupture) and branch vessel involvement. CTA is particularly useful in differentiating type A and type B dissections. - Transesophageal echocardiography - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often the imaging modality of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients or when CTA is not available. TEE provides high-resolution, real-time images of the aortic root, ascending aorta, and descending thoracic aorta, enabling accurate detection of proximal dissections (type A) and complications like aortic regurgitation or cardiac tamponade. TEE is also valuable during intraoperative evaluations, guiding surgical or endovascular procedures, and assessing blood flow in the true and false lumens before and immediately after aortic interventions.[7] Findings may include: - Dissection flap with differential Doppler flow - True and false lumen in the ascending aorta - Thrombosis in the false lumen - Central displacement of intimal calcification - Pericardial effusion - Magnetic resonance imaging - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly accurate but less commonly used in acute settings due to limited availability and longer acquisition times. This modality is particularly useful for follow-up in chronic dissections and patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast. MRI offers excellent visualization of branch vessel involvement and soft tissue contrast, making it preferred in selected cases. - Transthoracic echocardiography - Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is less reliable for diagnosing aortic dissections due to poor visualization of the distal aorta but is beneficial for evaluating patients with acute aortic syndromes and assessing complications such as aortic regurgitation, left ventricular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion (suggesting tamponade).[7] TTE can be used
