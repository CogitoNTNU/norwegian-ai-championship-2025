left posterior fascicular block), QRS segments prolonged to greater than 120 milliseconds, Mobitz I second degree AV blocks, complete AV blocks, premature ventricular contraction QRS complexes, early repolarization, or Q waves which represent evidence of a preceding ischemic cardiac event resulting myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram can also identify intrinsic conditions that predispose a patient to intermittent arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (delta waves), Brugada syndrome (semi-right-bundle branch block and coved ST-segment elevation greater than 2 mm with inverted T waves in leads V1-V3), Long-QT syndrome (prolonged QT interval), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy criteria possibly with dagger-shaped Q waves in inferolateral leads), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (epsilon waves).[10] Basic lab tests, such as a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, are frequently performed on patients presenting to an emergency department with syncope. However, these tests do not assist in predicting cardiac etiology.[10] Troponin, similarly, performs poorly as a diagnostic tool among syncopal patients. However, when measured among syncopal patients, the natriuretic peptide has demonstrated utility in identifying patients with cardiac syncope and patients at risk of short-term major adverse cardiac events (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 88%).[11][12] Once cardiac syncope is suspected, if no arrhythmia is identified, echocardiography is perhaps the most useful follow-up diagnostic test as it will directly identify structural abnormalities, as described above. In a retrospective study of 128 patients suspected of having a cardiac syncope, the echocardiogram confirmed diagnosis in 48% of patients and 77% of patients with a specific cardiac diagnosis.[13] CT and MRI are also useful modalities in identifying structural cardiac pathologies, such as pulmonary emboli, cardiac masses, congenital heart disease, sarcoidosis, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.[14][15] If cardiac syncope is not secondary to a mechanical problem and no arrhythmia is detected on initial EKG, stress testing and longer-term rhythm monitoring can be effective in catching the diagnosis. In cases of exertional syncope, exercise stress testing will often reveal the diagnosis.[16] When symptoms are recurrent and frequent, a Holter monitor is recommended. If syncopal or pre-syncopal symptoms are recurrent but not frequent enough to be noted on the Holter monitor, an external loop recorder or implanted cardiac monitor can be used to generate a diagnosis.[10] The electrophysiologic study is another method that has been utilized to identify cases of cardiac syncope. This study involves the placement of catheter tips at multiple locations within the heart. Testing begins at the SA node and
