treatment measures.[1] Functionally, septic shock is defined by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation from 60 ml/kg to 80 mL/kg of either crystalloid or colloid fluid. At this point, the initiation of appropriate vasoactive medications such as beta-adrenergic or alpha-adrenergic drugs is of utmost importance. The progression of organ dysfunction despite high-dose vasoactive administration defines the state of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which carries mortality as high as 75%. While the exact circumstances predicting poor prognosis and death have been difficult to determine, immunologic dissonance (exaggerated pro-inflammatory response) versus immunologic paralysis (exaggerated anti-inflammatory response) have been purported to play a role.[15] ## History and Physical **Early Signs and Symptoms** Sepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome plus an infectious source. Therefore, earlier on in the presentation of sepsis, patients present with the following vital sign changes: - Fever, temperature higher than 38 C, or hypothermia, temperature lower than 36 C - Tachycardia with a heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute in adult patients or less than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients - Tachypnea with respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute in adult patients or more than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients **Signs and Symptoms of Severe Sepsis** Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis and end-organ dysfunction. At this stage, signs and symptoms may include: - Altered mental status - Oliguria or anuria - Hypoxia - Cyanosis - Ileus Patients progressing to septic shock will experience signs and symptoms of severe sepsis with hypotension. Of note, at an early "compensated" stage of shock, blood pressure may be maintained, and other signs of distributive shock might be present, for example, warm extremities, flash capillary refill (less than one second), and bounding pulses, also known as warm shock. This stage of shock, if managed aggressively with fluid resuscitation and vasoactive support, can be reversed. With the progression of septic shock into the uncompensated stage, hypotension ensues, and patients may present with cool extremities, delayed capillary refill (more than three seconds), and thready pulses, also known as cold shock. After that, with continued tissue hypoperfusion, shock may be irreversible, progressive rapidly into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death. ## Evaluation **Laboratory Findings** Findings in sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock are as follows \[16\]: - Hyperglycemia (glucose more than 120 mg/dL) - Leukocytosis (WBC more than 12,000/mm3) or leukopenia (WBC less than 4000/mm3) -
