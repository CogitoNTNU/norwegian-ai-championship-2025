For example, hemodynamically stable patients with primary hypothermia have a survival rate of approximately 100% with full neurological recovery if treated promptly with active external or minimally invasive rewarming techniques. Meanwhile, patients in cardiac arrest treated by ECMO have a survival rate approaching 50%. The absence of hypoxia, trauma, or a serious underlying disease may improve the outcomes for these patients. Full neurological recovery has been reported in accidental hypothermia reaching 14 °C.[19] Ventricular fibrillation in patients with hypothermia has a favorable neurological outcome if resuscitative efforts quickly revive the patient. In contrast, hypothermia-related asystole is generally refractory to normal advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Patients in asystole may need rewarming to 35 °C before cardiac rhythm is restored. Blood potassium may be determined in patients with refractory asystole. A level greater than 12 mEq/L indicates irreversible tissue death and cell lysis. Individuals who are resuscitated quickly usually have good outcomes, though they may have residual frostbite and muscle injury. Extremes of age and severe hypothermia generally have a poorer prognosis. ## Complications Frostbite is a complication of hypothermia that may potentially lead to limb loss if not treated in a timely fashion. This lesion is a form of dry gangrene. A secondary infection can turn it into wet gangrene. Infection by the anaerobic species _Clostridium perfringens_ produces gas, manifesting as crepitus in the skin. Frostbite infection may lead to amputation if refractory to medical treatment. Other
