compensate for their reduced flow with baseline arterial dilation. Patients with significant disease will be maximally dilated and have a limited response to reactive hyperemia or temporary occlusion. For patients with PAD, following temporary occlusion, the return of expected waveforms is markedly delayed. For patients without PAD, the waveform returns rapidly and will increase to two times baseline.[15] ## Interfering Factors **Continuous-wave Doppler** Body habitus, overlying wounds, significant proximal or distal stenosis can confound results at particular levels. Venous flow can also be suspicious for monophasic arterial flow; however, distal compression of the vein that obliterates the signal is evidence that the probe is over a vein. Diabetes has not been shown to affect continuous-wave Doppler waveforms.[16] **Plethysmography** Exercise increases pulse amplitude, which can affect waveform contours that had been normal at rest. Medial calcification of arteries, found in patients with diabetes, can also confound pressure measurements, though less with plethysmography. Patients with diabetes may have a regular appearing ABI but abnormal PVR or velocities from duplex imaging.[17] **Pulse volume recording (PVR)** The downstream disease can affect proximal waveforms, which can be confounding. ## Complications Patient discomfort with inflation of occlusive cuffs. While noninvasive modalities can shed light on the quality of forwarding flow, they are not always predictive of healing potential following an amputation.[18] ## Patient Safety and Education Patients should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. There are no dietary restrictions necessary for these tests, nor should patients stop any previously prescribed medications. ## Clinical Significance For patients with the suspected peripheral arterial disease on history and physical exam, noninvasive imaging (ABI with PPG, toe pressure with PVR) is a reasonable next step for further evaluation before the contrast-enhanced scan or more invasive treatment. Continuous-wave Doppler is a quick, facile bedside adjunct to assess blood flow within a vessel. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=127284&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=127284) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/127284/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=127284) ## References 1.
