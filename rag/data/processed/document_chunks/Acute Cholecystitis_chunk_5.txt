high mortality. The other group of patients who may have a prolonged stay are those with a bile duct stone. These patients require an ERCP prior to cholecystectomy. Again ERCP is not a benign procedure, and patients need to be educated about the procedure and potential complications. Patients with numerous comorbid factors need to be evaluated by the cardiologist prior to general anesthesia. The preoperative nurse should ensure that the patient has the requisite clearance, ECG, chest x-ray, and blood work before the surgery. If there are any deficiencies or concerns, the surgeon should be contacted prior to the procedure.[14][15][16] (Level V) After the procedure, the nurse will monitor vital signs and assist in managing the patient's pain. If there is any significant change in vital signs or the pain cannot be controlled with the medications provided, the surgeon should be consulted. Pre-operatively, the pharmacist should access the patient's medications and make sure that there is no concern for withdrawal or potential interaction with the anesthetics. The clinical team should be apprised if there are any concerns. **Outcomes** For patients with uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, the prognosis is excellent. The mortality rates are very low. Perforation or gangrene of the gallbladder may occur in delayed cases. Patients with acalculous cholecystitis have high mortality varying from 20-50%. In severe cases of acute cholecystitis, the intense inflammation can make surgery difficult, resulting in injury to the bile duct, which has substantial morbidity.[17][18] [Level 5] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19448&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19448) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/acute-cholecystitis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19448) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19448/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19448) [![Image ](/books/NBK459171/bin/acute__chole__ct_1.gif)](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Axial CT Abdomen Acute Cholecystitis Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Image ](/books/NBK459171/bin/acute__cholecystitis__CT_1.gif)](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Abdomen CT, Acute Cholecystitis Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Multiple Biliary Hamartoma, Ultrasound](/books/NBK459171/bin/Figure__1.gif)](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f3/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459171/figure/article-19448.image.f3/?report=objectonly) Multiple Biliary Hamartoma, Ultrasound.
