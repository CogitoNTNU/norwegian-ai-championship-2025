Capture or fusion beats - Negative or positive concordance - Right bundle branch configuration - QRS width >140 ms and left axis - QR, R, or RSr' complex in V1 - RS >1 in V6 or QS in V6 - Left bundle branch configuration - QRS width >160 ms and right axis - Initial R in V1 >30 ms - Slurring or notching of the downstroke of the S-wave in V1-2 - Begin QRS-nadir S-wave in V1-2 - Any Q in V6 **Brugada Criteria:** - Absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads - The longest R to S interval >100 ms in any precordial lead - AV dissociation - Classical criteria for both VT present in both lead V1-2 and V6 If any single one of the above Brugada criteria is present, then VT is diagnosed. **The Vereckei Criteria:** - The presence of AV dissociation - In lead aVR (any one of the following): - The presence of an initial R-wave - Initial R or Q > 40ms - Notch in the descending limb of a negative onset and predominantly negative QRS - Vi/Vt â‰¤ 1 In general, per the AHA, basic criteria to support the diagnosis of VT includes \[9\]: - AV dissociation - QRS complex >0.14 seconds - Monophasic R wave in aVR - Specific QRS morphologies (i.e., positively or negatively concordant QRS complex in precordial leads) - The absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads - An RS interval >100 ms in at least 1 precordial lead ## Treatment / Management Pulseless ventricular tachycardia is a medical emergency, and its management should follow advanced life support guidelines.[7] Pulseless VT requires immediate electrical cardioversion with high-energy defibrillator (150-200 J on biphasic and 360 J on monophasic).[10] Delaying defibrillation for 2 minutes or more decrease survival rate compared with patients received immediate defibrillation (39,3% vs. 22,2%).[11] In a series of shocks, each following shock should be higher in energy than the previous shock. After the first shock delivered, 5 cycles of CPR should be performed. Each CPR cycle should contain 30 chest compressions followed by 2 breaths.[11][7] Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed only until the defibrillator is ready. Defibrillation requires fewer joules if it is done early. After every shock, chest compressions should be performed, along with oxygen delivery and intravenous injection of vasopressors and antiarrhythmic drugs.[7][12] After the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient should
