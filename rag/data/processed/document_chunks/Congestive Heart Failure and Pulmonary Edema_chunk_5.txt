rhonchi or rales may be less prominent). - **Abdominal examination:** Check for ascites, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux. - **Lower extremity examination:** Assess for peripheral edema and skin temperature (cool lower extremities may suggest worse cardiac output).[1][6] ## Evaluation **Classification of Heart Failure** Classification is one of the key determinants of evaluating and treating heart failure. When a patient is in acute or decompensated heart failure, our focus is on expeditious identification and treatment of life threats. Different classification schemes are available when evaluating chronic heart failure. The classification scheme used to categorize the type and degree of heart failure is based on the presentation and affects the treatment and prognosis of the condition. Heart failure classification schemes are generally based on 1 of the following: - Anatomic findings (ie, heart failure with different degrees of ejection fraction) - The chamber of the heart involved (including functional) - Symptoms of the patient All heart failure patients should also be classified based on the American College Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) stages of heart failure, a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification.[1][6] **ACCF/AHA Stages of Heart Failure** The risk of heart failure defines the ACC/AHA stages of heart failure, the presence of active heart failure, and whether structural heart disease is present. The higher the classification, the greater the treatment and interventions the patient may require. - A: No structural heart disease present, high risk for heart failure, and asymptomatic - B: Structural heart disease present, asymptomatic - C: Structural heart disease present and current or previous symptoms of heart failure - D: Heart failure that is refractory and requires specialized interventions [6] **NYHA Functional Classification of Heart Failure** The NYHA classification is a functional classification of heart failure and is based on how much the patients' symptoms limit their physical activity and to what degree physical activity can cause the person to become symptomatic. The grading scale is from I (least severe)to grade IV (the most severe) where the patient cannot perform physical activity and has symptoms at rest.[6] **Diagnostic Tests** Testing for heart failure in patients should be focused on the patient's symptoms, clinical suspicion, and pre-existing or current stage of heart failure. Ordering multiple routine tests should be avoided in all patients with heart failure. Basic tests that should merit consideration for all patients evaluated for heart failure are the following: - Serum electrolytes and kidney function -
