Aging exacerbates these degenerative processes, with a loss of elastin, increased collagen deposition, and microcalcifications in the media, further increasing the risk in older populations.[17] This is the primary physiological reason for the high epidemiological correlation between age and aortic diseases such as aneurysms and dissection.[12] Genetic factors also contribute to aortic dissection risk. Conditions such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome result in altered elastic fiber meshwork, predisposing individuals to aneurysms and dissections. Additionally, congenital cardiovascular diseases like a bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot are associated with structural abnormalities of the aortic wall, further increasing the risk of dissection in affected individuals. ## History and Physical Acute aortic dissection presents with a range of symptoms that reflect the extent of the dissection and the specific cardiovascular structures involved. The patientâ€™s history plays a crucial role in recognizing the dissection, and 3 key elements should be emphasized: the quality, radiation, and intensity of pain at the onset. Study results have identified pain intensity at onset as one of the most reliable historical factors in diagnosing acute aortic dissection. The classic presentation is a sudden, severe, tearing pain that often reaches maximum intensity within minutes. The location of the pain may vary, typically appearing in the anterior chest for dissections involving the ascending aorta and in the back for those involving the descending aorta. Additionally, the pain may migrate as the dissection extends distally. In about 10% of cases, especially in individuals with Marfan syndrome, patients may not report pain, complicating the clinical picture. While the hallmark presentation of acute aortic dissection includes severe chest or back pain, it can be accompanied by neurological symptoms or limb ischemia, depending on the vessels involved. The presence of chest pain with neurological deficits (such as stroke-like symptoms, limb weakness, or paresthesia), the combination of chest and abdominal pain, or chest pain with syncope should all prompt suspicion of acute aortic dissection.[18] Neurological deficits are seen in approximately 20% of patients, and syncope is relatively common, which can be due to various mechanisms, including hypovolemia, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction. If the dissection propagates into peripheral vessels, symptoms like loss of pulses, pain, and paresthesias in the extremities may occur. Physical findings are diverse and may provide critical diagnostic clues. Still, classical signs like blood pressure discrepancies between the upper extremities, pulse deficits, or a diastolic murmur
