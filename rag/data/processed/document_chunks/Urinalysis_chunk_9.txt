sodium excretion generally reflects dietary sodium intake. Increased urinary sodium excretion correlates with increased calcium excretion, making dietary sodium control crucial for managing hypercalciuria. Typically, lower-sodium diets permit up to 1500 mg of dietary sodium daily. Urinary potassium concentration is useful for assessing compliance with treatments like potassium citrate; these supplements should significantly increase urinary potassium levels. **Uric Acid** Uric acid, a byproduct of purine metabolism, is influenced by high-purine foods such as alcohol, anchovies, bacon, beef, herring, lamb, liver, mackerel, organ meats, sardines, and scallops. Elevated levels may also result from metabolic liver conditions, gout, or uricosuric medications such as probenecid, which increase urinary uric acid excretion. High urinary uric acid (hyperuricosuria) predisposes the affected patient by increasing the risk of calcium urolithiasis and uric acid stones. However, most pure uric acid stones are primarily due to acidic urine rather than excess urinary uric acid levels. Additionally, uric acid nephrolithiasis is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome. Patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis are generally treated with urinary alkalinization therapy, such as potassium citrate, aiming for an optimal urine pH of 6.5 to 7. For hyperuricosuric patients who develop calcium-based stones, allopurinol is recommended to lower urinary uric acid levels to 600 mg daily or less. Please see the StatPearls' companion resources, "[Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis](/pubmed/32809561)," "[Hyperuricosuria](/pubmed/32965872)," and "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/40765)," for more information.[[28]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32809561) **Urine Volume and Creatinine** Decreased urine volume is a significant risk factor for stone disease, as concentrated urine increases the supersaturation of stone-forming salts. A 1999 prospective trial by Borghi et al provided results showing that an optimal urinary volume of 2500 mL/d can help reduce stone risk.[22] While increasing urine volume beyond this level may further lower the risk, achieving such high volumes can be challenging and may lead to frequent urination, which some patients find bothersome. Urine creatinine excretion helps assess the accuracy of a timed urine collection. As a byproduct of muscle metabolism, creatinine excretion remains relatively stable based on muscle mass. The average daily creatinine excretion is 18 to 25 mg/kg for males and 15 to 20 mg/kg for females. A lower-than-expected creatinine excretion value typically indicates an incomplete collection. Creatinine clearance, described in the next section, provides further insights into kidney function. ## Clinical Significance **Measurement of Renal Function (Creatinine Clearance)** Numerous formulas are available to estimate renal function, with most relying on creatinine levels.
