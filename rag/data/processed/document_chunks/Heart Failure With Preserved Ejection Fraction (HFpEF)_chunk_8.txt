patients with HFpEF.[36][53] Ultimately, it is this constellation of dysfunctional processes at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels that causes the clinical constellation of signs and symptoms observed in patients with HFpEF, namely exertional dyspnea progressing to dyspnea at rest, fatigue, decreased organ perfusion, pulmonary congestion, and edema.[2] ## Histopathology Endomyocardial biopsy is neither required nor routinely recommended when diagnosing or managing chronic HFpEF. However, multiple studies have suggested that, unlike the myocardial remodeling in HFrEF driven by cardiomyocyte loss, cardiac remodeling in HFpEF may stem from coronary microvascular inflammation and deranged intramyocardial signaling.[54] The myocardium of patients with HFpEF demonstrates upregulated E-selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression, which may contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and stiffness.[55] Cardiomyocytes from patients with HFpEF demonstrate increased levels of collagen and titin, which may also contribute to ventricular stiffness.[56] Canine studies have demonstrated that increased phosphorylation of titin improves ventricular diastolic distensibility.[57] ## History and Physical Patients with HFpEF typically exhibit intolerance to physical activity characterized by exertional dyspnea (98%) and fatigue (59%).[2][58] With the progression of HFpEF, these symptoms will occur with lower activity levels and may be accompanied by evidence of congestion.[2][58] Some patients with HFpEF are clinically asymptomatic, or their symptoms are so mild they go unnoticed. The remaining clinical manifestations of HFpEF are typically the same as seen in other heart failure subtypes, including HFrEF. Obtaining a thorough medical history and performing a comprehensive physical examination facilitate the classification of heart failure, which helps guide therapeutic interventions. The signs and symptoms of heart failure overlap with many other disease processes. Worsening ventricular dysfunction results in more severe symptoms and apparent signs. However, there is no single sign or symptom pathognomonic for heart failure. **Medical History** A comprehensive medical history should include a thorough medication history, including patient medication compliance. Inquiries into cardiovascular risk factors, known cardiovascular diagnoses, and prior cardiovascular interventions are mandatory. Any family history of heart failure in the 3 previous generations should be noted; many cardiomyopathies have a genetic component. Quantification of current and prior tobacco and alcohol use, as well as any history of exposure to drugs of abuse, must be pursued. An assessment of social determinants of health is recommended.[1] Symptoms that patients with heart failure commonly describe include dyspnea, initially with exertion and then at rest. Patients may describe orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.[2][58] Dulled mental status or "brain fog" is not uncommon. Daytime
