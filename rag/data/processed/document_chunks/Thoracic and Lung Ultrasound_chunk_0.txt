This is in part because ultrasound equipment is available in many settings, more training programs are educating trainees on point of care ultrasound (POCUS), and ultrasound can be done rapidly without exposure to radiation or contrast. Studies have shown equivalent or even improved sensitivity and specificity of POCUS compared with conventional chest radiography, and bedside ultrasounds may aid in differentiating between pathologies that conventional radiographs cannot. Following trauma, thoracic ultrasound can assist with diagnosing pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, and chest wall hematomas. Non-traumatic uses for thoracic ultrasound include evaluation for pleural effusions, infections such as pneumonia or empyema, pulmonary edema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing thoracic ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure. **Objectives:** - Outline the indications for thoracic ultrasound. - Describe the technique involved in performing a thoracic ultrasound. - Review the complications associated with thoracic ultrasound. - Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing coordination and communication to advance the utilization of thoracic ultrasound for the diagnosis of pleural cavity pathology to improve patient outcomes.

Additionally, ultrasound circumvents many of the issues that arrive with traditional radiography, such as delay of care and radiation exposure. In an unstable patient, who is unfit for extended delays due to transport to the CT scanner or even bedside chest radiography, bedside ultrasound is readily available to physicians. In addition, numerous studies have shown equivalent or often improved sensitivity and specificity of POCUS compared with conventional radiography, namely chest x-rays. Bedside ultrasound (US) may also aid in differentiating between pathologies
