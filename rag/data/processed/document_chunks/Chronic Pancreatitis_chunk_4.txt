pancreas is observed with PRSS1-associated hereditary chronic pancreatitis, CFTR mutations, and hypertriglyceridemic chronic pancreatitis.[22] ## History and Physical Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with prolonged abdominal pain, often with intermittent pain-free periods. The pain may improve when leaning forward. However, some patients remain asymptomatic. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea (greasy, foul-smelling, difficult-to-flush stools), and weight loss. As the disease progresses, glucose intolerance or pancreatic diabetes may develop. During acute episodes of severe abdominal pain, patients may instinctively draw their knees towards their chest to alleviate discomfort. On physical examination, focal or diffuse abdominal tenderness is commonly observed. In some cases, a palpable mass may indicate the presence of a pseudocyst. Signs of malnutrition are frequently observed in long-standing diseases. ## Evaluation When chronic pancreatitis is suspected, the new mechanistic definition can aid in diagnosis. This approach integrates clinical features (typical signs, symptoms, and family history) with risk factors (see **Table.** Modified TIGAR-O Pancreatitis Risk/Etiology Checklist). Biomarkers further support the diagnosis and may include the following: [23] - Serum markers - Amylase - Lipase - Glucose - IgG4 - Triglycerides - Tumor markers - Nutritional deficiencies - Hypovitaminosis A, D, K, and B12 - Additional tests - Sweat chloride levels - Pancreatic biopsies The 72-hour quantitative fecal fat collection is the most definitive test for advanced pancreatic insufficiency to evaluate steatorrhea. A fecal fat excretion of greater than 7 g/d confirms the diagnosis. Alternatively, a fecal elastase-1 level can be performed using a single random stool sample to assess pancreatic insufficiency.[24] - Normal fecal elastase level: > 500 µg/g of stool - Borderline range: 200 to 500 µg/g (nonspecific, may be normal) - Moderate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: 100 to 200 µg/g - Severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: \<100 µg/g Although neither test is highly accurate, fecal elastase testing is less reliable than the 72-hour fecal fat collection but is more practical and widely used in clinical practice. For patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis-related pain, and signs of maldigestion, such as steatorrhea or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, confirmatory imaging with CT or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography testing (MRCP) should be the initial diagnostic step. **Diagnostic Algorithm** - MRCP and CT are the preferred imaging modalities. - Detect calcifications (hallmark sign), pancreatic enlargement, and ductal obstruction or dilation. - MRCP is more sensitive and specific for chronic pancreatitis than transabdominal ultrasound or plain x-rays, though both can reveal calcifications. - Endoscopic
