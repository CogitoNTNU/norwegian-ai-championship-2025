and cushion tissues during embryonic development.[6] ## Indications The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines categorize recommendations into 3 main categories, as outlined below: - Class I - Strongly recommended based on solid evidence - Class II - This class is divided into 2 subcategories: - IIa - Benefits outweigh risks, supported by moderate evidence - IIb - May be considered useful, but the evidence is less conclusive - Class III - Not recommended due to ineffectiveness or potential harm Additionally, the recommendations are graded according to levels of evidence, as outlined below. These classifications provide a structured approach to making clinical decisions. - Level A - High-quality evidence from multiple trials - Level B - Moderate-quality evidence from a single trial or non-randomized studies - Level C - Based on expert opinion or limited data from smaller studies The 2019 ESC guidelines recommend an electrophysiology study for patients with recurrent symptomatic SVT when the arrhythmia mechanism is unclear, and for those with syncope suspected to be due to SVT when noninvasive testing is inconclusive (Class I and IIa recommendations). Catheter ablation is recommended for symptomatic SVT patients who desire definitive treatment or have not responded to medical therapy. This procedure is also indicated for those with severe symptoms, such as syncope (Class I). Additionally, catheter ablation should be considered for asymptomatic patients with preexcitation who have experienced arrhythmic syncope, rapid atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to electrical dyssynchrony (Class IIa). Catheter ablation may also be considered for patients with infrequent but severe episodes of SVT in whom medical therapy is not preferred or is contraindicated, as well as for those with asymptomatic preexcitation and low-risk accessory pathways (Class IIb). The benefits of catheter ablation include reduced hospitalizations and an improved quality of life.[7] ## Contraindications Although there are no absolute contraindications to performing electrophysiology maneuvers for differentiating SVTs, caution is warranted due to the potential risks associated with electrophysiology studies, particularly those related to anesthesia and the patient's underlying comorbidities. ## Technique or Treatment **Preparation** Although electrophysiology studies can vary in approach, the fundamental principles are consistent. Typically, 4-electrode catheters are inserted for electrical recording and pacing, including: - High right atrium - HIS bundle - Right ventricle (RV) - Coronary sinus A fifth catheter is used for radiofrequency or cryoablation. **Electrophysiology Study** Observations and maneuvers are typically categorized based on whether they are performed during
