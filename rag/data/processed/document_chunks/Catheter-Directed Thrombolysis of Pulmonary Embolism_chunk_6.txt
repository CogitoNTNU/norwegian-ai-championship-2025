its impact.[24][25][24] This data provides valuable insights into PERT's effectiveness in enhancing patient outcomes, care practices, cost-efficiency, and overall pulmonary embolism treatment knowledge. ## Preparation Before initiating the procedure, the practitioner should inspect the thrombolysis catheter delivery system to ensure all components are present. This procedure necessitates a fully operating catheterization laboratory. Healthcare professionals must adhere to proper sterile techniques, including drapes, gloves, and gowns. ## Technique or Treatment The EKOS system employs low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a specialized catheter to disaggregate fibrin strands within the clot.[22] This disaggregation increases the clot's permeability, enabling deeper penetration and enhanced efficacy of co-administered thrombolytic agents like rt-PA. Additionally, the ultrasound energy generates microstreaming effects, further facilitating drug transport within the clot.[26] It is essential to take a step-by-step approach to USAT. **Patient Selection and Preparation** Meticulous patient selection based on risk stratification and established inclusion/exclusion criteria is paramount for successful US-CDT. Informed consent and pre-procedural imaging, such as echocardiography, are mandatory steps. **Catheter Placement** Venous access is typically obtained via the common femoral vein. A guidewire and angiographic catheter navigate to the embolic occlusion in the pulmonary artery. The EKOS-IDDC replaces the angiographic catheter, allowing a precise positioning of the MSD-containing ultrasound transducers within the IDDC.[22] **Treatment Delivery** Simultaneous rt-PA infusion and saline coolant administration commence through the IDDC at precisely determined rates. Adjustments based on patient factors, such as weight and comorbidities, may be made to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize complications. Concomitant ultrasound delivery begins, utilizing specific protocols based on institutional guidelines and patient characteristics. Hemodynamic monitoring and continuous ECG are essential throughout the procedure to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy. The initial treatment duration varies depending on institutional protocols and individual patient factors, typically 12 to 24 hours. Rt-PA dose and ultrasound delivery adjustments are tailored to the patient's clinical response and potential complications. Close monitoring for bleeding, compartment syndrome, and other potential complications is crucial throughout the procedure. Upon treatment completion, the EKOS devices are meticulously removed. Post-procedural imaging, such as a CT scan, evaluates treatment efficacy and identifies residual thrombus. Patients receive ongoing anticoagulation and clinical monitoring as per standard protocols. **The Bashir Endovascular Catheter** The BEC, a 7-F catheter with a unique expandable "basket" featuring 48 orifices, offers a novel pharmaco-mechanical approach for treating acute pulmonary embolism. This design facilitates clot breakdown by establishing a wide passage for blood flow within the blockage, enhancing the
