1. Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia 1. New ischemic ECG changes 1. Development of pathological Q waves 1. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology **Cardiac Procedural Myocardial Injury** Cardiac procedural myocardial injury is arbitrarily defined by increases in cTn values (>99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% of the baseline value when it is above the 99th percentile, but it is stable or falling. **Coronary Intervention-related Myocardial Infarction** Coronary intervention-related MI is arbitrarily defined by the elevation of cTn values >5 times the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values. In patients with elevated pre-procedure cTn in whom the cTn levels are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, the post-procedure cTn must rise by >20%. However, the absolute post-procedural value must still be at least five times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required: 1. New ischemic ECG changes 1. Development of new pathological Q waves 1. Angiographic findings are consistent with a procedural flow-limiting complication such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery or a side branch occlusion or thrombus, disruption of collateral flow, or distal embolization **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)-Related Myocardial Infarction** CABG-related MI is arbitrarily defined as an elevation of cTn values >10 times the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values. In patients with elevated pre-procedure cTn in whom cTn levels are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, the post-procedure cTn must rise by >20%. However, the absolute post-procedural value still must be greater than ten times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required: 1. Development of new pathological Q waves 1. Angiographic documented new graft occlusion or new native coronary artery occlusion 1. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology ## Clinical Significance The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cardiac events is an essential component of working in the emergency department.[16] The development and implementation of troponin testing have had a massive influence on the practice of emergency medicine.[29] It is important to recognize the drawbacks and potential flaws when using troponin testing and to keep the entire clinical picture in mind when making
