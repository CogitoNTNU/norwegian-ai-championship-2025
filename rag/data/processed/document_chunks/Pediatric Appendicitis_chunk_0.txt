In the United States alone, approximately 300,000 hospital visits are reported annually related to appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is characterized by inflammation of the vermiform appendix, and patients typically present emergently within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Despite significant advancements in managing acute appendicitis with primary antibiotic therapy, the definitive treatment option for acute appendicitis continues to be surgical. Appendectomy is a relatively safe surgical procedure; the global mortality rate for appendicitis is very low. However, if left untreated or the diagnosis is delayed, patients are at risk for appendiceal perforation, abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death. The significance of this condition in terms of both pediatric and general surgery underscores the need for accurate diagnosis, prompt intervention, and appropriate management. This activity reviews the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of acute appendicitis and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Differentiate the clinical manifestations and physical examination findings associated with acute appendicitis. - Implement evidence-based diagnostic algorithms and guidelines for evaluating and managing acute appendicitis. - Assess and manage the complications of acute appendicitis before and after therapeutic intervention. - Collaborate with radiologists, surgeons, and other healthcare professionals in the timely and coordinated management of acute appendicitis.

However, the presenting symptoms may be more indolent and less severe in cases with perforation with a contained abscess.[1][2][3][4] Notably, acute appendicitis is the leading cause of abdominal surgery in children and the most prevalent abdominal surgical emergency worldwide.[5][6] The significance of this condition in terms of both pediatric and general surgery underscores the need for accurate diagnosis, prompt intervention, and appropriate management.
