on the patient's symptoms, clinical suspicion, and pre-existing or current stage of heart failure. Ordering multiple routine tests should be avoided in all patients with heart failure. Basic tests that should merit consideration for all patients evaluated for heart failure are the following: - Serum electrolytes and kidney function - Complete blood count - Lipid level - Liver function tests - Troponin level if there is concern that myocardial injury is the cause of symptoms - Thyroid-stimulating hormone - An electrocardiogram Other tests that may be considered based on the severity and classification of the patient's condition are: - **Chest x-rays** assess for signs of pulmonary congestion or edema in acute decompensated heart failure (see Image. Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph). - **Biomarkers** are used to assess patients with more complex symptoms than acute heart failure (ie, B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). For further information on the recommendations for evaluating heart failure, please see the American Heart Association and New York Heart Association classification-based heart failure guidelines.[1][2][6] ## Treatment / Management **Treatment of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema** The focus of treatment for patients with heart failure is dependent on the severity of the symptoms and the stage of heart failure. When patients are in acute decompensated heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, the most important focus for therapeutic interventions is the enhancement of hemodynamic status through the reduction of vascular congestion and improving preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility.[2] In flash pulmonary edema, where there is a rapid onset of heart failure, the initial management and treatment goals are very similar to acute decompensated heart failure. Treatment options for acute decompensated heart failure and flash pulmonary edema are as follows: - **ABCs:** As with all patients, it is crucial to assess airway, breathing, and circulation in the initial evaluation and initiate appropriate management based on patient status. In decompensated heart failure, patients should be hooked up to cardiorespiratory monitoring, have IV access and oxygen administered if hypoxic or tachypnoeic, have an electrocardiogram performed, and have labs drawn based on clinical suspicion and patient condition. - **Diuretics:** Most patients presenting with heart failure have a form of volume overload. AHA and ACC guidelines recommend intravenous loop diuretic administration to treat fluid overload. Intravenous administration is preferred over oral diuretics to maximize the bioavailability of the medication and clinical effects. Furosemide is a common treatment for acute decompensated
