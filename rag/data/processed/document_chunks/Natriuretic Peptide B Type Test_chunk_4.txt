Clarification of dilution responses ## Interfering Factors BNP and NT-proBNP levels may be affected by specific comorbidities, such as chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[23] Levels are higher in patients with renal failure, diabetes, and ACS and lower in patients with obesity.[7] Decreasing renal function with age may be partly responsible for the increase in BNP/NT-proBNP. In the absence of heart failure, the concentration of BNP/NT-proBNP increases in patients with a decreasing glomerular filtration rate.[35] It is also possible that elderly subjects who appear healthy may have declining cardiac function not detectable by current noninvasive techniques.[36] The body mass index (BMI) is another variable influencing the reference intervals for BNP and NT-proBNP. Patients with a BMI in the obese range have lower BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations than patients with a normal or underweight BMI. There have been several theories as to the mechanism for these observations.[37] Natriuretic peptide receptors are found in high concentrations in adipose tissues, suggesting that BNP is degraded. However, this does not account for the obesity effect seen for NT-proBNP, which is not degraded by these receptors.[38] Therefore, comparisons of levels among patients are less meaningful than tracking the peptide trajectory of an individual patient.[39] All immunoassays for BNP and NT-proBNP are heterogeneous, using a separation step between bound and free antibodies; there are no problems with photometric interferents such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, or lipemia.[40] The cross-reactivity of assays for BNP and NT-proBNP towards proBNP is an important consideration since it is now known that proBNP also circulates in the blood of patients with heart failure.[41] Because proBNP is the precursor protein to both BNP and NT-proBNP, the epitopes used to raise antibodies for these latter two peptides are also present in the proBNP peptide structure.[42] proBNP also exists in the blood of heart failure patients as an O-linked glycoprotein. There are seven potential glycosylation sites from the center of the molecule (from the non-BNP amino acid sequences).[43] There have been studies that have tested the cross-reactivity of proBNP towards commercial BNP and NT-proBNP assays. For BNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 17% to 38% for glycosylated proBNP and 5% to 14% for non-glycosylated proBNP.[44] For NT-proBNP, the cross-reactivity ranged from 29% to 249% for non-glycosylated proBNP but with no cross-reactivity towards glycosylated proBNP.[45] The relative composition of blood with regard to the various BNP, NT-proBNP, proBNP,
