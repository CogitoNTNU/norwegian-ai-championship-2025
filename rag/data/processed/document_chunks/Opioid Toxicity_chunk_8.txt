effects common to other opiates. However, a unique feature of pentazocine is its potential to cause nightmares, hallucinations, and delusions. Pentazocine has a high ceiling effect, meaning that a high dose must be reached before further drug administration stops providing additional pain relief, although the risk of side effects still increases. The pharmacological effects of pentazocine may be reversed by naloxone, but extremely high doses (10 to 115 mg) are required. Propoxyphene is an opiate analgesic once prescribed to manage mild pain and cough. Sporadic cases of poisoning with this drug continued even after it was withdrawn from the American market in 2010 due to concerns about serious adverse cardiac events. Despite the ban, the drug remains available illegally and contributes to a significant number of poisonings each year. Naloxone can reverse the toxicity of propoxyphene but does not address the cardiac arrhythmias caused by the drug. These arrhythmias, resulting from the quinidine-like effects of propoxyphene, are unresponsive to naloxone. Propoxyphene can cause sinus bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias. Immediate treatment involves the administration of sodium bicarbonate. The combination of diphenoxylate and atropine is commonly used to treat diarrhea. The opioid diphenoxylate acts as an antidiarrheal agent. The anticholinergic atropine is added to deter deliberate misuse and overdose. Atropine itself has no antidiarrheal activity. High doses of this combination can cause primarily anticholinergic side effects, respiratory depression, and constipation. Cardiac toxicity, including prolongation of the QRS and QTc intervals leading to ventricular arrhythmias, is the main concern with the use of this drug combination. **Body Packers and Stuffers** Transporting illicit drugs in the body has become increasingly common over the past 2 decades. These individuals, often called "drug mules" or "carriers," ingest drugs contained in plastic bags or condoms. The number of packages ingested typically ranges from 1 to 3 dozen. Some may rupture despite being well-packaged, leading to systemic toxicity. Others may develop complications such as bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation, requiring surgery. Additionally, when pursued by law enforcement, these individuals may quickly swallow smaller quantities of drugs to evade arrest. Body stuffers are at a higher risk of adverse effects, as the drugs they transport are often improperly packaged. Symptoms can appear rapidly following ingestion, and aggressive medical intervention is often necessary to prevent overdose and death. ## History and Physical **History** Most patients who overdose on opiates are lethargic or comatose. Thus, the history is typically
