VTE include: - Fracture of lower limb - Hospitalization for heart failure or atrial fibrillation/flutter within the previous 3 months - Hip or knee replacement - Major trauma - History of previous venous thromboembolism - Central venous lines - Chemotherapy - Congestive heart failure or respiratory failure - Hormone replacement therapy - Oral contraceptive therapy - Postpartum period - Infection (specifically pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and HIV) - Cancer (highest risk in metastatic disease) - Thrombophilia - Bed rest longer than 3 days - Obesity - Pregnancy Cancer carries a high risk for thrombus formation and, hence, PE. Pancreatic cancer, hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk for VTE.[8] Infection anywhere in the body is a common trigger for VTE.[9] Myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure increase the risk of PE. Patients with VTE have an increased risk of subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction.[10][11] **Types of Pulmonary Embolism** Categorizing PE based on the presence or absence of hemodynamic stability is crucial. Hemodynamically unstable PE, previously called massive or high-risk\*\*\*\* PE, is PE that results in hypotension as defined by systolic blood pressure \<90 mm Hg or a drop in systolic blood pressure of â‰¥40 mm Hg from baseline or hypotension that requires vasopressors or inotropes), the old term "massive" PE does not describe the size of the PE but rather the hemodynamic effect. Patients with a hemodynamically unstable PE are more likely to die from obstructive shock (ie, severe right ventricular failure). Hemodynamically stable PE is a spectrum ranging from small, mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic PE (low-risk PE or small PE) to PEs that cause mild hypotension that stabilizes in response to fluid therapy or those that present with right ventricular dysfunction (submassive or intermediate-risk PE) but are hemodynamically stable. ## Epidemiology Acute PE incidence ranges from 39 to 115 per 100,000 population annually; for DVT, the incidence ranges from 53 to 162 per 100,000 people.[12] After coronary artery disease and stroke, acute PE is the third most common type of cardiovascular disease.[13] Furthermore, the incidence of acute PE is higher in males than females.[14] PE complicated by pulmonary infarction occurs at a rate of 16% to 31%.[7] Overall, PE-related mortality is high, and in the United States, PE causes 100,000 deaths annually.[14] However, the mortality rates attributable to PE are challenging to estimate accurately because many patients with sudden cardiac death are thought
