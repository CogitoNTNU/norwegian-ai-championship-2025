The most common cause of HF is ischemic heart disease, but other factors, such as hypertension, valvular disease, and myocarditis, also contribute to its development. HF is classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and clinical staging. Common symptoms of HF include shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention, and edema. This course explores the complexities surrounding HF's extensive etiologies, assessment, classification, and staging. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in identifying HF, performing the recommended multifaceted evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional approach when managing this condition, which is essential to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. **Objectives:** - Evaluate clinical presentation and apply the staging and classification systems of heart failure. - Assess the etiology of heart failure using clinical assessment and appropriate diagnostic tests. - Develop a management plan for patients with heart failure based on their clinical stage and investigations. - Collaborate with interprofessional healthcare teams, including cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists, and pharmacists, to ensure coordinated and comprehensive care for heart failure patients.

HF is a common disorder worldwide with a high morbidity and mortality rate. With an estimated prevalence of 26 million people worldwide, CHF contributes to increased healthcare costs, reduces functional capacity, and significantly affects quality of life. Accurately diagnosing and effectively treating the disease is essential to prevent recurrent hospitalizations, decrease morbidity and mortality, and enhance patient outcomes.[1] The etiology of HF is variable and extensive. Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of HF. The general management of HF aims to relieve systemic and pulmonary congestion and stabilize hemodynamic status, regardless of the cause. The treatment of
