in the disease course and have worse outcomes.[8] The risk profile differs between older and younger patients: older patients are more likely to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, prior aortic aneurysm, or iatrogenic dissection, while younger patients, particularly those younger than 40, are more likely to have connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome. Type A dissections involving the ascending aorta are twice as common as type B dissections and are more likely to be fatal without urgent intervention. Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor, present in about 75% of patients, while other risk factors include atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders, and previous cardiac surgery. ## Pathophysiology Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the aortic wall allows blood to enter the space between the intima and media, creating a false lumen. The aortic wall has 3 layers: the intima, media, and adventitia. Chronic exposure to high pulsatile pressure and shear stress, especially in susceptible individuals, weakens these layers, leading to the initial intimal tear. This tear typically occurs in the ascending aorta, particularly in the right lateral wall, where shear forces are highest. The blood then flows into the space between the intima and media, expanding the false lumen. In most cases, the dissection propagates either anterograde (distally) or retrograde (proximally). The direction of propagation dictates the complications that arise: distal propagation can obstruct blood flow to the major branches of the aorta, leading to ischemia in affected territories such as the coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral arteries. Proximal propagation, as seen in type A dissections, often causes life-threatening complications like acute aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, or even rupture.[9] As the false lumen develops, it typically becomes larger than the true lumen, increasing the risk of aneurysm formation and eventual rupture if left untreated. The 3 most common sites for acute aortic dissection include: - The area approximately 2 to 2.5 cm above the aortic root (the most frequent site) - Just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery - Within the aortic arch These dissections are highly lethal if not recognized and treated promptly, often leading to death due to aortic rupture or tamponade. ## Histopathology Aortic dissection is an acute life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen between the intima-media and
