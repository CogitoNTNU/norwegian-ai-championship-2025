inhibitor, and anticoagulation, should be implemented as the interventional cardiologist recommends.[2][3][4][24] After adequate reperfusion, patients should be admitted to a monitored coronary care or intensive cardiac care unit, with subsequent management and ancillary testing recommended by current guidelines.[2][3][5][4] ## Differential Diagnosis Though most cases of this pattern are associated with an acute occlusion of the LAD artery, similar changes in repolarization can also be present in other clinical scenarios. Among these, hyperkalemia should be considered, although this condition can typically be differentiated by a distinct clinical presentation and T waves that tend to be narrow and sharply peaked.[22][23][25] Moreover, as discussed by Xu et al, tachycardia can also be associated with the upsloping depression of the ST-segment and cTn elevation.[14] ## Prognosis The de Winter ECG pattern is associated with acute coronary artery occlusion, most notably the LAD.[8][9] As such, early recognition and treatment allocation are critical to allow adequate reperfusion and improve the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with a large anterior MI.[2][26][4] ## Deterrence and Patient Education As early diagnosis plays a prominent part in the management of individuals with an ACS and given the potential adverse outcomes associated with an acute LAD occlusion, reducing any barriers to seeking medical care is essential. Therefore, patients should be counseled on the most common symptoms associated with ACS and the importance of seeking urgent medical evaluation.[2][26][4] In this way, patient delays may be avoided, thus reducing total ischemic time.[2][4] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The de Winter electrocardiogram pattern highly suggests acute occlusion of the LAD artery.[8][9][10] Given this background, all members involved in the interprofessional care process of individuals presenting with acute chest pain should be able to identify this ECG finding expertly, thus streamlining the diagnostic and therapeutic process of this challenging and high-risk subset of patients. Healthcare practitioners in the many departments that may encounter these patients, including primary care, emergency room, cardiology, and internal medicine, should recognize that further evaluation is warranted when the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is present, leading to improved recognition of potential abnormalities. Additionally, electrocardiogram technicians, cardiac procedural staff, and pharmaceutical clinicians are often needed to provide care to these patients when diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes. As a result, clinicians can use this finding to help guide treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.[2][5][10][26][4] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=98283&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=98283) - [Click here for a simplified
