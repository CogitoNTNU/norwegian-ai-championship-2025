with previous histories of respiratory disease, most notably asthma, are at the highest risk. Treated with inhaled beta-agonists is the first-line treatment for wheezing; albuterol alone or as ipratropium bromide/albuterol. If there is refractory wheezing, intravenous magnesium is appropriate with dosage and treatment similar to severe asthma exacerbations. **Vasopressors** Vasopressors may be substituted when a patient requires more doses of epinephrine but have unacceptable side effects from the epinephrine intravenous infusion (arrhythmia or chest pain). If no clear second-line pressor is identified, treatment guidelines would follow those of any other patient in hypotensive shock. **Glucagon** Glucagon is the reversal agent for beta-blockers and can be used as such if needed in cases where anaphylaxis is resistant to treatment in patients with beta-blockade. Known side effects include nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, dizziness, and hyperglycemia. A therapeutic agent under research: **Sirtuin 6** A NAD-dependent deacetylase suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type C transcription. This, in turn, leads to negative regulation of the FcERI signaling cascade in mast cells. Hence, activation of Sirt6 can be tried as a therapeutic strategy for anaphylaxis.[18] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses for anaphylaxis include: - Angioedema - Anxiety - Arrhythmias - Asthma - Carcinoid syndrome - Epiglottitis - Foreign-body airway obstruction - Gastroenteritis - Mastocytosis - Myocardial ischemia/infarction - Seizure - Vasovagal episode - Vocal cord dysfunction ## Prognosis With rapid and adequate treatment and monitoring, the risk of morbidity and mortality is low. Rapid access to medical care and identification of the disease process are essential to patient prognosis. As stated above, the first hour after symptoms exposure is responsible for half of the related fatalities.[15][19][10] Hospital admission is required in 4% or less of acute allergic reactions diagnosed in the emergency department. If epinephrine is required, as in cases of anaphylaxis, complete resolution is noted. Emergency department observation for 4 hours is recommended. If no further intervention is required, the patient can be discharged home with a prescription for an epinephrine autoinjector, and follow-up is appropriate. If the patient requires airway intervention, is refractory to treatment, or is deemed unstable, admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring is advised. Patients with a history of biphasic reactions, severe reactions, beta-blocker use, older, those who live alone, or those with poor access to health care or deemed at risk should be monitored longer. Along with the prescription for an epinephrine pen, antihistamines and corticosteroids are
