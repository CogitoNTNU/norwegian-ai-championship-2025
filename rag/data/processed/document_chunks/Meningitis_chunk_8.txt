the spread of highly infectious agents. Strict isolation protocols, often involving droplet precautions, and frequent hand washing are crucial to controlling the transmission of viral meningitis and many other infectious causes. Special attention, especially after diaper changes in children, is necessary to prevent the spread of enterovirus infections.[2][7] Proper hand hygiene is essential, and isolation measures should be implemented based on the suspected cause of the infection. Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure, with vaccines available for those at risk of polio, mumps, measles, mumps varicella, and rubella. These vaccines should be administered according to the recommended vaccine schedule. Additionally, arboviral vaccines are available as a precautionary measure for populations residing in or traveling to endemic areas.[2][8][7] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes In managing aseptic meningitis, a team-based approach is essential. Physicians diagnose the condition based on clinical symptoms and lab results, determining appropriate treatment strategies, medications, and hospitalization when necessary. Effective communication with patients and their families is crucial to ensure they comprehend the diagnosis, treatment plan, and expectations. In managing aseptic meningitis, the primary focus is supportive care, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate medical treatment. Specialists in fields such as infectious disease and neurology can be involved, especially in cases where the patient exhibits severe neurological symptoms and complications or requires specialized assessments. An oncologist may also be helpful if meningitis is due to malignancy. Because meningitis represents a dangerous infectious disease, communication with all levels of the staff is essential. Ensuring the proper isolation measures and using personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of the infection to the medical team or other patients is paramount and should be of primary concern. Once the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis is established and more concerning diagnoses are excluded, these precautions can be discontinued.[2][7] An LP is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and can be conducted by an emergency medicine clinician, an internist on an inpatient floor, or an interventional radiologist. Laboratory proficiency is essential to analyze specimens and conduct PCR studies, aiding in identifying the most common etiology, typically viruses. Unfortunately, these studies are still underutilized.[2][4][7] Nurses closely monitor patients, observing vital signs and neurological status, which is crucial for early detection of complications or deterioration. Pharmacists collaborate with healthcare providers to ensure appropriate dosages, interactions, and compatibility of medications prescribed for aseptic meningitis. Regular interprofessional team meetings facilitate discussions about patient progress, adjustments to the treatment plan, and
