Hemostasis involves an interplay of clotting factors and the vessel wall. Abnormalities of the vessel wall and the clotting factors result in the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin leading to clot formation (coagulation). Different anticoagulant options exist, and providers make expert decisions on which anticoagulant to use based on the indication, patient preference, the efficacy of individual anticoagulants in specific clinical settings, and the general treatment guidelines. This activity reviews different anticoagulation therapies, their indications, contraindications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients requiring anticoagulation. **Objectives:** - Review the principles of anticoagulation with a brief description of the clotting cascade. - Describe different anticoagulation therapies and their clinical indications. - Identify different modalities used in the reversal of anticoagulation. - Summarize the interprofessional strategies in improving care for patients requiring anticoagulation.

It is divided into four stages. The first stage involves the creation of a platelet plug consequent from disruption of the vascular endothelium from injuries due to diabetes, hypertension, smoking as well as vascular wall tear. Following damage to the vascular wall, the Von Willibrand factor (VWF) is released by the endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, which mediates platelet adhesion to the damaged vascular surface, and aggregation of platelets. The second stage involves the propagation of clots by activation of various proenzymes to their active form.[1] This clotting cascade is a regulatory process of the clotting system initiated by the extrinsic pathway and propagated via the intrinsic pathway.[1] The extrinsic pathway is initiated by factor 3 (tissue factor), a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is present in the subendothelial tissues and fibroblast. Tissue factor is activated by exposure from vascular disruption or damage. Exposed tissue factor binds to factor 7 and calcium, which then converts factor 10 to activated factor 10.[2] The intrinsic pathway results from activation of factor 11 by factor 12, HMW Kininogen, and
