However, due to the nonspecific nature of these symptoms, distinguishing asthma from other respiratory illnesses can sometimes be challenging. A confirmed diagnosis of asthma relies on consistent respiratory symptoms and the identification of variable expiratory airflow obstruction documented on spirometry. Clinicians prioritize symptom control and prevention of future exacerbations through tailored treatment, considering symptom frequency, severity, and potential risks in a step-wise approach. Early recognition and intervention of asthma exacerbations are crucial to prevent the progression of asthma to severe, life-threatening stages. Fatalities related to asthma highlight missed opportunities in recognizing disease severity and escalating therapy, emphasizing the critical role of continual patient education and routine symptom control assessment for successful long-term management. The development of asthma, often presenting in childhood, involves a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors associated with atopy. Researchers strive to develop predictive systems for identifying individuals at risk of continued symptoms into adulthood. Despite significant advancements in understanding the underlying genetic loci, environmental triggers, and risk factors, clinical strategies remain lacking to mitigate the risks of persistent asthma development into adolescence and adulthood. This activity covers the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and assessment of asthma, along with initiating pharmacological treatment and developing monitoring strategies tailored for adolescents and adults. These strategies closely align with evidence-based recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma. **Objectives:** - Identify the hallmark symptoms of asthma, including dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. - Implement evidence-based treatment strategies for asthma management, considering individual patient characteristics and preferences. - Assess asthma severity, control, and exacerbation risk regularly during follow-up visits. - Collaborate with interdisciplinary healthcare team members to optimize asthma care and patient outcomes.

This respiratory condition is characterized by inflammation of the airways, causing intermittent airflow obstruction and
