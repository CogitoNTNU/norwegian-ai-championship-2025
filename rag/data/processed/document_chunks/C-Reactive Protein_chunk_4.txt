patients. Clinicians can use these values to monitor disease progression, guide treatment strategies, and identify potential complications. ## Interfering Factors Certain pharmacological agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins, can reduce CRP levels. Recent injury or illness may elevate levels, particularly when using the test for cardiac risk stratification. Magnesium supplementation can diminish CRP levels. Emerging pharmacological agents, including biologics like the interleukin 6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab, have demonstrated efficacy in lowering CRP levels in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.[20] Additionally, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, have been associated with reductions in CRP levels, reflecting their anti-inflammatory properties.[21] Sustained reductions in CRP levels have also been associated with lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, improved sleep quality, stress reduction strategies, and adherence to anti-inflammatory dietary patterns.[22] Genetic polymorphisms within the CRP gene, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region, can influence baseline CRP levels. These genetic variations may account for individual differences in CRP concentrations and should be considered when interpreting results.[23] Mild CRP elevations may occur in the absence of overt systemic inflammation. Levels tend to be higher in women and older adults. Chronic conditions, such as obesity, smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and insomnia, are associated with low-grade inflammation and can elevate CRP, requiring cautious interpretation in these contexts. Mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, have been explored in relation to CRP levels. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, including medical, social, and demographic factors such as sex, age, and race, these associations tend to weaken, suggesting indirect rather than causal relationships.[24] ## Complications Given the highly variable causes of CRP elevation, marginal increases can be difficult to interpret and should not be used as an isolated test result without considering the clinical context. Extremely high levels are helpful in distinguishing between infection and inflammation, but levels between 1 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL present challenges in interpretation. Chronic conditions, such as inflammatory arthritis or SLE, can cause persistently elevated CRP levels, complicating the use of hsCRP as a predictive marker for cardiovascular disease. CRP acts as a nonspecific indicator of inflammation, and its levels are influenced by factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Therefore, CRP results should be interpreted within the broader clinical context and, when necessary, complemented with other diagnostic tests to enhance accuracy. ## Patient Safety and Education Patients should be informed
