fourth episode. A proposed explanation is that alcoholic pancreatitis is more likely to recur than biliary pancreatitis, which typically occurs only once. Continued alcohol consumption contributes to progressive pancreatic damage. In addition, each recurrent episode causes further injury to an already compromised pancreas. By the third episode and beyond, acute pancreatitis tends to be more severe than the initial occurrences. Individuals with 3 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis often exhibit clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis.[18] A conceptual model outlining the progression of chronic pancreatitis has been published.[3] The model describes the following distinct stages: - At risk: Individuals are asymptomatic before the first pancreatic injury. - Acute pancreatitis to recurrent acute pancreatitis: The first (sentinel) episode of acute pancreatitis occurs, followed by recurrent acute pancreatitis. - Early chronic pancreatitis: Biomarkers of chronic pancreatitis become detectable. At this stage, the condition may either resolve or progress if further injury or stress occurs. - Established chronic pancreatitis to end-stage chronic pancreatitis: Disease features worsen unless therapeutic intervention leads to resolution. Key pathological changes include: - Immune dysregulation leading to fibrosis or sclerosis - Acinar cell dysfunction leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Islet cell dysfunction leading to pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3c) - Characteristic pain leading to chronic pain syndrome - Metaplasia leading to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ## Histopathology Histopathological examination of chronic pancreatitis reveals a significant increase in connective tissue surrounding the lobules and ducts. The acinar architecture is often distorted, with fibrosis becoming more prominent in later stages. Precipitated protein deposits may also be observed in the ducts. Distortion of the ductal system can produce a characteristic chain of lakes on computed tomography (CT) scans. Pathologic fibrosis alone cannot serve as a definitive criterion for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. Variations in histological presentation across different etiologies, along with the possibility of minimal or absent fibrosis in late-stage disease when biopsies are typically performed, limit its diagnostic reliability.[19][20] The histopathology of SPINK1-associated chronic pancreatitis closely resembles that of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis, showing a loss of exocrine parenchyma replaced by fibrosis.[21] In contrast, progressive lipomatous atrophy of the pancreas is observed with PRSS1-associated hereditary chronic pancreatitis, CFTR mutations, and hypertriglyceridemic chronic pancreatitis.[22] ## History and Physical Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with prolonged abdominal pain, often with intermittent pain-free periods. The pain may improve when leaning forward. However, some patients remain asymptomatic. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea
