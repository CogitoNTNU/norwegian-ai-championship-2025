Vericiguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that stimulates the intracellular receptor for endogenous nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. It also improves cardiac contractility.[46][47] - Device therapy - ``` * An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with HF who have an LVEF of ≤35% and an NYHA functional class of II to III while on goal-directed medical therapy. An ICD is also indicated if a patient has NYHA functional class I and an EF of ≤30% on adequate medical therapy. ``` - Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing is recommended in patients with HFrEF and an NYHA functional class of II to III or ambulatory class IV with an LVEF ≤35%, QRS duration ≥150 ms, and sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology. It can also be considered in non-LBBB morphology and QRS ≥150 ms. - Revascularization is indicated in selected patients with coronary artery disease and HFrEF while on GDMT. - Valvular heart disease interventions such as transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair or mitral valve surgery might be beneficial for patients with HF and on GDMT. **Stage D Heart Failure Management** The recommended treatment for stage D (advanced HF) includes: - Referral to an HF specialist is indicated. - It is reasonable to utilize inotropic support and device therapy in patients awaiting mechanical cardiac support or transplants. Inotropic support alone can be used in patients not eligible for a transplant or mechanical cardiac support. - Mechanical cardiac support, eg, a durable left ventricle assist device (LVAD) or ECMO, can be beneficial as a bridge to transplant. - For highly selected patients, cardiac transplant is indicated to improve survival and quality of life. - Shared decision-making should determine the goals of care. This includes considering comorbid conditions, frailty, and socio-economic support. Palliative care should be offered as indicated after shared decision-making. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses for HF include: - Valvular heart diseases - Renal failure - Acute respiratory distress - Pulmonary fibrosis - Nephrotic syndrome - Pulmonary embolism - Pericardial diseases - Cirrhosis ## Staging The ACC/AHA stages of HF are as follows: - **Stage A** : At risk for HF. No current or past symptoms, structural heart disease, or evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers, but risk factors are present. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxic medications, or having a genetic variant for cardiomyopathy. -
