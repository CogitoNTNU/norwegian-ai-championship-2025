SBO, especially when the obstruction is resolved nonoperatively or via uncomplicated surgery. In cases of malignant obstruction, survival is dictated by the stage and progression of the underlying malignancy, often requiring a palliative approach. ## Complications SBO can lead to a range of complications, many of which are life-threatening if not promptly recognized and managed. These complications arise from the mechanical disruption of intestinal flow, vascular compromise, or secondary systemic effects. **Mechanical and Local Complications** - Bowel ischemia and strangulation - Increased intraluminal pressure compromises venous return, leading to bowel wall edema and, eventually, arterial ischemia. Strangulation occurs in approximately 25% of cases, particularly in closed-loop obstructions or hernias, and may result in necrosis, perforation, and gangrene.[38] - Perforation and peritonitis - Persistent ischemia or bowel necrosis can lead to perforation, spilling luminal contents into the peritoneal cavity and causing bacterial peritonitis. This is a surgical emergency with a high mortality risk. - Adhesion formation - Surgical or inflammatory causes of SBO may result in further adhesion formation, increasing the risk of recurrent obstructions. - Fistula formation - Chronic obstructions or associated diseases, such as Crohn disease, can lead to abnormal connections between bowel loops or other organs, complicating management. **Systemic Complications** - Sepsis and multiorgan failure - Bacterial translocation across ischemic or necrotic bowel walls can lead to bacteremia, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction. - Electrolyte imbalance and dehydration - Fluid sequestration within the bowel and vomiting lead to significant fluid and electrolyte losses, causing hypovolemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or acidosis (with bowel ischemia or necrosis). - Malnutrition - Prolonged obstruction, especially in chronic or partial cases, can result in malabsorption, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. **Postsurgical Complications** - **Anastomotic leak** - In cases requiring bowel resection, anastomotic leaks may occur, leading to peritonitis or abscess formation. - **Wound infection and dehiscence** - Postoperative infections and delayed wound healing are common complications following surgical intervention for SBO. **Palliative Complications** In patients managed palliatively for malignancy-related SBO, complications may include recurrent obstruction, inadequate symptom relief, and device-related issues such as stoma malfunction or infection. ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Attention is given to ongoing correction of fluid and electrolytes, as well as intestinal decompression, until adequate bowel function returns during the postoperative period. Patients are monitored clinically for complications relating to the surgical intervention and with laboratory and radiology as needed. Contrast imaging may be used if there is
