blister but can be painful. They usually self-resolve within 1 week. **Partial Thickness (second-degree):** Involve the epidermal layer and parts of the dermal layer. Superficial partial-thickness blisters are painful but resolve within 21 days and usually do not cause scarring. Deep partial-thickness burns always blister and cause damage to hair follicles and glandular tissue. Deep partial-thickness burns are extremely painful. These burns can get infected and may need to be grafted depending on the extent of the injury. These injuries take up to 9 weeks to heal and form hypertrophic scarring. **Full Thickness (third-degree):** These burns go through the dermal layer and frequently injure subcutaneous tissue. Burn eschars, or the denatured dermal layer, is intact acutely. The wound may be anesthetic due to the necrotic nature of the burn. The appearance can be waxy or grey to black. The eschar of the burn eventually falls off, revealing a bed of granulation tissue. If a full-thickness burn does not undergo surgery, it is healed by contracture. These burns never spontaneously heal. See **Image.** Thermal Burn, Third Degree. **Extension into deep tissues (fourth-degree):** These burns involve the underlying soft tissue, which may include muscle or bone. These injuries may be life-threatening and need to be treated immediately. ## Indications HBO is indicated for burns that extend into the dermis and beyond. Each case may vary, but if a patient has an inhalation injury, impaired wound healing, extensive edema, or a large area of skin involved, HBO therapy would be a good adjunctive therapy to add. If a patient has received a skin graft or flap, HBO has been shown to improve the success of graft placement.[6] ## Technique or Treatment If used, HBO treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the injury. Three treatments in the first 24 hours are suggested, and twice daily after that. Sessions are 90 minutes long at 2.0 ATA to 2.4 ATA and should be continued for 20 to 30 sessions, although the number of treatments depends on the clinical extent of the injury and response to treatment. Patients are monitored in the chamber with blood pressure (BP) cuffs approved to use in monoplace chambers. Ventilator support may be given in the chamber, which is common in patients who sustained an inhalation injury. Fluid management is crucial in burn patients and needs to be initiated before HBO therapy is started. Several liters of fluid may
