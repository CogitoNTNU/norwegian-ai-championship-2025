despite antimicrobial therapy.[4] ## Etiology PAM is caused by _Naegleria fowleri,_ a thermophilic, free-living ameba that lives in temperatures above 30 °C and can tolerate temperatures up to 45 °C. This protozoan parasite is found in the soil and freshwaters, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, hot springs, and unchlorinated swimming pools. Risk factors for infection include swimming, diving, waterskiing, surfing, and exposure to hot springs. The use of tap water for nasal irrigation has also been reported as a risk factor for the disease.[1][3] GAE is a subacute to chronic infection of the CNS caused by _Acanthamoeba_ species such as _A.culbertsoni, A polyphagia, A castellani, A astronyxis, A hatchetti, A rhysodes, A divionensis, A lugdunensis, A lenticulata,_ and _A haely, and_ _B mandrillaris_. _Acanthamoeba_ is found in soil as well as brackish water, sewage, and humidifiers.[1][3] ## Epidemiology PAM and GAE are very rare disease processes, with only 3.7 cases reported per year worldwide. PAM is more common in warmer regions, such as the southern part of the United States, and generally occurs in the warmer months of spring and summer, possibly due to the increased likelihood of participation in waterborne activities. The mean age of patients affected by PAM was 12 years (ranging from 8 months to 66 years); 79% were males.[5][6][7][8] ## Pathophysiology PAM occurs in healthy young individuals exposed to warm freshwater. _Naegleria fowleri_ infects susceptible individuals when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Trophozoites penetrate the olfactory mucosa, cross the cribriform plates, and ultimately reach the olfactory bulb and cause the inflammatory reaction and the parenchymal damage associated with PAM.[7] GAE occurs when the infective form of Acanthamoeba, the trophozoites, enters the body through the eyes, nasal passages, and respiratory tract or ulcerated skin. Once it gains entry, the parasite invades the central nervous system by hematogenous dissemination resulting in GAE. Once in the central nervous system, the parasite stimulates abscess and focal granuloma formation. Disseminated disease, skin disease, and keratitis can also occur.[9] ## Histopathology _Naegleria fowleri_ has a 3 stage life cycle: amoeboid trophozoites, flagellate, and cysts. Hostile environmental changes can cause the trophozoites to change to the flagellated form, and the parasite will revert when conditions improve. _Naegleria fowleri_ trophozoites are found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue, and occasionally, flagellated forms may be noted in the CSF. Cysts are not seen in brain tissue.[1][3] On the contrary, _Acanthamoeba_ exists
