insulin might be recommended on their home dose if they had been well controlled. Insulin-naive patients should receive a multi-dose insulin regimen beginning at a dose of 0.5 to 0.8 U/kg/day. To prevent the recurrence of ketoacidosis in the transition period, insulin infusion should be continued for 2 hrs after the starting of subcutaneous insulin and check blood sugar and complete metabolic profile again before stopping the insulin drip. If the patient cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous insulin, and fluids may be continued. The use of long-acting insulin analogs during the initial management of DKA may facilitate the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin therapy.[34] **Electrolyte Replacement** **Potassium** Patients with DKA are often found to initially have mild to moderate hyperkalemia, despite a total body deficit of potassium. The initiation of insulin causes an intracellular shift of potassium and lowers the potassium concentration, potentially resulting in severe hypokalemia.[35][36] Hence patients with serum potassium levels of less than 3.3 mmol/L need initial management with fluid resuscitation and potassium replacement while delaying commencement of insulin until after potassium levels are above 3.3 mmol/L, to avoid cardiac arrhythmias, arrest, and respiratory muscle weakness.[34] In other patients, potassium replacement should be started when the serum concentration is less than 5.2 mEq/L to maintain a level of 4 to 5 mEq/L. The administration of 20 to 30 mEq of potassium per liter of fluids is sufficient for most patients; however, lower doses are required for patients with acute or chronic renal failure.[37] **Magnesium** Hypokalemia is commonly associated with hypomagnesemia. Repletion of both potassium and magnesium may need to be done, and it may be difficult to improve potassium levels until magnesium levels are repleted. **Bicarbonate** Bicarbonate replacement does not appear to be beneficial. In one study, the difference in time to resolution of acidosis (8 hours vs. 8 hours; p = 0.7) and time to hospital discharge (68 hours vs. 61 hours; p = 0.3) was found to be statistically insignificant between patients who received intravenous bicarbonate (n = 44) compared with those who did not (n = 42).[38] In another pediatric study, children with diabetic ketoacidosis who have low PaCO2 and high BUN concentrations at presentation and those treated with bicarbonate were at increased risk for cerebral edema.[39] Proposed pitfalls of the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in DKA may include paradoxical CSF acidosis, hypokalemia, large sodium bolus, and cerebral edema. However, it may
