normally drains into the duodenum at the minor papilla, and smaller branched ducts emerging from the main pancreatic duct. These ducts can become obstructed or genetically malformed. Chronic inflammation can lead to scarring and fibrosis, causing permanent damage that impairs secretory functions.[1][2] Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease affecting both pancreatic functions. Exocrine dysfunction leads to pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, and weight loss, occurring when over 90% of the organ is damaged. In severe cases, pancreatic insufficiency affects up to 85% of patients. Endocrine dysfunction results in pancreatogenic diabetes, also known as type 3c diabetes. In 2016, international pancreas societies adopted a mechanistic definition of chronic pancreatitis. This definition characterizes end-stage chronic pancreatitis as pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia, but also addresses the disease mechanism as a pathological fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress.[3] Chronic pancreatitis differs from acute pancreatitis, which presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain radiating to the back. Patients with chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic for long periods or may experience persistent abdominal pain requiring hospitalization. Histologically, acute pancreatitis is characterized by predominant neutrophilic infiltration, whereas chronic pancreatitis primarily involves mononuclear cell infiltration.[4][5][6] ## Etiology The TIGAR-O classification system (Toxic-metabolic, Idiopathic, Genetic, Autoimmune, Recurrent and severe acute pancreatitis, and Obstructive) categorizes the causes of chronic pancreatitis using the acronym TIGAR (see **Table.** Modified TIGAR-O Pancreatitis Risk/Etiology Checklist): [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK482325/table/article-26580.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK482325/table/article-26580.table0/?report=objectonly) Table 1.

Additional causes of chronic pancreatitis include deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants, and radiation therapy.[9][10] In adults, alcohol consumption is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, whereas in children, genetic conditions, especially cystic fibrosis, and anatomic variants are the primary causes (see **Table 2.** Genetic Polymorphisms Related to Chronic Pancreatitis). Alcohol increases protein secretion from acinar cells, producing more viscous pancreatic fluid. This hyperviscosity leads to ductal obstruction, acinar fibrosis, and atrophy. However, fewer than 10% of individuals with alcohol use disorder develop chronic pancreatitis, suggesting that other factors, such as smoking, may also contribute to its development.
