cost-effective. Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm, gallbladder wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid are indicative of cholecystitis (see **Image**. Acalculous Cholecystitis). **Additional Diagnostic Studies** The test of choice for diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of a normal ultrasound is a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, which may be done in conjunction with administration of CCK.[16] A HIDA scan evaluates the function or ejection fraction of the gallbladder. After the radionuclide is administered, CCK is given to stimulate gallbladder emptying. A calculated ejection fraction of â‰¤35% may be indicative of hypokinetic functioning of the gallbladder.[17] HIDA scan may also demonstrate no filling of the gallbladder with radiotracer material, indicative of cystic duct obstruction and acute cholecystitis.[6][18] Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen with intravenous contrast may also reveal gallbladder wall thickening, edema, and pericholecystic fluid in the absence of gallstones and sludge. ## Treatment / Management **Stabalization and Antibiotic Therapy** Patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis should receive appropriate fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics that provide coverage for gram-negative rods and anaerobes, ideally after blood cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics alone are usually ineffective as they inadequately penetrate the pressurized gallbladder.[5][19][20] Individuals requiring ICU-level care should be properly stabilized before undergoing operative intervention. **Percutaneous Cholecystostomy Tube and Stent Placement** In those patients who are too unstable to undergo surgery, clinicians should consider interventional radiology consultation for percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.[21] Percutaneous drainage is often the definitive treatment because acute acalculous cholecystitis has a lower recurrence rate when compared to acute calculous cholecystitis. The cholecystostomy tube can be removed after 3 weeks.[22] After percutaneous drainage and recovery, outpatient tube studies by interventional radiology can confirm patency of the cystic duct before removal. Alternatively, the patient can undergo cholecystectomy between 4 and 8 weeks after tube placement.[23] Another treatment option is cystic duct stent placement via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to decompress the gallbladder and prevent cystic duct obstruction.[24] However, this approach is not as widely available as percutaneous cholecystostomy, and outcomes have not been studied as extensively. **Surgical Management** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred definitive approach. However, an open cholecystectomy can also be performed if a contraindication to a minimally invasive approach is identified. Acute acalculous cholecystitis must be addressed fairly urgently because rapid progression and deterioration may result if left untreated. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is treated similarly to chronic calculous cholecystitis with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A robotic approach should be considered
