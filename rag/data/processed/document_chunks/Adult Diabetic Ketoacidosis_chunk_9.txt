diabetic ketoacidosis who have low PaCO2 and high BUN concentrations at presentation and those treated with bicarbonate were at increased risk for cerebral edema.[39] Proposed pitfalls of the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in DKA may include paradoxical CSF acidosis, hypokalemia, large sodium bolus, and cerebral edema. However, it may be used in patients with severe acidemia. The most recent ADA guidelines do recommend the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in patients with pH less than 7.1.[38] **Phosphate** The role of phosphate replacement in DKA has been looked at in different studies. In one randomized study with 44 patients, phosphate therapy did not alter the duration of DKA, insulin dosage required to correct the acidosis, abnormal muscle enzyme levels, glucose disappearance, or morbidity and mortality. Although theoretically appealing, phosphate therapy is not an essential part of the treatment for DKA in most patients, an unusual case of severe hypophosphatemia (1.0 mg/dl) related seizure in a child with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been described in the literature.[40] **Laboratory Monitoring** - Hourly point-of-care testing (POCT) glucose should be performed - Serum glucose and electrolyte levels may need to be done every 2 hours until the patient is stable, then every 4 hours - Initial blood urea nitrogen (BUN) - Initial VBG or ABG monitoring, followed by as-needed precipitating events **Intubation** There are multiple risks associated with intubation in patients with DKA. Intubation should be avoided if at all possible. Treating as above with a focus on administering fluids and insulin will almost always lead to an improvement in acidosis and overall clinical presentation. Patients attempt to compensate for severe acidosis by creating a compensatory respiratory alkalosis that manifests via tachypnea and Kussmaul breathing. If patients are no longer able to generate respiratory alkalosis due to comatose state or severe fatigue, intubation should be considered. However, the risks of intubation in DKA include a rise in PaCO2 during sedation and/or paralysis, which can decrease pH further, increasing the risk of aspiration due to gastroparesis, and difficulty matching the degree of respiratory compensation once the patient is on a ventilator. If a patient is intubated and placed on a ventilator, it is essential to attempt to match the patient's minute ventilation such that respiratory alkalosis is created to compensate for the metabolic acidosis of DKA. If not, there will be worsening acidosis, which can ultimately lead to cardiac arrest. It is reasonable to start
