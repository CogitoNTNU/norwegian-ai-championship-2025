tamponade. ## Etiology The cause of pericarditis is mostly idiopathic, which makes up around 90% of cases. Other causes are infections caused by viruses, bacteria, or tuberculosis. Other causes could include neoplasms, a connective tissue disorder, renal failure, post-myocardial infarction (also known as Dressler syndrome), open heart surgery (also known as postpericardiotomy syndrome), and drugs, especially procainamide and hydralazine.[2] Cardiac tamponade may be caused by the accumulation of pericardial fluid from either a transudate, exudate, or blood. Slow accumulation, such as in infections such as tuberculosis or myocarditis, autoimmune diseases, neoplasms, uremia, and other inflammatory diseases are better tolerated than rapid accumulation, as seen in hemorrhages such as from a penetrating wound to the heart, ventricular wall rupture after myocardial infarction (MI) or following a pacemaker insertion complication.[5] ## Epidemiology Acute pericarditis was reported in 0.1% to 0.2% of hospitalized patients for non-ischemic chest pain.[2] The prevalence of pericardial effusions is difficult to estimate because a good deal of them may not be clinically significant. The incidence or prevalence of pericardial effusions is estimated to be around 2 cases per 10,000 population. There is an increased prevalence in HIV-positive patients, end-stage renal disease, occult malignancies, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or penetrating traumatic injury to the chest.[5] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiology includes infections, autoimmune processes (Dressler syndrome, postpericardiotomy syndrome), uremia, and connective tissue disorder. Most cases are idiopathic, thought to be caused by a triggering of the inflammatory process resulting in inflammation of the pericardium, which causes pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade results from the rapid filling of fluid within the pericardium, leading to compression of the chambers of the heart, further resulting in decreased venous return, ventricular filling, and decreased cardiac output. Pericarditis, autoimmune diseases, or neoplasms often result in slow-growing effusions that, over time, become large before leading to a cardiac tamponade type of picture.[5] ## History and Physical **Symptoms** Patients with pericarditis commonly present with sudden onset chest pain, which is pleuritic and classically improves when leaning forward and worsens when lying down. Patients with cardiac tamponade present with manifestations of cardiogenic or obstructive shock. They may endorse vague symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or, in more severe cases, dizziness, syncope, and altered mental status. They may also present in a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest. **Signs** The classic physical findings in cardiac tamponade are included in Beckâ€™s triad of hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled
