HbA1c levels.[5][6] ## Pathophysiology Regular A1c testing is essential for individuals with diabetes mellitus to ensure their average blood glucose levels are within the target range. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that individuals with diabetes mellitus who have stable blood sugar control and are meeting treatment goals should have their HbA1c (A1C) checked at least twice a year.[2] For individuals whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic targets, testing should be performed every 3 months. This approach helps optimize diabetes control and reduce the risk of complications.[7] ## Specimen Requirements and Procedure The HbA1c test can be performed as a point-of-care (POC) test, a STAT test, or by sending a sample to a laboratory. The POC test uses a STAT analyzer to measure A1c from a capillary fingerstick. The laboratory test uses a teaspoon of blood drawn from a venous sample into a K2 EDTA (lavender top) tube. The sample is processed as whole blood. Patients do not have to fast for the HbA1c test, as it reflects long-term blood sugar control rather than immediate glucose levels.[2] ## Diagnostic Tests The venous sample A1c test may be used as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice when determining diabetes risk or onset. Due to the variability of capillary POC testing, any A1c test conducted using a capillary sample should be confirmed with a venous sample before diagnosing. An HbA1c value below 5.7% is considered normal or non-diabetic. A value between 5.7% and 6.4% indicates prediabetes mellitus, whereas a 6.5% or higher level is diagnostic for diabetes mellitus. Tests should be sent to a laboratory certified by the NGSP to ensure standardized results.[8][9] ## Testing Procedures Numerous analytical techniques have been developed to quantify HbA1c, each offering specific advantages in precision and applicability. To ensure global consistency, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) established a reference system for HbA1c measurement. This system uses primary reference materials composed of purified HbA1c and HbA0, with 2 proposed reference methods—electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis.[10] These reference methods target the glycated N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin β-chain. The process involves enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C to release the N-terminal hexapeptide, followed by separation and quantification of glycated and non-glycated hexapeptides.[11] HbA1c is expressed as the ratio of glycated to total hexapeptides. A network of IFCC-designated reference laboratories maintains and supports this standardized framework, ensuring its reliability
