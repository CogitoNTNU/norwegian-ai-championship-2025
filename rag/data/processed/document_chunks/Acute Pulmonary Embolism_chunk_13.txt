out (\<500 ng/mL). CT pulmonary angiography should be performed if the D-dimer is positive (>500 ng/mL) in patients aged \<50 or higher after the age-adjusted D-dimer value. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, a V/Q scan should be performed. For a patient with an intermediate probability of PE (Wells score 2 to 6), measure D-dimer levels; if negative, PE can be excluded. If positive, then CTPA is done. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, a V/Q scan should be performed.[51] **High probability of pulmonary embolus (Wells score >6)** CTPA should be performed emergently in patients with a high likelihood of PE. Feasibility requires adequate scanner technology, and the patient must be able to lie flat, cooperate with exam breath-holding instructions, have a body habitus that can fit into the scanner, and have no contraindications for iodinated contrast. If the CTPA is inconclusive or not feasible, clinicians should perform a V/Q scan. A normal V/Q scan excludes PE. A PE may be diagnosed in patients with a V/Q scan demonstrating a high probability of PE. For a V/Q scan resulting in intermediate probability, further testing with lower extremity compression ultrasonography with Doppler is appropriate. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable and in whom definitive imaging is unsafe, bedside echocardiography or venous compression ultrasound may be used to obtain a presumptive diagnosis of PE to justify the administration of potentially life-saving therapies.[51] ## Treatment / Management **Initial Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolus** **Supportive measures** The initial approach to patients with PE should focus on supportive measures. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation \<90%. Mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but clinicians should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation. Acute right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over-distend the right ventricular, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output. Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC)/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors may be needed for hemodynamic support. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with PEs. **Anticoagulation** Remembering that anticoagulation is the mainstay of treating acute PE is vital. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; fondaparinux) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and
