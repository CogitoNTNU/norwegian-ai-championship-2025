FES.[3][4][5] Gurd et al in 1970 and later Wilson in 1974 put forward the following diagnostic criteria: 2 major criteria or at least one major criteria and 4 minor criteria. **Major Criteria** - Petechial rash - Respiratory insufficiency - Cerebral involvement in non-head injury patients **Minor Criteria** - Fever greater than 38.5 C - Tachycardia heart rate greater than 110 beats per minute - Retinal involvement - Jaundice - Renal signs - Anemia - Thrombocytopenia - High erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Fat macroglobulinemia **Schoenfeld Criteria** Another report by Schoenfeld et al proposed a quantitative means for diagnosing FES. A cumulative score greater than 5 is required for the diagnosis. - 5 points - petechiae rash - 4 points - diffuse infiltrate on x-ray - 3 points - hypoxemia - 1 point (for each) - fever, tachycardia, confusion **Lindeque Criteria** Lastly, Lindegue et al suggested using respiratory symptoms alone as the diagnostic criteria for FES. This criterion has not gained worldwide acceptance compared to the Gurd, Wilson, and Schoenfeld criteria. - Sustained Pa02 less than 8 kilopascal - Sustained PC02 greater than 7.3 kilopascal - Sustained respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute despite sedation - Dyspnea, increased work of breathing, anxiety, tachycardia **Ancillary Studies** Apart from the aforementioned diagnostic criteria, other ancillary studies are needed to aid in the diagnostic workup, including the following: \*\*_Complete blood count_ \*\* Anemia and thrombocytopenia are very common in FES. \*\*_Comprehensive metabolic panel_ \*\* Metabolic acidosis, increased levels of BUN, and creatinine can be seen in patients with FES. \*\*_Arterial blood gas_ \*\* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch is a hallmark of FES. The arterial blood gas analysis usually has a low partial pressure of oxygen, causing hypoxemia. An increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient is common in FES. The A-a gradient is the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolus and the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. In FES, the pulmonary blood vessels are occluded, causing perfusion impairment with normal ventilation. The result of this in FES is a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. To calculate the A-a gradient, use the formula: **A-a gradient = PA02 - Pa02** - Pa02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery - PA02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar sac To calculate the PAO2 and Pa02 - PAO2 = FiO2 (P atmospheric - P water vapor) â€“ (PCO2/R). - PaO2 = partial
