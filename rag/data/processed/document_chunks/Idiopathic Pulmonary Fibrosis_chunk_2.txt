T-helper 2 inflammatory response and type 2 cytokines are part of the adaptive immunity responsible for IPF pathogenesis. Together, these processes increase pro-fibrotic factors such as interleukins (IL) 9 and 13, as well as transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î². Dendritic cells also help propagate ongoing inflammation.[8] In addition, inflammation is believed to trigger the activation of alveolar epithelial cells, ultimately leading to the accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, thereby promoting excessive extracellular matrix deposition.[9] The initial insults for inflammation are often related to exposure to cigarette smoke and air pollution. Aging is a primary risk factor for IPF, as with aging, the supply of protective stem cells and pericytes becomes depleted, likely making individuals more susceptible to fibroblast activation and proliferation.[9] Furthermore, several recent studies have reported an association between thyroid dysfunction and fibrosis in various organs, including the lungs.[10] This association indicates a potential role in the pathogenesis of IPF and the development of chronic fibrosis. **Genetic Mutations** IPF involves several genes crucial in lung development and the response to environmental injury, including _WNT_ , _TGF_ , _Notch_ , and sonic hedgehog (_SHH_). In addition, genes involved in the inflammatory process are also involved, and some of these include the Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) and the inhibitory protein of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.[8][9] Although most cases of IPF are idiopathic, some genetic factors that contribute to familial cases have been identified. Mutations in the telomerase genes (such as _TERT_), surfactant genes (such as _SFTPA2_), and mucin genes (such as _MUC5B_) have been known to lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is another rare autosomal recessive condition with defects in lysosome-related organelles that lead to albinism, platelet defects, and pulmonary fibrosis in many of the affected individuals (see **Image.** Putative Mechanisms of IPF).[11][12] ## Epidemiology IPF usually presents after the fifth or sixth decade of life and is more prevalent in older individuals. Research studies indicate a higher prevalence of IPF in males compared to females.[13] In Europe and North America, estimated IPF prevalence rates range from 0.33 to 2.51 and 2.40 to 2.98 per 10,000 people, respectively.[13] Data from a comprehensive database in the United States revealed a standardized incidence of 14.6 cases per 100,000 person-years, with a prevalence of 58.7 cases per 100,000 individuals during the study period.[14] The prevalence of IPF typically rises with age, with the majority of patients aged 50 or older and up to 85%
