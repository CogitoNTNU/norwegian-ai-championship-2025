Since its introduction to clinical practice by Shigeto Ikeda in 1966, flexible bronchoscopy has become an essential tool in diagnosis and management of patients with lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy can be particularly helpful in therapeutic cases. This activity describes the indications, contraindications of bronchoscopy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with airway disorders. **Objectives:** - Describe the technique of flexible and rigid bronchoscopy. - Review the indications for bronchoscopy. - Summarize the contraindications of bronchoscopy. - Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing bronchoscopy.

[1][2]Since its introduction to clinical practice by Shigeto Ikeda in 1966, flexible bronchoscopy has become an essential tool in diagnosis and management of patients with lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy can be particularly helpful in therapeutic cases. ## Anatomy and Physiology A flexible bronchoscope, equipped with fiber optics, camera, and light source, allows for real-time, direct visualization of the airways. [3][4]It can be used to examine the respiratory tract starting from the oral or nasal cavity to the sub-segmental bronchi. Advanced bronchoscopic techniques such as endobronchial ultrasound enable ultrasonographic evaluation of mediastinal structures such as lymph nodes, as well as the periphery of the lung. ## Indications **Diagnostic Indications** Hemoptysis, chronic unexplained cough, stridor, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, nodal staging of lung cancer, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, atelectasis, suspected tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and post lung transplant surveillance.[3][5] **Therapeutic Indications** Foreign body retrieval, tracheal and bronchial stent placement balloon dilatation of airway stenosis, ablation or debulking of endobronchial tumors, management of persistent air leak or bronchopleural fistula, difficult intubations, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction surgery, bronchial thermoplasty for asthma, whole lung lavage, and as an adjunct during percutaneous tracheotomy.[6] Bronchoscopy is a good temporizing modality for hemoptysis by isolating the bleeding
