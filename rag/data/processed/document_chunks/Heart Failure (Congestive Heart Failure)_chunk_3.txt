commonly affected. Women are more likely to experience mitral valve rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse, while men are more likely to suffer from aortic valve diseases such as regurgitation or stenosis. Endocarditis is also more common in men. **Hypertension** Hypertension causes HF even in the absence of CAD or ischemic heart disease. High blood pressure causes mechanical stress by increased afterload and neurohormonal changes that increase ventricular mass.[3] Hypertension is also strongly associated with other comorbidities for HF development, and aggressively treating hypertension is shown to lower the incidence of HF.[3] **Cardiomyopathy** Cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by enlarged ventricles with impaired function not related to secondary causes such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, or congenital heart disease. The most common types of cardiomyopathies are hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and left ventricular noncompaction.[6] In addition to CHF, cardiomyopathy can present as arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, further compelling the identification of underlying disorders. Many of these conditions have a genetic basis, and a detailed family history of sudden cardiac death, especially in first-degree relatives older than 35 years, should be taken. Over 50 identified genes contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy alone. Genetic determinants have variable phenotypic expression, and many nongenetic factors also affect the clinical symptoms. Some of these factors include diabetes, toxic exposure, or pregnancy. Fabry disease is a rare glycogen storage disease that can cause CHF symptoms through a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pattern.[3][6] **Inflammatory cardiomyopathy** Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis along with ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. The most common cause is viral infection. Other etiologies are bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infections; toxic substances or drugs; and immune-mediated diseases. Chagas disease is caused by _Trypanosoma cruzi,_ which is endemic in Latin America \_\_ and commonly causes myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and CHF. Other viral causes of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy include adenoviruses, enteroviruses, herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Viruses can also activate autoimmune myocarditis, including HIV, hepatitis C virus, influenzas A and B, and coronaviruses (including COVID-19). When associated with CHF, these conditions tend to have a poor prognosis.[7] **Infiltrative cardiomyopathies** Infiltrative cardiomyopathies cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern (similar to the genetically determined restrictive cardiomyopathy variant), which is notable for normal ventricular systolic function but with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling dynamics. This is often associated with a high
