The systemic complications associated with rhabdomyolysis result from the leakage of muscle intracellular components into the bloodstream, particularly myoglobin. The etiology of rhabdomyolysis can be classified into traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Patients with traumatic rhabdomyolysis are also at risk for complications like compartment syndrome. The evaluation relies largely on levels of creatinine phosphate kinase, and muscle biopsy is indicated when underlying inherited conditions leading to myopathy are suspected. Early treatment with hydration and alkalinazation of urine is key for preventing kidney injury. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of rhabdomyolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Identify the potential etiologies of rhabdomyolysis based on clinical history. - Assess patients for associated complications of rhabdomyolysis, including acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome. - Implement appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients with rhabdomyolysis. - Collaborate amongst an interprofessional team regarding strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with rhabdomyolysis.

The word rhabdomyolysis is derived from the Greek words _rhabdos_ (rod-like/striated), _mys_ (muscle), and _lysin_ (release).[1] The most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are crush injuries secondary to trauma or immobilization, extreme physical exertion, metabolic myopathies, viral illness, and electrolyte disorders.[2] The common symptoms and signs are muscle weakness, pain, myalgias, and local swelling. Rhabdomyolysis may be associated with dark reddish-colored urine due to myoglobinuria. Clinically, rhabdomyolysis can range from mild elevation in creatinine phosphokinase to medical emergencies like compartment syndrome, intravascular fluid depletion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pigment-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), and cardiac arrhythmias. Laboratory diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is based on elevations of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK), the most sensitive laboratory evaluation of muscle injury; there is no specific established
