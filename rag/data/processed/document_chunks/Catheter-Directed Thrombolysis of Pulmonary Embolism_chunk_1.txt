and outcomes in acute pulmonary embolism management.

This broad spectrum highlights the importance of accurately assessing pulmonary embolism severity from the outset. Given this diversity, it is critical to stratify patients based on their pulmonary embolism-related risk to tailor treatment approaches effectively. While anticoagulation therapy generally suffices for patients at low risk of complications, the benefits of active thrombus removal, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), become increasingly evident with the severity of pulmonary embolism.[3] CDT has emerged as a nuanced treatment option, particularly for patients with intermediate to high-risk pulmonary embolism. This intervention aims to reduce the thrombus burden in the pulmonary arteries, potentially improving right ventricular function and patient outcomes[4]. However, the application of CDT is not without risks, as the potential for bleeding and other complications must be weighed against the therapeutic benefits.[5] The landscape of interventional therapies for pulmonary embolism is evolving, with new devices and techniques being developed and approved for clinical use. This dynamic field necessitates a clear understanding of the current state of endovascular interventions and the development of evidence to guide their application in various clinical scenarios. ## Anatomy and Physiology Pulmonary embolisms usually originate from the deep veins or pelvis of the lower extremities. Dislodgement of a deep vein thrombosis can cause the blood clot to travel up the venous system through the right heart and become lodged in the pulmonary vasculature. Common locations for a pulmonary embolism to lodge include the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary artery, and segmental or subsegmental branches. Once lodged in the pulmonary vasculature, the blockage may result in hemodynamic heart strain and a decrease in blood supply to the downstream pulmonary parenchyma, depending on the size and location of the pulmonary embolism. This obstruction can lead to right ventricular failure due to acute pressure overload, which is a significant cause of mortality in severe pulmonary embolism cases. Obstruction of over 30% to 50% of the pulmonary arterial bed's cross-sectional area leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure.[6] Pulmonary embolism-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by thromboxane A2 and serotonin release, increases pulmonary vascular resistance and decreases arterial compliance.[7]
