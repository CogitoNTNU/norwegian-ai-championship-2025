EEG abnormalities, improvement of the seizure control, amelioration of the behavioral abnormalities, and reversal of cognitive regression—must be established at the time of the diagnosis. The existing treatment paradigm has its basis in uncontrolled studies and case series and primarily focuses on the use of traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including benzodiazepines and corticosteroids, epilepsy surgery, and other nonpharmacologic therapies such as the administration of IVIG or a ketogenic diet. The most common AEDs used for ESES include valproate, ethosuximide, and levetiracetam.[16] In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, researchers noted that levetiracetam decreased the spike-wave index to 37 (mean) from a baseline of 56 (mean) at the end of the treatment period (_P_ < 0.0002).[17] Rarely, ethosuximide and sulthiame have been reported to improve ESES as a monotherapy, but as adjunctive and combination therapy, both have had extensive use. Although valproate has not been associated with worsening seizures in ESES, the definitive efficacy of this agent is unknown and should not be used as first-line therapy.[18] Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam and clobazam, have been extensively used when treating ESES. A group of researchers treated 29 children with ESES with oral high-dose diazepam (1 mg/kg; maximum of 40 mg) and noted a reduction of the spike-wave index from 76.7% to 40.8% within 24 hours. These patients received 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam for 3 weeks after the initial high dose before gradual tapering. Reversible side effects—sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, hypotonia, paradoxical aggravation—occurred in approximately one-quarter of patients.[19] Larrieu et al first described the utility of clobazam in 1986.[20] Only rare reports of precipitation of absence status in ESES have appeared associated with clobazam.[21] Caraballo et al demonstrated that clobazam was effective in 5 of 117 patients and in combination with other agents in 86 of 117 patients.[22] A few specific antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can worsen seizure control in ESES and require withdrawal in the presence of worsening drop or absence seizures.[23][24] Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone) have been utilized in different therapeutic regimens, both as long-term continuous therapy lasting for months or intermittent monthly high-dose treatment. Buzatu et al retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of a 21-month regimen of hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg/day during the first month, 4 mg/kg/day during the second month, 3 mg/kg/day during the third month, 2 mg/kg/day for next 9 months, and slow taper during remaining of the treatment period) in 44 patients with a
