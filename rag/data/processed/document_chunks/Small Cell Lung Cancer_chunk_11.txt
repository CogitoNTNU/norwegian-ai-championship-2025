pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph node sampling. The 5-year survival is 78% for IA and 53% for IB disease. In patients who do not have the pulmonary reserve to tolerate pneumonectomy or lobectomy, a more conservative approach with wedge resection or segmentectomy can be done. The disadvantage is a higher local recurrence rate, but survival is the same. Local postoperative radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcomes in stage I disease. **Stage II** The survival of stage IIA and IIB lung is 46% and 36%, respectively. The preferred treatment is surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. If the tumor has invaded the chest wall, then an en-bloc resection of the chest wall is recommended. Pancoast tumor is a unique tumor of stage II. It arises from the superior sulcus and is usually diagnosed at a higher stage, IIB or IIIA. The treatment of choice in cases of Pancoast tumor is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, usually with etoposide and cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy followed by resection. Overall survival is 44% to 54% depending on postsurgery presence or absence of microscopic disease in the resected specimen. **Stage III** This is the most heterogeneous group, consisting of a wide variety of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement. In stage IIIA disease with N1 lymph nodes, surgery with curative intent is the treatment of choice. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients are found to have an N2 disease at the time of resection. The current consensus is to perform surgery as planned, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. There is no agreement on treatment for patients with stage IIIA tumors with N2/N3 lymph nodes. If the patient has good performance status and no weigh-loss, then concurrent chemo-radiotherapy affords the best outcome. However, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is not as tolerated and can cause severe esophagitis. Sequential therapy is better tolerated. Survival is 40% to 45% in the first two years, but five-year survival is only 20%. T4 tumors are usually treated exclusively with chemoradiation. Surgery may be an option in T4 N0-1 tumors with carinal involvement. The operative mortality of carinal resection is 10% to 15%, and survival is approximately 20%. If a tumor is T4 due to ipsilateral nonprimary lobe nodules with no mediastinal involvement, then surgery alone renders five-year survival of 20% Stage IIIB tumors are treated the same way unresectable IIIA cancers are treated, with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. For a select few patients, post-induction chemo-radiotherapy,
