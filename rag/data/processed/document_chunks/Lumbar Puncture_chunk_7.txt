needle touches the nerve root. The pain should stop immediately after withdrawing the needle by 1 mm, and CSF should flow. If the pain does not subside even after removing for a few minutes, we recommend using a different approach. The CSF pressure measured in a lateral decubitus position ranges between 6-20 cm of H20 in adults and greater in patients with obesity up to 25 cm H2O. If the patient is not in the lateral place, adding the length of the needle to the pressure is needed. The opening pressure of > 25 is diagnostic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in an appropriate clinical scenario.[12] For the standard diagnostic LP, 8 to 15 ml of CSF in 4 transparent tubes is sufficient, and CSF in the last tube is ideal for the cytological examination [8]. By removing 15-20 ml CSF, patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension report immediate symptom improvement and is a safe and diagnostic approach. A dry tap is when the needle is within the spinal canal, but CSF does not flow. It occurs commonly with hospitalized old-age patients. It happens with epidural lipomatosis, arachnoiditis, and prior surgery, or severe spinal canal narrowing. Sometimes the CSF is too thick for the needle due to cells such as in infection or malignancy. The CSF is rechecked after asking patients to cough or performing Valsalva maneuvers. Tilting down the foot end of the table by 45 degrees after securing the patient can also be performed. A mild, short-duration suction with a 10 ml syringe may help obtain the CSF. If all attempts failed, CT-guided LP or cervical puncture could be performed.[11] ## Complications **Vasovagal syncope:** Patients can experience a hot feeling, the feeling of throwing up during the procedure, which is generally reversible after taking a short break. **Herniation:** Although it is highly uncommon to occur, post puncture uncal herniation is an essential and dangerous complication. CT or MRI of the head is recommended before lumbar puncture to rule out obstructive hydrocephalus. **Nerve injury:** LP can cause direct harm to the roots of the cauda equina. **Spinal cord injury:** LP needles can damage the conus, especially in low-lying conus or achondroplasia. It is best to consult neurology, neurosurgery in these patients. **Meningitis:** Proper techniques of disinfection avoid infection. **Headache:** Typically, 20 or 22G needles have a reported incidence of 2.2% for FGLP while varies between 20.5 to 26.4% under blind technique.[13]
