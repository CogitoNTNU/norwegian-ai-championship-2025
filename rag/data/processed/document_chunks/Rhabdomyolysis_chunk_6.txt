syndromes) or lack of myocyte intracellular ATP (medicines, electrolytes, hereditary and metabolic disorders, intense exercise, ischemia) results in intracellular sodium and calcium influx. Water is drawn into the cell along with sodium, causing cellular swelling and disruption of intracellular and membraneous structures. Excessive intracellular calcium leads to activation of actin-myosin crosslinkage, myofibrillar contraction, and depletion of ATP. Excessive intracellular calcium also activates calcium-dependent phospholipases and proteases, promoting cell membrane dissolution and disruption of ion channels. With reperfusion, leukocytes migrate into the damaged muscle and cause an increased number of cytokines, prostaglandins, and free radicals, causing further myolysis, necrosis of muscle fibers, and release of muscle breakdown products like potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase, phosphate, uric acid, and various organic acids into the bloodstream.[22] This leads to the complications of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. In rhabdomyolysis, hypocalcemia is observed initially, followed by hypercalcemia. This is because calcium first moves into the myocyte during injury, and then it leaks out into extracellular spaces after cell lysis. **Myoglobinuria** Myoglobin is a 19 kD, iron-containing heme protein found predominantly in the sarcoplasm of skeletal and cardiac muscles. Due to the heme moiety, myoglobin carries and stores oxygen in myocytes. Myoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin and can acquire oxygen from hemoglobin, transferring oxygen from the blood to the muscle tissues. Circulating myoglobin is mainly bound to haptoglobin and Î±2- immunoglobulin. However, circulating haptoglobin is saturated at serum myoglobin levels higher than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/dL, and the glomerulus filters the excess free myoglobin.[40] Although small amounts of myoglobin are normally filtered and quickly excreted by the kidneys, the large amount of myoglobin released in rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI.[41] **Acute Kidney Injury** The kidney is especially vulnerable to damage from rhabdomyolysis due to its high oxygen consumption and mitochondrial density. Once muscles are damaged, their contents are released, causing inflammation and fluid sequestration. The reduction in intravascular volume activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, further compromising renal blood flow. The sympathetic nervous system is also activated, releasing vasopressin, which worsens renal ischemia. The myoglobin released by damaged myocytes is a main contributor to renal injury. The kidney's filtering capacity becomes overwhelmed by excess myoglobin, which then deposits in renal tubules, causing renal toxicity. The myoglobin can also bind oxygen, increasing free radicals and lipid peroxidation, which causes further oxidative damage and renal vasoconstriction. Rhabdomyolysis also leads to increased uric acid production, and the acidosis facilitates
