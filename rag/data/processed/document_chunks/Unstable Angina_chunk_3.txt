in controlling symptoms, it is not shown to reduce major cardiovascular events compared with medical therapy.[7] Lifestyle modifications include regular exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation, which should be encouraged. Risk factor modification includes controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Medications for risk factor modification and to prevent disease progression include aspirin, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers.[6] Medical therapy can be used to control symptoms as well as help mitigate the risk of the progression of atherosclerosis and cardiac events.[6] Antianginal agents can be separated based on the mechanism of symptom relief in angina. In general, symptomatic control is achieved by way of decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption. As heart rate is the main influencer of oxygen consumption, most anginal events are initiated by an increase in heart rate.[1] Three classes of drugs used for angina reduce symptoms by way of heart rate reduction— beta-blockers, ivabradine, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and decreased ejection fraction. Another mechanism by which anginal symptoms can be treated is vascular smooth muscle relaxation. This leads to coronary artery dilatation, thereby increasing perfusion ability. The drugs that work on this mechanism are dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and nicorandil.[1] Another drug used for chronic stable angina is ranolazine\*\*,\*\* which inhibits the late sodium current in ventricular myocardial cells. This reduces diastolic contractile dysfunction.[8] Treatment for unstable angina is aimed at pain reduction, limiting damage to the myocardium, and decreasing morbidity and mortality. **Nitrates** - no mortality benefit, but used for chest pain relief. They cause vasodilation, which decreases preload and left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. They are contraindicated in cases of hypotension and previous use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors within the past 48 hours.[9] **Morphine** - no mortality benefit, used for pain relief when pain relief is not fully achieved by nitrates. It causes some vasodilation aside from analgesia. **Beta-blockers** - reduce mortality. They cause a decrease in heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand.[9] **Antiplatelet agents** - dual therapy with aspirin and either clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes— acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and stroke.[9][10] **Anticoagulants** - reduce mortality by decreasing re-infarction rates in combination with antiplatelet agents. Used intravenously for acute treatment.[9] **Anatomic assessment of coronary arteries/consideration of revascularization** -
