and accelerate disease progression. Similarly, smoking cessation is vital and essential, as smoking is known to worsen the condition over time. Intervention is not clearly indicated when ductal strictures or stones are present, but the patient remains asymptomatic. However, if these obstructions cause symptoms, therapeutic options such as endoscopic procedures, surgical intervention, or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may be considered. **Pain Management of Chronic Pancreatitis** Pain management in chronic pancreatitis involves medical, endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical interventions. When imaging reveals ductal obstruction due to strictures or stones, the initial treatment approach should include endoscopy therapy or, in the case of stones, ESWL. Surgical intervention may be necessary if these interventions are unsuccessful or technically unfeasible. However, if no obstruction is identified, a trial of medical therapy is the recommended first-line approach.[28] **Medical management:** The initial approach to pain management in chronic pancreatitis should prioritize non-opioid medications before considering opioids. First-line options include acetaminophen or paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregabalin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants. Opioids should be avoided whenever possible due to the risks of dependence or addiction, tolerance, and adverse effects. However, they may be considered when non-opioid treatments prove ineffective or inadequate. Opioids should be prescribed in combination with non-opioid agents, particularly gabapentin, and initiated with a milder opioid such as tramadol, which has fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be more effective when combined with pregabalin. Antioxidant combinations—including selenium, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, L-methionine, and sometimes α-tocopherol—have demonstrated some effectiveness in pain relief in early chronic pancreatitis based on small studies. However, variability in formulations and dosages across studies limits definitive conclusions. Despite this, antioxidant therapy is safe and remains an option for some patients.[29][30] Pancreatic enzyme supplementation, although expensive, has not been proven effective in relieving pain associated with chronic pancreatitis.[31] However, it may still be beneficial for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to improve nutrient absorption and digestion **Endoscopic management:** A celiac plexus block, involving the injection of a local anesthetic (typically bupivacaine), sometimes combined with a corticosteroid (typically triamcinolone), can be performed endoscopically using EUS or with CT guidance by a radiologist.[32] Pain relief from this procedure typically lasts 3 to 6 months and can be repeated as needed. Obstructing pancreatic stones can be extracted using a basket, whereas balloons are rarely effective except in children, who may have softer stones. If traditional extraction methods fail, ESWL, pancreatoscopy-assisted laser, or electrohydraulic lithotripsy
