a hook effect or gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, the laboratory should perform a dilution before testing. ## Interfering Factors There are multiple reasons why an hCG test—whether serum or urine—may yield a false result. Although rare, false-positive hCG tests can result in unnecessary medical care and irreversible surgical procedures.[6] False-negative results may be equally concerning and result in a delay in care or diagnostic evaluation. Potential causes of false results are outlined below. **False-Positive Serum hCG Results** - Rates of approximately 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 cases - Ectopic production of hCG can occur in conditions such as hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and germ cell tumors.[7] Other associated malignancies include multiple myeloma and stomach, liver, lung, bladder, pancreatic, breast, colon, cervical, and endometrial cancers [8][9][10][11][12] - Heterophile antibodies, including autoantibodies and antibodies formed after exposure to animal products that interact with the assay antibodies [13][14] - Rheumatoid factors can also bind to the antibodies in the assay - IgA deficiency [15] - Chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (rare) [16] - Red blood cell or plasma transfusion of blood with hCG has been reported - Exogenous hCG preparations for weight loss, assisted reproduction, and doping [17] **False-Negative Serum hCG Results** - Early measurement after conception - The hook effect can occur when hCG levels are about 500,000 mIU/mL.[18] This reading indicates that the abundance of hCG molecules saturates both the tracer and the antibodies separately, preventing the formation of the sandwich of tracer-hCG-antibody required for the measurement. This occurrence means that all the complexes are washed away, resulting in a false-negative result. If gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, the lab should perform a dilution before testing. **False-Positive**Urine\*\* hCG Results\*\* - Blood or protein in the urine - Human error in result interpretation - Ectopic production of hCG - Exogenous hCG - Influence of certain drugs such as aspirin, carbamazepine, and methadone; high urinary pH; and seminal fluid [19] **False-Negative Urine hCG Results** - Early measurement after conception - Dilute urine specimen [2] - The hook effect, as discussed above ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings hCG levels are reported in milli-international units of hCG hormone per milliliter of blood (mIU/mL). International units per liter (IU/L) may also be used. Serum assays are highly sensitive and can detect beta-hCG levels as low as 1 to 2 mIU/mL. Urine hCG testing can also be qualitative, reporting a
