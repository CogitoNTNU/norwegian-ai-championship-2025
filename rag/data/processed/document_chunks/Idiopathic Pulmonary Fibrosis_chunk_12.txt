mechanical ventilation with poor outcomes, it is essential to address goals of care early in the process.[66] **Investigational treatments:** In recent years, there has been an effort to discover drugs that can prevent or halt the formation of fibrosis and fibroblast. A translational study in mouse models demonstrated that aerosolized T3 thyroid hormone can inhibit lung fibrosis by enhancing mitochondrial function in epithelial cells.[67] Similarly, resmetirom, a thyroid hormone agonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first treatment for liver fibrosis due to fatty liver disease. This approval suggests a potential role in fibrosis treatment, but further studies in humans with IPF are needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety.[55] ## Differential Diagnosis The following conditions are part of the differential diagnosis for IPF: - Occupational lung diseases, including pneumoconiosis and asbestosis - Aspiration pneumonitis - Bacterial and viral pneumonia - Farmer's lung and other forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis - Fungal infection - Lung cancer - _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia - Sarcoidosis - Pulmonary edema - Connective tissue diseases ## Prognosis IPF is a progressive disorder with a median survival time of around 5 years. However, about 20% of patients are estimated to survive without any treatment. The uncertainty regarding the progression of the disease and the severity of the symptoms, along with its poor prognosis, have a profound impact on the quality of life of both patients and their families.[65] Since 2010, IPF survival rates have shown improvement, which may be partly attributed to antifibrotic therapies and earlier diagnosis.[68] Although the actual survival range for individual patients varies considerably, up to 20% to 25% may live beyond 10 years after diagnosis. Despite this, most patients continue to experience dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance, leading to a poor quality of life. Deaths are most common in winter, even in the absence of lung infections. Many patients develop pulmonary hypertension, increasing their risk of pulmonary embolism and sudden cardiac death. The prognosis tends to be worse for those with severe changes noted on imaging findings and a lack of response to oxygen therapy.[69][70] ## Complications Complications associated with IPF include pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolic disease, adverse effects of medications, superimposed lung infections, acute coronary syndrome, and hypoxic respiratory failure. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Currently, specific recommendations for screening or deterrence of F are not available. However, patients diagnosed with IPF should adhere to the following measures:[5][71][72]
