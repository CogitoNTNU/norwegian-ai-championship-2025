Transthoracic echocardiography - Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is less reliable for diagnosing aortic dissections due to poor visualization of the distal aorta but is beneficial for evaluating patients with acute aortic syndromes and assessing complications such as aortic regurgitation, left ventricular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion (suggesting tamponade).[7] TTE can be used as an initial bedside tool in unstable patients. - Aortography - Once the gold standard for evaluating aortic dissections, aortography is now rarely used for initial diagnosis but may still be employed when planning endovascular stent placement. **Risk Stratification Tools** Clinical decision-making tools such as the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) can help identify high-risk AAD patients. This scoring system incorporates factors from history, physical examination, and imaging to guide the need for further testing. A high-risk ADD-RS score, combined with elevated D-dimer, increases the likelihood of AAD and may justify immediate imaging. Prompt recognition and diagnosis of AAD are crucial to prevent catastrophic complications, including aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or ischemic injury to vital organs. Timely imaging, particularly CTA, remains central to confirming the diagnosis and guiding management decisions. ## Treatment / Management Management of aortic dissection begins with immediate stabilization and consultation with a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon, regardless of the location of the dissection. Due to the high mortality associated with untreated AAD, the approach to management involves a combination of urgent surgical intervention and medical therapy to reduce hemodynamic stress on the aorta. **Initial Stabilization and Medical Management** Once the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection is confirmed or highly suspected, a multidisciplinary team should be activated promptly. Initial management includes: - **Monitoring and access** - Continuous monitoring with an arterial line for real-time blood pressure measurements - Placement of a central venous catheter for hemodynamic monitoring and administration of medications - Foley catheter insertion to monitor urine output, as oliguria or anuria may indicate renal hypoperfusion - **Medical therapy** - Analgesia - Pain control is crucial. Morphine is the preferred analgesic as it controls pain and decreases sympathetic tone, which helps reduce blood pressure and heart rate. - Heart rate and blood pressure control - Short-acting intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmolol or labetalol) are the first-line agents. The goal is to maintain a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute to reduce the force of left ventricular ejection against the aortic wall. - Beta blockers should be used with caution in the setting of
