Phase III represents either resolution or progression to chronic disease. Potential outcomes include complete resolution with full recovery, chronic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyopathy, or progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] Autoimmunity has a significant role in inflammatory myocarditis.[15] Autoantibodies against the cardiac myosin chain are detected in more than half of cases of inflammatory myocarditis. Additionally, environmental factors may interact with genetic predispositions to promote inflammatory responses.[6] In viral myocarditis, the inflammatory process begins when the virus enters myocardial cells, triggering an innate immune response within the first week. This is followed by an adaptive immune response over the subsequent 1 to 4 weeks. In the chronic stage, chronic inflammation and remodelling of the myocardium can lead to myocardial dilation and the development of cardiomyopathy.[6][16] Viral-induced cell damage leads to the release of interleukins (ILs) and damage-associated molecular patterns, which facilitate the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the innate immune system. Additionally, stressors such as pain or anxiety activate medullary cells, triggering monocytopoiesis and the release of myeloid progenitor cells. The spleen is also activated to replenish proinflammatory cells, which then mobilize to the damaged myocardium. There, the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) further enhances the recruitment of inflammatory cells. This exaggerated inflammatory response to viral-induced myocardial damage contributes to chronic inflammation, myocardial remodeling, and eventual ventricular dysfunction.[6] In the innate immune response, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are the first to infiltrate the myocardium. Toll-like receptors on these immune cells recognize viral components, amplifying the inflammatory response. Natural killer cells are crucial in eliminating infected cells, setting the stage for the adaptive immune phase. In the adaptive immune phase, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells target viral peptides on infected myocytes, thereby inducing cell death. CD4+ helper T cells enhance the immune response by producing cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. B cells produce antibodies against viral antigens but can also generate autoantibodies targeting self-antigens through a process known as molecular mimicry. This phenomenon occurs when viral antigens closely resemble cardiac proteins, such as myosin, leading to autoimmune myocarditis. In the chronic phase, even after viral clearance, immune cells may continue to attack the heart due to the persistence of autoantigens. This prolonged inflammation causes myocyte necrosis, followed by fibrosis, and ultimately results in dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] ## History and Physical The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild viral illness to fulminant heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or sudden
