systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. [10][11][12] **Esophageal perforation** A left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. [11] **Gastrointestinal reflux disease** The patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy.[13] ## Differential Diagnosis - Acute coronary syndrome - Aortic dissection - Embolism - Gastroesophageal reflux - Muscle or skeletal pain - Esophageal rupture - Pericarditis - Pneumonia shingles - Pneumothorax - Pulmonary embolism - Cervical radiculopathy - Esophageal spasm ## Pearls and Other Issues Aortic dissection can cause a stroke. Do not forget to consider this in your workup. Younger patients and those without risk factors can still have an MI. People with diabetes and the elderly may have nerve damage which may make it difficult for them to interpret pain. They may have more atypical presentations of diseases like acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Chest pain is a common symptom encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary provider, internist, emergency department physician, and surgeon. In most cases, a thorough medical history will provide a clue to the diagnosis. The key is to not miss a life-threatening disorder like an acute MI or an aortic dissection. When the cause of chest pain remains unknown, it is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for care. The outcomes for patients with chest pain depending on the cause. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19382&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19382) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/chest-pain/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19382) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19382/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19382) ## References 1.
