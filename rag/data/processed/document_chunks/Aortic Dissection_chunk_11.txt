Short-acting intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmolol or labetalol) are the first-line agents. The goal is to maintain a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute to reduce the force of left ventricular ejection against the aortic wall. - Beta blockers should be used with caution in the setting of acute aortic regurgitation, where compensatory tachycardia may be beneficial for maintaining cardiac output. - If beta blockers are contraindicated (eg, in patients with severe asthma or bronchospastic disease), nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like diltiazem can be used as alternatives. - Blood pressure target - Systolic blood pressure should be lowered between 100 and 120 mm Hg, provided end-organ perfusion is not compromised. If additional blood pressure control is needed, nitroprusside can be added to the beta-blocker regimen. Other vasodilators, like nicardipine, may also be used. - Management of hypotension - In hypotensive patients, intravenous fluid resuscitation is the first approach. However, excessive fluid can exacerbate aortic wall stress, so caution is warranted. If hypotension persists, vasopressors (eg, norepinephrine) can be administered to maintain perfusion, but these agents should be used carefully as they can increase the force of ventricular contraction and potentially worsen the dissection. **Definitive Treatment Based on AAD Classification** The type and location of the dissection—classified by the Stanford or DeBakey systems—determine the need for surgical or medical intervention. - **Stanford type A dissections (involving the ascending aorta)** - Urgent surgical intervention - Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the risk of catastrophic complications such as cardiac tamponade, severe aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or aortic rupture. Surgical mortality varies from 5% to 20%. Surgical intervention involves: - Excision of the intimal tear - Remove the primary tear site and obliterate entry points into the false lumen to prevent further propagation. - Aortic replacement - Placement of a synthetic graft to reconstitute the aortic architecture - Aortic valve assessment and repair/replacement - If the dissection extends into the aortic root or involves the aortic valve, valve repair or replacement with a prosthetic valve may be necessary. The decision to perform a Bentall procedure (combined aortic root and valve replacement) is based on the extent of root involvement. - Management of aortic arch involvement - AADs that extend into the aortic arch are among the most complex to manage surgically, given the need for cerebral protection and the higher risk of neurologic complications, including paraplegia. - **Stanford
