bleeding. INR is particularly crucial for individuals on oral anticoagulants like warfarin, where maintaining a target INR range is essential for balancing the risk of bleeding and clotting. **D-Dimer** D-dimer is a marker for fibrin degradation products, indicating ongoing fibrinolysis. Normal D-dimer values are typically less than 500 ng/mL. Elevated D-dimer levels may be observed in conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other conditions associated with increased fibrin turnover. However, D-dimer is not specific, and elevated levels can also be seen in inflammation, infection, surgery, or pregnancy.[5] **Clinical Significance** **Prothrombin Time** The clinical significance of prothrombin time lies in its utility for monitoring and managing anticoagulant therapy, assessing liver function, and diagnosing bleeding disorders. - **Monitoring anticoagulant therapy:** PT is commonly used to monitor patients on oral anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin. Warfarin interferes with the synthesis of certain clotting factors, including factor II (prothrombin), and monitoring PT helps ensure that the patient is within the therapeutic range. The INR is often reported along with PT results to standardize the interpretation of the test across different laboratories. - **Assessing liver function:** PT is also used to assess liver function since the liver produces many clotting factors. Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or liver failure, can decrease the synthesis of clotting factors, resulting in prolonged PT. - **Diagnosing bleeding disorders:** Prolonged PT can detect abnormalities in the clotting factors involved in the extrinsic and common pathways. This can help diagnose conditions such as hemophilia, vitamin K deficiency, or other inherited or acquired bleeding disorders. - **Preoperative screening:** PT is sometimes used as part of preoperative screening to assess a patient's overall clotting ability. This helps identify individuals who may be at increased risk of bleeding during surgery. - **Monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation:** PT can be one of the parameters monitored in patients with DIC, a condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade. In DIC, both clotting factors and platelets are consumed, leading to abnormal bleeding and clotting at the same time. - **Assessing vitamin K status:** Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of certain clotting factors. PT can be used to assess vitamin K status, and prolonged PT may suggest a deficiency in this vitamin. **Partial Thromboplastin Time** PTT is often used with other tests, such as PT, to evaluate the overall coagulation function and monitor patients on
