This disruption leads to fragmented, nonrestorative sleep. Symptoms include loud, disruptive snoring, witnessed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. This condition has significant implications for cardiovascular health, mental well-being, quality of life, and driving safety. Diagnosis involves polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. Treatment options include continuous positive airway pressure therapy, oral appliances, and surgical interventions. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of OSA, as well as examines its causes, risk factors, and advancements in diagnostic techniques. This activity also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in managing OSA and fosters effective communication and teamwork among healthcare professionals. In addition, this activity provides interprofessional healthcare providers with insights into the latest advancements in diagnostic techniques and evidence-based treatment modalities, ensuring comprehensive care delivery and improved patient outcomes in OSA management. **Objectives:** - Identify key symptoms and risk factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea to accurately recognize at-risk individuals. - Implement evidence-based management strategies, including continuous positive airway pressure therapy, oral appliances, and surgery, to improve patient care. - Select the most appropriate diagnostic techniques and treatment options based on the individual patient's clinical presentation and preferences. - Collaborate with the interprofessional healthcare team to improve outcomes and provide comprehensive care for patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea.

Other symptoms include loud and disruptive snoring, witnessed apneas during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness.[2][3][4] OSA significantly affects cardiovascular health, behavioral conditions, quality of life, and driving safety.[5] Other types of sleep-disordered breathing, including central sleep apnea, upper airway resistance, and obesity hypoventilation, will be discussed separately.
