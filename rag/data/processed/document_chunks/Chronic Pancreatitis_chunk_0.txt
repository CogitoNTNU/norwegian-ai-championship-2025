Over time, normal pancreatic parenchyma is replaced by fibrotic tissue, causing chronic abdominal pain, malabsorption due to exocrine insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus. As the disease progresses, patients often experience debilitating symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life. Due to its complex pathophysiology and varied clinical manifestations, early recognition and a comprehensive management approach are essential to improving patient outcomes. This continuing education activity provides healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate, diagnose, and manage chronic pancreatitis effectively. Participants gain a deeper understanding of the disease's etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, enabling timely intervention. This activity emphasizes the importance of interprofessional collaboration—engaging specialists in gastroenterology, pain management, endocrinology, nutrition, and rehabilitation—to optimize patient care. By highlighting evidence-based treatment strategies and coordinated management, this activity aims to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals with chronic pancreatitis. **Objectives:** - Identify the early signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis to facilitate timely diagnosis and intervention. - Asses patients with chronic pancreatitis for complications such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and pancreatic insufficiency. - Implement evidence-based treatment strategies to manage chronic pain and address nutritional deficiencies in patients with chronic pancreatitis. - Communicate effectively with patients about lifestyle modifications, including alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, and dietary changes.

This organ plays a crucial role in digesting proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, working alongside bile from the common bile duct. Structurally, the pancreas contains a main pancreatic duct that joins with the common bile duct at the ampulla of Vater, an accessory duct that normally drains into the duodenum at the minor papilla, and smaller branched ducts emerging from the main pancreatic duct. These ducts can become obstructed or genetically malformed. Chronic inflammation can lead to scarring and fibrosis, causing permanent damage that impairs secretory functions.[1][2] Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease affecting
