severity and optimize patient outcomes by promoting self-management and reducing healthcare utilization. Enhancing patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team performance in asthma management demands a strategic approach. Each healthcare team member should possess the necessary clinical expertise to diagnose and treat asthma effectively, which involves interpreting spirometry findings and customizing treatment plans according to individual patient needs. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines and protocols will ensure uniform practices across healthcare settings. Effective interprofessional communication enables the exchange of information, collaborative decision-making, and seamless care transitions. Each healthcare team member, including physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and social workers, contributes unique skills to asthma care, further enriching interdisciplinary collaboration. By fostering a culture of collaboration, communication, and coordination, healthcare professionals can deliver comprehensive, patient-centered asthma care, decreasing morbidity and mortality and enhancing team performance. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17920&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17920) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/asthma/asthma/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17920) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17920/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17920) [![Pathophysiology of Asthma](/books/NBK430901/bin/Asthma_attack-illustration_NIH.gif)](/books/NBK430901/figure/article-17920.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK430901/figure/article-17920.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Pathophysiology of Asthma.
