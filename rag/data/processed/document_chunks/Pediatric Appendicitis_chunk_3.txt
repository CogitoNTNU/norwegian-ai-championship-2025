vascular thrombosis may be observed. Suppurative appendicitis has a varied gross appearance but commonly observed findings include poorly-demarcated serosa, dilation of the appendix, congestion of surface blood vessels, and fibrinopurulent serosal exudate. However, an increased appendiceal diameter alone is not a conclusive finding and should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and histopathological features. Gangrenous appendicitis is characterized by the necrosis of the appendix wall. If left untreated, perforation will eventually occur. In cases where perforation has taken place, transmural inflammation with areas of necrosis and extensive mucosal ulceration can be observed. Therefore, perforation is considered a complication of untreated gangrenous appendicitis. Grossly, the appendix wall appears friable and may display shades of purple, green, or black. Periappendicitis primarily involves serosal and subserosal inflammation without extending into the muscularis propria. The gross appearance of periappendicitis varies from normal serosa to congestion, accompanied by exudative infiltration.[16] Detailed histopathological findings differ in uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. **Uncomplicated Appendicitis** Uncomplicated appendicitis typically exhibits several characteristic features, including borderline-dilated serosal vessels, indicating increased appendiceal blood flow, and dulling of the serosa. Intraluminal neutrophils are another common finding. Furthermore, neutrophils may also be present within the mucosa and submucosa, and frank erosions may be seen. These findings indicate the presence of inflammation and tissue damage.[17] **Complicated Appendicitis** Complicated appendicitis with phlegmon exhibits several notable features. The appendiceal lumen is often dilated and filled with blood, indicating vascular congestion. Additionally, inflammation of the mesoappendix is observed, characterized by the presence of exudates. Neutrophils within the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria indicate a widespread inflammatory response. Extensive ulceration, signifying tissue damage and loss of epithelial lining, is commonly observed. Intramural microabscesses may also be present. Vascular thrombosis, resulting from the inflammatory process, is not uncommon. Complicated nonperforated appendicitis includes two distinct histopathologic categories: severe phlegmonous appendicitis and gangrenous non-perforated appendicitis. The histopathological findings of severe phlegmonous appendicitis are complex and are characterized by severe phlegmonous inflammation accompanied by obstruction and extraluminal fluid. The obstruction is usually caused by a fecalith, resulting in significant distal luminal dilation and adjacent fluid accumulation. The histological examination reveals pronounced transmural edema and infiltration of neutrophils throughout the appendiceal wall.[17] The histopathological examination of gangrenous appendicitis reveals a friable appendix with purple, green, or black discoloration. In addition, the appendix shows transmural inflammation, with areas of necrosis and extensive mucosal ulceration. These findings indicate a severe inflammatory process that has compromised
