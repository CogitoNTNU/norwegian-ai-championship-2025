most widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic medications.[2] Although the exact mechanism of action of the drug remains unclear, it is historically categorized along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to its inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[3][4] Acetaminophen possesses analgesic and antipyretic properties similar to NSAIDs but lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Acetaminophen may inhibit the COX pathway in the central nervous system (CNS) but not in peripheral tissues. In addition, acetaminophen does not appear to bind to the active site of either the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. Instead, it reduces the activity of COX through an alternative mechanism. There is also a theoretical proposition that acetaminophen inhibits a splice variant of COX-1, referred to as COX-3, although this hypothesis has not been verified in humans.[5] Regardless, the reduction of the COX pathway activity by acetaminophen is thought to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins in the CNS, leading to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. The analgesic properties may be due to a stimulating effect on the descending serotonergic pathways in the CNS. Additional research has proposed that acetaminophen or one of its metabolites, AM404, may activate the cannabinoid system. This activation could occur by inhibiting the uptake or degradation of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, thereby contributing to its analgesic action. AM404 exerts analgesic effects through dual modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the spinal cord dorsal horn. This involves facilitating spontaneous transmission and inhibiting C-fiber–evoked transmission, achieved via activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype-1 (TRPV1) receptors.[6] **Pharmacokinetics** **Absorption:** Oral acetaminophen is rapidly and efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes. Intravenous (IV) administration of acetaminophen resulted in immediate and higher peak plasma concentrations. The rectal route is preferred for administration to bypass first-pass metabolism, especially in unconscious patients and children. This approach offers an alternative to parenteral administration, thereby mitigating gastric irritation and enabling efficient absorption due to the rich vascular supply in the rectum. Absorption in the upper rectum guides medications into the portal circulation through the superior hemorrhoidal vein, whereas lower rectal absorption results in direct entry into the systemic circulation.[7] **Distribution:** Acetaminophen exhibits low plasma protein binding of 10% to 25% and shows extensive distribution throughout the body, excluding fat tissue.[8] **Metabolism:** Acetaminophen undergoes primarily hepatic metabolism via first-order kinetics, utilizing 3 distinct pathways—conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation facilitated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, predominantly
