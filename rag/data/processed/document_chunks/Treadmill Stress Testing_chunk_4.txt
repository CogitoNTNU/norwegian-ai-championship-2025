mild symptoms if no abnormalities are noted on ECG and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines have specified indications for the termination of exercise testing. The following are the absolute indications for termination of testing: - A drop in systolic blood pressure of greater than 10 mmHg from baseline when accompanied by other indications of ischemia. - Moderate-to-severe angina - Increasing neurologic symptoms, such as ataxia, dizziness, near-syncope - Signs of impaired perfusion, such as cyanosis or pallor - Technical difficulties in monitoring ECG tracings or systolic blood pressure - Patient's desire to stop - Sustained ventricular tachycardia - ST-elevation of more than 1 mm in leads without diagnostic Q waves, other than V or aVR[16] Relative indications for the termination of the procedure include the following: - A drop in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more from baseline in the absence of other evidence of ischemia - ST or QRS changes (excessive horizontal or downsloping ST depression of more than 2 mm) or marked axis shift - Arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia, multifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), heart block, or bradyarrhythmias - Fatigue, shortness of breath, leg cramps, wheezing, or claudication - Development of intraventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block that cannot be differentiated from ventricular tachycardia - Increasing chest pain - Hypertensive response (systolic blood pressure of 250 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure higher than 115 mmHg, or both)[17] At the conclusion of testing, a report should be included. This report should outline the baseline ECG interpretation, baseline heart rate, and blood pressure, ECG changes during exercise, including the presence of arrhythmia/ectopy and the onset of such changes, maximal heart rate and blood pressure during exercise, estimated exercise capacity in metabolic equivalents of task (METs), exercise duration and stage completed, symptoms experienced during exercise and the reason for terminating the test. A normal test is when a patient's blood pressure and heart rate increase appropriately to graded exercise. There should be no ECG changes suggestive of ischemia and no arrhythmias during testing. Failure of the blood pressure to increase or decrease with signs of ischemia has prognostic significance. Angina or significant ST depression (greater than 2 mm) before completing stage 2 of the Bruce protocol and/or ST depressions that persist for more than 5 minutes into recovery suggest severe ischemia and high risk for coronary events.
