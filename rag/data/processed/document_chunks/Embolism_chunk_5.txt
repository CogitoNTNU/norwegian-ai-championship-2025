In patients with preexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnea may be the only symptom. Chest pain is a frequent symptom usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal emboli causing pulmonary infarction.[24] In central PE, chest pain may be from underlying right ventricular ischemia and needs to be differentiated from an acute coronary syndrome or aortic dissection. Less common presentations include arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), syncope, and hemodynamic collapse.[25] Hemodynamic instability is a rare but essential form of clinical presentation, as it indicates central or extensive PE with severely reduced hemodynamic reserve. Syncope may occur and may be associated with a higher prevalence of hemodynamic instability and right ventricular dysfunction.[26] Recognizing that patients with large PE may sometimes be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms is crucial. PE may often be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally during diagnostic workup for another disease. Therefore, in addition to PE symptoms, clinicians should look for VTE risk factors to determine the clinical probability of PE. **Physical Examination Findings** On examination, patients with PE might have tachypnea and tachycardia, which are common but nonspecific findings. Other examination findings include calf swelling, tenderness, erythema, palpable cords, pedal edema, rales, decreased breath sounds, signs of pulmonary hypertension, eg, elevated neck veins, a loud P2 component of the second heart sound, a right-sided gallop, and a right ventricular parasternal lift. PE is a well-recognized cause of sudden cardiac arrest (8%).[27] A massive PE leads to an acute right ventricular failure, which presents as jugular venous distension, parasternal lift, third heart sound, cyanosis, and shock. In a patient with PE who has tachycardia on presentation and develops sudden bradycardia or a new broad complex tachycardia (with right bundle branch block), clinicians should consider the right ventricular strain and impending shock. PE should be suspected in anyone with hypotension with jugular venous distension when acute myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, or tension pneumothorax has been ruled out.[28] ## Evaluation **Diagnostic Evaluation of Acute Pulmonary Embolus** The diagnosis of an acute PE comprises various laboratory and imaging studies in conjunction with clinical probability scoring systems, such as the Wells and Geneva criteria. **Arterial blood gas analysis** Unexplained hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph should raise clinical suspicion for PE. Widened alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen, respiratory alkalosis, and hypocapnia are common findings on arterial blood gas (ABG) as a pathophysiological response to PE. Notably, respiratory or lactic acidosis is uncommon but can
