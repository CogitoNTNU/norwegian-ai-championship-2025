in incidence may be attributed to variations in healthcare-seeking behavior, age-related immune responses, and exposure to viral pathogens in different settings. In addition, several risk factors contribute to the development of acute bronchitis, including a history of smoking, residence in polluted areas, crowded living conditions, and a prior history of asthma. Specific allergens such as pollen, perfume, and vapors can potentially trigger acute bronchitis in susceptible individuals. In instances where the infection is of bacterial origin, the isolated pathogens tend to overlap with those commonly associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Examples of such pathogens are _Streptococcus_ _pneumonia_ and _Staphylococcus_ _aureus_.[15][16] ## Pathophysiology Acute bronchitis is inflammation affecting the large and mid-sized airways (bronchi), frequently precipitated by viral infections. The wide array of anatomical sites within the respiratory tract where these pathogens can take hold underscores the diverse impact of these microorganisms on the respiratory tract. A study involving volunteers exposed to rhinovirus infections demonstrated the various locations within the respiratory system where the virus could be detected.[9] The inflammatory process triggers increased blood flow and cellular activity within the affected bronchi, resulting in heightened 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake when observed via positron-emission tomography (PET) scan.[17] Additionally, bronchial inflammation can stem from various triggers, with viral infections, allergens, and pollutants among the most common culprits. The inflammation of the bronchial wall leads to mucosal thickening, epithelial cell desquamation, and denudation of the basement membrane. In some instances, a viral upper respiratory infection can progress to a lower respiratory tract infection, resulting in acute bronchitis.[18] ## History and Physical Patients affected with acute bronchitis typically exhibit a range of symptoms, including a productive cough, feelings of malaise, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. Often, the most prominent complaint is the persistent cough, with an accompanying clear or yellowish sputum production. However, on occasion, the sputum can take on a purulent appearance. Purulent sputum does not necessarily correlate with a bacterial infection or necessitate antibiotic treatment.[19] Following an episode of acute bronchitis, the cough typically persists for 10 to 20 days, with a median duration of 18 days.[20] Occasionally, bronchitis cough may extend beyond 4 weeks. Paroxysms of cough accompanied by an inspiratory whoop or posttussive emesis should raise concerns for pertussis infection. In the early stages of infection, the symptoms of mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can often overlap, creating a challenge in distinguishing between both based solely on symptoms. Both conditions may present
