Calcitonin is a peptide hormone consisting of 32 amino acids, primarily synthesized by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the human thyroid gland. The hormone exists in different forms, including salmon calcitonin, human calcitonin, and synthetic analog. Extensive research has been conducted on salmon calcitonin, revealing its heightened potency compared to the human variant, thus establishing it as the preferred option in clinical application. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved calcitonin for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, and hypercalcemia. The drug's clinical significance derives from its ability to inhibit osteoclast activity and increase the renal excretion of calcium. These mechanisms diminish the resorption of bone matrix and serum calcium levels. **FDA-Approved Indications** **Postmenopausal osteoporosis** Calcitonin is currently FDA-approved for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, provided the patient has been in the postmenopausal phase for a minimum of 5 years.[1] By inhibiting osteoclasts, bone mineral density (BMD) losses can be mitigated, and the risk of osteoporotic fractures can be lowered. The 5-year "PROOF" study involving 1108 postmenopausal women demonstrated that a daily intake of 200 IU intranasal calcitonin led to a remarkable 33% reduction in the risk of new vertebral fractures. The lumbar spine BMD increased from 1% to 1.5% from the baseline, whereas the placebo group experienced a decrease in bone turnover. However, the risk of hip and other non-vertebral fractures remained unchanged.[2] In a phase 3 clinical trial known as Oral Calcitonin in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (ORACAL), a total of 565 women between the ages of 46 and 86 were administered calcitonin. Notably, significant improvements in their lumbar, trochanteric, and femur bone mineral density (BMD) were observed, along with a reduction in markers indicative of bone resorption.[3] However, calcitonin exhibits comparatively lower efficacy than bisphosphonates in terms of elevating BMD and decreasing rates of bone turnover.[4] A slightly elevated incidence of malignancy has been observed in patients utilizing intranasal calcitonin instead of those receiving a placebo. Due to these factors, calcitonin is not considered a first-line treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, and the FDA suggests its use solely in situations where contraindications to alternative therapies are present. However, short-term use of calcitonin has also been demonstrated to significantly reduce osteoporotic bone pain compared to a placebo, especially in the acute setting.[5][6] Therefore, calcitonin may be a preferred treatment for acute osteoporotic fractures. In such circumstances, physicians are advised to administer calcitonin until the pain diminishes. This is
