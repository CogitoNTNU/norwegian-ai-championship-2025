ventricle (no significant right heart strain) or if it is as big or bigger than the left ventricle (evidence of right heart strain). This is particularly helpful in acute onset chest pain or shortness of breath when a pulmonary embolism is in the differential diagnosis.[17] A patient with no significant past medical history who has a large right ventricle on cardiac ultrasound has a pulmonary embolism until proven otherwise. A McConnell sign is even more specific for pulmonary embolism, where the right ventricle is large and hypokinetic with apical sparing (the apex is not hypokinetic like the rest of the right ventricle). These ultrasound findings for an otherwise healthy patient younger than 65 may benefit from thrombolytics.[3] ## Complications Cardiac ultrasound, like most diagnostic ultrasound applications, is associated with little, if any, risk. However, there may be some discomfort when acquiring certain views, such as the apical four-chamber view, with the pressure of the probe pressing against the ribs. ## Clinical Significance Cardiac ultrasound is a non-invasive, rapid, inexpensive application that expedites the diagnosis and management of imminently life-threatening diseases, including pericardial tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, and Stanford type A aortic dissection. Cardiac ultrasound can also differentiate shock states and guide resuscitative measures.[18] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The interprofessional team should perform cardiac ultrasound or echocardiography as needed to evaluate patients. This noninvasive diagnostic modality can quickly provide detailed hemodynamic information at the patient's bedside. Nurses should be prepared to assist the provider in point-of-care ultrasound applications from head to toe. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18908&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18908) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/cardiac-ultrasound-echocardiogram/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=18908) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18908/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18908) ## References 1.
