approach can lead to an underestimation of the AHI by at least 20%.[41] The AASM recommends using the term respiratory event index (REI) to differentiate the indices of respiratory events generated by a home sleep study (without recorded sleep). The AHI and REI represent the average number of obstructive events per hour, during sleep or recording time, respectively. Although most portable monitoring devices include flow sensors, other technologies, such as peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), use alternative methods without flow to identify sleep-disordered breathing events. The severity of OSA obtained using PAT devices is referred to as pAHI, which has been reported to provide indices similar to those derived from PSG-based AHI.[42] The severity of OSA in adults is classified based on AHI, REI, or pAHI as follows: - Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour - Moderate: Greater than 15 to 30 events per hour - Severe: Greater than 30 events per hour The disease burden in mild OSA is controversial and is primarily based on associated clinical sequelae, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep maintenance insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction.[43] Recent studies have challenged the traditional definition and scoring criteria of OSA in adults due to its limitations in capturing the pathophysiological impact on individual patients.[19] Various metrics have been proposed to improve the precision in diagnosing OSA,[44] including hypoxic burden, nocturnal heart rate changes, total sleep time with SpO2 less than 90% (TST90), duration of obstructive events, sleep arousal burden, and even genetic factors.[45][46][47][48][49][50][51] ## Treatment / Management Managing OSA requires a multifaceted approach that should be tailored to each patient. While treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes,[52] evidence regarding the impact of therapy on mild OSA remains limited or inconsistent, particularly in relation to neurocognition, mood, vehicle accidents, cardiovascular events, stroke, and arrhythmias.[43] **Lifestyle Changes and Treating Underlying Medical Conditions** The importance of weight loss should be emphasized in patients with OSA who are overweight or have obesity.[53][54] Although weight loss is recommended and can often decrease the severity of OSA, it is usually not curative. Patients should be educated about the impact of sleep duration on their health and encouraged to prioritize getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.[55] Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and certain antidepressants, as these may exacerbate their condition. Concomitant nasal obstruction should be addressed with nasal steroids for allergic rhinitis
