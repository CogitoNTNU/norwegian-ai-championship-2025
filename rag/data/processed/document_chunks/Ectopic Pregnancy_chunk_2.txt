can result in retention of an oocyte or embryo within the tube. Additionally, women with tubal ligation or other postsurgical alterations to their fallopian tubes are at risk for ectopic pregnancies due to alteration of the native function of the fallopian tube. Conversely, atypical ectopic pregnancies secondary to extratubal implantations may not result from tubal dysfunction or be associated with typical risk factors.[2] **Ectopic Pregnancy Risk Factors** Factors associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy include: - **Prior ectopic pregnancy** : Risk increases with previous ectopic pregnancies (10% after 1, >25% after 2 or more) - **Fallopian tube damage** : Due to infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia), prior pelvic or tubal surgery, or endometriosis - **Pelvic infections** : Including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and complications from ascending infections. - **Infertility and assisted reproductive technology** : Higher risk with increased embryo transfers, fresh (versus frozen) transfers, and cleavage-stage (Day 3) transfers - **Contraceptive use** : Although IUD users have a lower overall pregnancy risk, 53% of pregnancies occurring with an IUD are ectopic - **Smoking** : Associated with increased risk due to its impact on tubal function - **Advanced maternal age** :\*\*\*\* Women older than 35 have a higher risk - **Anatomical variations** : Congenital anomalies of the reproductive system may contribute - **Previous cesarean delivery** : Particularly in cases of prior breech presentation deliveries - **Progesterone-only contraception** : Slightly increased risk compared to other methods [1][4][7][2][5] Conversely, oral contraceptives, prior pregnancy termination, emergency contraception failure, and cesarean delivery are not associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.[4] ## Epidemiology Ectopic pregnancy accounts for approximately 1% to 2% of pregnancies in the United States and 2% to 5% among patients who have utilized assisted reproductive technology.[1][8] Emergency departments have reported a higher incidence of 6% to 16%.[7] However, the true prevalence may be underestimated due to cases managed outside hospital settings.[1] While the mortality rate from ruptured ectopic pregnancies has declined over the past few decades, they still contribute to pregnancy-related deaths. Furthermore, the various sites where ectopic pregnancy occurs have different incidences. Tubal ectopic pregnancies are the most common, with rupture rates around 15% in Western countries, a figure that may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] Cervical ectopic pregnancy has an incidence of \<1% and has been reported to occur following dilation and curettage in 70% of these patients. Ectopic pregnancies within the ovary occur in \<3% of cases,
