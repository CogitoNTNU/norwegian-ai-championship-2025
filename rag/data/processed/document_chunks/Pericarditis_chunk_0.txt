Besides acting as a protective barrier, it also affects cardiac hemodynamics. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which granulation tissue formation in the pericardium results in loss of pericardial elasticity, leading to restriction in the ventricular filling. It is usually a chronic condition; however, subacute, transient, and occult variants have been described. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the pathophysiology of constrictive pericarditis. - Evaluate the presentation of a patient with constrictive pericarditis. - Differentiate the treatment options for constrictive pericarditis. - Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by constrictive pericarditis.

Besides acting as a protective barrier, it also affects cardiac hemodynamics. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which granulation tissue formation in the pericardium results in loss of pericardial elasticity leading to restriction in the ventricular filling. It is usually a chronic condition however subacute, transient and occult variants have been described.[1][2] ## Etiology Worldwide, the leading cause of constrictive pericarditis is tuberculosis, and the incidence is about 50% of patients with tuberculous pericardial effusion despite antitubercular therapy. In developed nations, the leading cause of this condition is idiopathic or post-viral infection with incidence being 40% to 60% of total cases. It is also a known complication of any cardiac surgery and is a fairly common complication of mediastinal radiation therapy with an incidence ranging from 2% to 30% in patients treated with radiation. It has also been associated with connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis may be fairly simple however most of the time it is much more difficult to establish a cause. In many cases, a cause cannot be identified and is attributed to be an asymptomatic episode of viral pericarditis.[3][4][5] ## Epidemiology Approximately 9% of patients with acute pericarditis develop
