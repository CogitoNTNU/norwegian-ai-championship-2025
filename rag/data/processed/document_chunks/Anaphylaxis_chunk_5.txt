typically is responsive to fluid resuscitation and the above epinephrine. One to 2 L or 10 to 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid bolus should be given for observed hypotension. Albumin or hypertonic solutions are not indicated. **Adjunctive Therapies** When anaphylaxis is diagnosed, co-treatment is often initiated with steroids, antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators, and vasopressors. Glucagon can also be used if indicated. These agents can assist in refractory initial anaphylaxis or prevent recurrence and biphasic reactions. **Corticosteroids** Corticosteroids are given to reduce the length or biphasic response of anaphylaxis. There is minimal literature to support this use, specifically in anaphylaxis, but it has been proven effective in reactive airway diseases. Therefore, the use, dosages, and proposed mechanism of action mimic those of airway management protocols. Methylprednisolone (80 to 125 mg IV) or hydrocortisone (250 to 500 mg IV) are the accepted treatments during the acute phase, after which oral treatment of prednisone (40 to 60 mg daily or divided twice per day) is continued for 3 to 5 days. Again, if the source is unknown or there is a concern for a prolonged time before physician follow-up, a steroid taper of up to 2 weeks may be provided. Mineralocorticoid activity is responsible for fluid retention; dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are the preferred agents for those at risk as they induce the least mineralocorticoid effect. **Antihistamines** Antihistamines are often routinely used; the most common is H­1 blocker administration of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV/IM. While the clinical benefit is unproven in anaphylaxis, its utility is evident in more minor allergic processes. In severe cases, H2 blockers such as famotidine 20 mg intravenous (given over 2 minutes) or cimetidine (300 mg IV) may also be used in conjunction with H-­blocker as there is evidence suggesting histamine has crossover selectivity of receptors. Note that cimetidine has multiple precautions in at-risk populations such as renal or hepatic impaired patients or those taking beta-blockers. While intravenous is the initial route during stabilization, once the patient is stabilized, they may be switched to oral if continued therapy is desired. **Bronchodilators** Bronchodilators are useful adjuncts in patients with bronchospasm. Patients with previous histories of respiratory disease, most notably asthma, are at the highest risk. Treated with inhaled beta-agonists is the first-line treatment for wheezing; albuterol alone or as ipratropium bromide/albuterol. If there is refractory wheezing, intravenous magnesium is appropriate with dosage and treatment similar to severe asthma exacerbations. **Vasopressors** Vasopressors
