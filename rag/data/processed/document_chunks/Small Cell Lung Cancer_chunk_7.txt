a timely diagnosis and accurate staging. As per the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, the initial evaluation should be complete within six weeks in patients with tolerable symptoms and no complications. Only 26% and 8% of cancers are diagnosed at stages I and II, respectively, whereas 28% and 38% are diagnosed at stages III and IV respectively. Therefore, curative surgery is an option for only a minority of patients. Lung cancer evaluation can be divided as: 1. Radiological staging 1. Invasive staging **Goals of Initial Evaluation** - Clinical extent and stage of the disease - Optimal target site and modality of 1st tissue biopsy - Specific histologic subtypes - Presence of co-morbidities, para-neoplastic syndromes - Patient values and preferences regarding therapy **Radiologic Staging** Every patient suspected of having lung cancer should undergo the following tests: - Contrast-enhanced CT chest with extension to upper abdomen up to the level of adrenal glands - Imaging with PET or PET-CT directed at sites of potential metastasis when symptoms or focal findings are present or when chest CT shows evidence of advanced disease. **CT Scan** Intravenous (IV) contrast enhancement is preferable as it may distinguish mediastinal invasion of the primary tumor or metastatic lymph nodes from vascular structures. The significant advantage of CT is that it provides an accurate anatomic definition of the tumor within the thorax, which helps clinicians decide the optimal biopsy site. CT can also identify the following: - Tumor-related atelectasis - Post obstructive pneumonitis - Intra- or extrathoracic metastatic disease - Co-existing lung disease The main objective of a CT scan is to identify the extent of the tumor, its anatomical location, and the lymph node involvement. TNM staging relies heavily on lymph node involvement. Therefore, most societies in Europe and the United States agree to regard a lymph node of 1 centimeter or more in the short axis to be considered highly suspicious for malignancy. Lymph nodes can be enlarged secondary to acute inflammation, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation or recent viral infection. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT scan to identify malignancy are 55% and 81%, respectively. Hence, CT is not a good test for lung cancer staging. **Radiological Groups** The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has proposed grouping patients based on tumor extent and lymph node involvement. Although CT is not the right staging tool, it helps the clinician select the site
