per hour).[20]\*\*\*\* In the United States, it has been reported that 25% to 30% of men and 9% to 17% of women meet the criteria for OSA.[21][22] Prevalence is higher in Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations. Prevalence also increases with age, and when individuals are 50 years or older, and as many women as men develop the disorder. The increasing prevalence of OSA is related to the rising rates of obesity, ranging between 14% and 55%.[21] Some risk factors, including obesity and upper airway soft tissue structure, are genetically inherited.[23] ## Pathophysiology Upper airway obstruction during sleep is often caused by negative collapsing pressure during inspiration; however, progressive expiratory narrowing in the retropalatal area also has a significant role.[24] The magnitude of upper airway narrowing during sleep is often related to body mass index (BMI), indicating that both anatomical and neuromuscular factors contribute to airway obstruction.[25] The pressure-flow relationship through collapsible tubes is key to understanding the mechanisms of OSA.[26] Additional information on risk factors is available in the Etiology section. ## History and Physical Patients with suspected OSA usually present with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping, choking, or witnessed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the most common symptoms.[22] Many patients may only report daytime fatigue, with or without other associated symptoms. Therefore, it is important to objectively assess the distinction between sleepiness and fatigue. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) can be used to quantitatively evaluate the severity of sleepiness.[27] The ESS score ranges from 0 to 24; a score above 9 suggests excessive daytime sleepiness and warrants additional assessment. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) can also be used to assess the severity of fatigue symptoms.[28] The ESS and FSS are helpful tools, as sleepiness and fatigue symptoms may occur concurrently. Other symptoms may include morning headaches, nocturnal reflux, insomnia, and nocturia.[29][30][31] Symptoms of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia are more commonly reported by women.[32] The STOP-BANG questionnaire is one of the most widely accepted screening tools for OSA.[33] - Snoring: Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors)? - Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime? - Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep? - Blood pressure: Are you currently being treated for high blood pressure? - BMI: Is your BMI greater than 35 kg/m2? -
