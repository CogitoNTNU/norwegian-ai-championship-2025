Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (Station 2 to 4)** These lymph nodes occupy the superior mediastinum, hence, named accordingly. They are further subdivided into the following groups: Upperparatracheall (station 2R and 2L) - 2R nodes extend to the left lateral border of the trachea. This extends from the upper border of the manubrium to the intersection of the caudal margin of the innominate (left brachiocephalic) vein with the trachea. - 2L nodes extend from the upper border of the manubrium to the superior border of the aortic arch. 2L nodes are located to the left of the left lateral border of the trachea Pre-vascular (station 3A) These nodes are not adjacent to the trachea like the nodes in station 2, but they are anterior to the vessels. Pre-vertebral (station 3P) Nodes not adjacent to the trachea like the nodes in station 2, but behind the esophagus, which is pre-vertebral Lower para-tracheal (station 4R and 4L) - 4R nodes extend from the intersection of the caudal margin of the innominate (left brachiocephalic) vein with the trachea to the lower border of the azygos vein. 4R nodes extend from the right to the left lateral border of the trachea. - 4L nodes extend from the upper margin of the aortic arch to the upper rim of the left main pulmonary artery **Aortic Lymph Nodes (5 and 6)** This group includes: Sub-aortic nodes (station 5) These nodes are located lateral to the aorta and pulmonary trunk in the so-called AP window. Para-aortic node (station 6) These are ascending aorta or phrenic nodes lying anterior and lateral to the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. **Inferior Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (Station 7 to 9)** This group includes sub-carinal and para-esophageal nodes: Sub-carinal nodes (station 7) They extend in a triangular fashion from the division of carina superiorly to the lower border of the bronchus intermedius on the right and the upper border of the lower lobe bronchus on the left. Para-esophageal nodes (station 8) These nodes are situated adjacent to the right and left sides of the esophageal wall. Both stations 7 and 8 are located below the carina. Pulmonary Ligament (station 9) They are located within the pulmonary ligaments extending from the inferior pulmonary vein up to the diaphragm. **Hilar Lymph Nodes (Station 10 to 14)** These are all N1 nodes. These include nodes adjacent to the main stem bronchus and hilar vessels. On the right,
