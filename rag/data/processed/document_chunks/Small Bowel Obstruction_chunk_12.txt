involving complete obstruction or signs of ischemia, require operative management.[31] **Nonoperative Management** Nonoperative or conservative management is suitable for simple SBO without signs of ischemia, peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. This approach involves bowel rest with the patient kept nil per os to minimize bowel distension. Serial monitoring of vital signs, abdominal exams, and laboratory tests is essential to detect any worsening condition. Water-soluble contrast studies using agents like gastrograffin can help resolve adhesional obstructions and offer prognostic value by indicating whether the obstruction may resolve without surgery. **Indications for Surgery** Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with evidence of strangulation, such as fever, tachycardia, localized tenderness, leukocytosis, or acidosis. Surgical intervention is imperative when SBO fails to resolve with conservative measures or when there are signs of peritonitis or bowel ischemia, ensuring timely and effective treatment.[32] **Surgical Management** Surgical options depend on the underlying cause of SBO. Adhesiolysis is the most common procedure, performed laparoscopically or via open surgery, to release fibrous bands causing the obstruction. For strangulated obstruction, resection of the necrotic bowel may be required, followed by either primary anastomosis or stoma formation, depending on the extent of damage and patient stability. In cases of questionable bowel viability or extensive ischemia, second-look laparotomy or temporary abdominal closure techniques, such as vacuum-assisted closure, may be required.[33][34] Hernia-related obstructions are managed with hernia reduction and repair, while tumor-related obstructions often necessitate bowel resection, sometimes with palliative intent in advanced malignancy cases. Palliative options like octreotide can be employed for malignant obstructions.[35] Preventative strategies, such as laparoscopic techniques and barrier agents like a chemically modified membrane made of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose that's applied to the surface of tissues, help reduce adhesion formation. **Postoperative Care** Postoperative care involves close monitoring for complications such as infection, anastomotic leaks, or recurrent obstruction. Early ambulation is encouraged to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and expedite recovery. Nutritional support with gradual reintroduction of oral intake is guided by the resolution of bowel function, evidenced by decreased NG tube output, bowel sounds, and passage of gas or stool. **Management of Functional Obstruction** Functional obstructions, such as paralytic ileus, are treated with supportive measures, including bowel rest, correction of metabolic abnormalities, reduction in narcotic use, and the potential use of prokinetic agents like metoclopramide. **Recurrent Obstructions** For patients with recurrent SBO, often due to adhesions, preventive strategies may include minimally invasive surgical techniques and adhesion barriers
