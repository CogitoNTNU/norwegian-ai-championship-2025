the 6- to 24-hour window following symptom onset and displays a large-vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation, it is recommended to use diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) with or without MR perfusion or CT perfusion for evaluation.[45][46] For patients experiencing a "wake-up" stroke or with an uncertain time of symptom onset, obtaining an MRI is crucial in identifying diffusion-positive fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-negative lesions. This imaging technique assists in determining whether the patient would benefit from thrombolytic therapy.[47] In patients diagnosed with ICH, performing a CTA within the first few hours of symptom onset can help identify individuals at risk of experiencing hematoma expansion (HE). Furthermore, serial head CT scans within the first 24 hours can assess for any HE.[39] The diagnosis of SAH is primarily based on NCCT imaging. A lumbar puncture is recommended if the CT scan yields negative results despite a high clinical suspicion. A recent study found that when the Ottawa SAH rule was employed to interpret a CT scan conducted within 6 hours of headache onset, the diagnosis of SAH demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 100%.[48] When assessing SAH, CTA can be taken into consideration. However, if the results of CTA are inconclusive, the gold standard study for detecting aneurysms is digital subtraction catheter angiography with 3-dimensional reconstruction.[49][50] As per the 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines, it is recommended to assess the blood glucose levels in all patients before initiating IV alteplase because both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can mimic AIS. Furthermore, conducting a baseline electrocardiographic assessment is advised for patients presenting with AIS, but it should not delay the initiation of IV alteplase. Similarly, a baseline troponin assessment is recommended, but it should not hinder the initiation of IV alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy.[44] ## Treatment / Management The chances of complete neurological recovery decrease with every minute an acute stroke remains untreated. This forms the "time is brain" concept foundation, highlighting the importance of promptly evaluating and managing acute stroke cases. **Ischemic Stroke** Here are the key highlights from the 2019 AHA/ASA Management Guidelines for AIS:[44] - Airway, breathing, and oxygenation: Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients to maintain the oxygen saturation above 94%. However, it is not recommended for nonhypoxic patients. - Blood pressure (BP): Patients with elevated BP should have their BP carefully reduced to a systolic BP (SBP) below 185 mm Hg and diastolic BP below 110 mm Hg before initiating
