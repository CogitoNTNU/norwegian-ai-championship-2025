experience acute respiratory failure or neurological deficits based on the location of bleeding or clots.[11][16][17] ## Evaluation No single history, physical exam, or laboratory component can lead to a diagnosis of or rule out DIC; therefore, a combination of subjective, objective, and laboratory findings should be utilized. Laboratory findings suggestive of DIC include an increased prothrombin time (PT) and an increased partial thromboplastin time, as well as a decreased fibrinogen level as widespread activation and consumption of the clotting cascade occurs. The overall platelet count and hematocrit level may be reduced as well. Schistocytes or fragmented erythrocytes are also commonly seen on a peripheral blood smear. The presence of fibrin split products additionally has a high sensitivity but low specificity for DIC. A specific scoring system to assess the presence of DIC was established in 2007. This score includes platelet count, fibrin markers such as D-dimer, PT, and fibrinogen level, with a score over 5 indicating a high likelihood for overt DIC.[18][19][20][21] ## Treatment / Management The treatment for DIC centers on addressing the underlying disorder that ultimately led to this condition. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and consideration for exploratory surgical intervention in trauma-related cases represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. A common threshold utilized for platelet transfusions in this patient population is less than 50 x 109 platelets/L for actively hemorrhaging patients and 10-20 x 109 platelets/L for those not actively bleeding but at high risk of future bleeding. Likewise, fresh frozen plasma, typically at 15 mL/kg to 30 mL/kg, and cryoprecipitate can be transfused to replenish coagulation factors. Prothrombin complex concentrate may also be considered; however, this formulation only contains some coagulation factors and will only mildly correct a patientâ€™s hemostasis. Heparin may also become necessary if a patient has extensive clotting, as this medication may prevent further activation of the clotting cascade. Patients with DIC who are not actively bleeding should receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin.[5][11][19][20][22] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for disseminated intravascular coagulation includes: - Dysfibrinogenemia - Hemolytic uremic syndrome - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - Immune thrombocytopenia - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ## Pearls and Other Issues Disseminated intravascular coagulation can quickly lead to multiorgan
