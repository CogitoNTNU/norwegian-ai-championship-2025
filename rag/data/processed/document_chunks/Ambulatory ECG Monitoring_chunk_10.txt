monitoring found bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias in approximately 15% of patients before TAVR, which led to treatment changes in approximately half of these cases. Identifying severe bradyarrhythmias before TAVR permits planned pacemaker implantation and decreases procedural complications. Detecting atrial fibrillation before TAVR can prompt early anticoagulation therapy and potentially reduce post-TAVR cerebrovascular events.[70] ## Patient Safety and Education To uphold patient safety during this process, healthcare providers must adhere to strict quality control measures and ensure the accurate placement and functioning of the monitoring device. Additionally, comprehensive patient education is vital to optimizing the use and management of the monitoring device. Educating patients about potential discomforts, troubleshooting procedures, and the importance of maintaining baseline activities and routines can enhance their adherence to the monitoring process and increase the overall quality of the collected data. Healthcare professionals can maximize the diagnostic yield, facilitate timely interventions, and improve patient outcomes by fostering patient safety and education in ambulatory ECG monitoring. ## Clinical Significance Ambulatory ECG monitoring plays a pivotal role in cardiology by providing continuous, prolonged ECG recording outside the clinical setting. Ambulatory ECG monitoring promotes the capture of elusive arrhythmias, gauges treatment efficacy, aids in risk stratification, and enhances syncope evaluation. As technology evolves, the potential for more advanced ambulatory monitoring devices promises further refinement of patient care strategies in cardiology. **Diagnosing Arrhythmias and Cardiac Abnormalities** Ambulatory ECG monitoring offers a dynamic insight into the heart's electrical activity throughout an extended period, enabling the detection of arrhythmias and cardiac abnormalities that might be missed during conventional ECGs. This technique captures intermittent or transient arrhythmic events, such as atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias, and premature ventricular contractions. By providing a comprehensive overview of a patient's heart rhythm, ambulatory monitoring aids in accurate diagnosis and informs appropriate treatment strategies.[71] **Risk Stratification and Prognosis** Risk stratification is critical to managing cardiac patients, and ambulatory ECG monitoring contributes significantly to this process. Through continuous monitoring, clinicians can quantify the burden of arrhythmias, aiding in identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from interventions such as anticoagulation therapy or ICDs.[41] **Syncope Evaluation** Syncopal episodes often pose diagnostic challenges due to their transient nature. Ambulatory ECG monitoring offers a valuable solution by recording cardiac activity during these episodes, potentially capturing arrhythmias or cardiac anomalies that could underlie the syncopal events. This data-driven approach enhances the accuracy of diagnosis and facilitates appropriate management strategies for patients experiencing unexplained syncope.[72] **Long-Term Monitoring** Certain
