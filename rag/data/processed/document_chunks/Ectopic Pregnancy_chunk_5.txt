identify the patient's last menstrual period and whether they have monthly routine menstrual periods. A missed last period, abnormal uterine bleeding, or sexual activity are suggestive of a possible pregnancy and, therefore, are also indications for further testing with a pregnancy test.[6] Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy should also be obtained in the clinical history.[13] **Physical Examination** After obtaining a thorough history, an attentive physical exam should be performed to help guide further diagnostic testing. Evaluation of vital signs for tachycardia and hypotension is pivotal in determining the patient's hemodynamic stability.[1] When examining the abdomen and suprapubic regions, attention should focus on the location of tenderness and any exacerbating factors. If voluntary or involuntary guarding of the abdominal musculature is elicited on palpation, possible free fluid suggestive of ruptured ectopic or peritonitis etiologies should be considered.[6] Palpating a gravid uterus may suggest an intrauterine pregnancy; however, this does not exclude an ectopic or heterotopic pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding should be assessed with a pelvic examination in addition to evaluating for cervical abnormalities, cervical os dilation, visible products of conception, and signs of infection. Bimanual pelvic exams additionally allow for palpation of bilateral adnexa to assess for abnormal masses or elicit adnexal tenderness.[1] ## Evaluation **Diagnostic Evaluation of Ectopic Pregnancy** The diagnostic evaluation of ectopic pregnancy primarily relies on the assessment of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels in conjunction with imaging modalities such as transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS). Among these, TVUS has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive and accurate for early detection of ectopic pregnancy, particularly when enhanced with 3-dimensional imaging and color Doppler ultrasound (see **Image**. Ectopic Pregnancy).[4] Serum β-hCG trends play a crucial role in diagnosis. The presence of a β-hCG level >2000 mIU/mL without visualization of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. The rate of β-hCG increase is also informative: in a viable IUP with an initial β-hCG level \<1500 mIU/mL, a 99% likelihood of a minimum 49% rise over 48 hours is typical. A slower rise or a decrease of at least 21% over 48 hours is more indicative of miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. A decreasing serum β-hCG level is more suggestive of a spontaneous early pregnancy loss.[1][6] The discriminatory β-hCG level, the threshold above which an IUP should be visible on TVUS, varies based on equipment, sonographer expertise, and gestational number.
