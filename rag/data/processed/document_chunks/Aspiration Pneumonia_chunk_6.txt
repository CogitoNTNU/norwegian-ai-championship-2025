The presence of infiltrates in dependent areas highly indicates aspiration pneumonia, especially in older adults. However, the specific location of the dependent regions can vary depending on an individual's mobility status. For instance, in mostly upright patients, infiltrates in the basal segments of the lower lobes and the right middle lobe suggest aspiration pneumonia (see **Image.** Aspiration Pneumonia). Conversely, in predominantly bedridden patients, infiltrates may appear in the superior segments of the lower lobes or posterior parts of the upper lobes (see **Image.** Ventilator-Associated Aspiration Pneumonia). In most cases of aspiration pneumonia, the right lung is more frequently affected than the left.[1] However, the presence of a left-sided infiltrate does not exclude aspiration pneumonia. Bilateral lower lobe involvement may be seen in patients who aspirate while upright, while left-sided infiltrates can occur in those who aspirate while in the left lateral decubitus position. Additionally, patients who aspirate while prone may present with right upper lobe infiltrates.[4] In patients with fluoroscopically documented dysphagia, bronchopneumonia is more commonly observed than lobar pneumonia. Additionally, most (92%) of these patients develop posterior infiltrates. Furthermore, patients with poor performance typically exhibit diffuse rather than focal infiltrates.[6] Although a plain radiograph of the chest suffices to acquire this information, it may fail to detect an infiltrate in up to 25% of the cases that are subsequently found to have an infiltrate on CT.[1] In a study involving 208 patients with pneumonia, over 60% had aspiration, and the chest radiograph yielded negative results in 28% of them. However, they were subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia upon CT examination.[6] Ultrasonography also demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia detection. In cases where the CXR is negative, some diagnostic algorithms recommend performing a lung ultrasound before CT to identify the presence of aspiration pneumonia.[3] **Laboratory Testing** Laboratory evaluation typically reveals acute inflammation and infection signs, such as an elevated white blood cell count (WBC). However, this may not occur in frail older patients as they may be unable to mount an effective response to infection.[1] Currently, no specific biomarker distinguishes aspiration pneumonia from other diseases or even pneumonitis. Some experts suggest using serum procalcitonin levels to differentiate aspiration pneumonia from
