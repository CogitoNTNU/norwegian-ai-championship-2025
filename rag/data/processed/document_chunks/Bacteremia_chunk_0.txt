Asymptomatic bacteremia can occur in normal daily activities such as conducting oral hygiene and after minor medical procedures. In a healthy person, these clinically benign infections are transient and cause no further sequelae. However, when immune response mechanisms fail or become overwhelmed, bacteremia becomes a bloodstream infection that can evolve into many clinical spectrums and is differentiated as septicemia. This activity describes the causes and presentation of bacteremia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of bacteremia. - Outline the workup of a patient with bacteremia. - Review the treatment and management options available for bacteremia. - Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with bacteremia.

Asymptomatic bacteremia can occur in normal daily activities such as conducting oral hygiene and after minor medical procedures. In a healthy person, these clinically benign infections are transient and cause no further sequelae. However, when immune response mechanisms fail or become overwhelmed, bacteremia becomes a bloodstream infection that can evolve into many clinical spectrums and is differentiated as septicemia. Untreated and clinically significant bacteremia progresses to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). [1][2][3] ## Etiology Determining the primary source of infection is critical in the management of a patient with bacteremia, as well as in the identification of the affected patient population. Common sources in hospitalized patients include the respiratory tract and indwelling catheters, specifically central venous catheters. Untreated urinary tract infections most commonly cause community-acquired bacteremia. Soft tissue and intraabdominal infections are not as common and are more prevalent in the post-operative surgical setting. _Escherichia coli_ is the most common cause of gram-negative associated bacteremia, while _Staphylococcus aureus_ is the most common gram-positive organism.[4][5][6] ## Epidemiology Geographic region, patient population, drug resistance, and infection prevention practices at each institution drive the causative organisms of bloodstream infections.
