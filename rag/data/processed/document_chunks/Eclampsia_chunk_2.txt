gestations, can precipitate preeclampsia, which may progress to eclampsia if not managed effectively. The premature aging of the placenta and breakdowns in maternal-fetal immune tolerance further exacerbate the risk, indicating a complex interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of eclampsia.[2][4] ## Epidemiology Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are reported to affect approximately 10% to 20% of pregnancies in the United States (US).[1] However, the incidence of new-onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has increased by almost 50% in the last 15 years, primarily in rural and urban areas.[5] Moreover, the prevalence of postpartum preeclampsia ranges from 0.3% to 27.5% in the US, with the variability in reported incidence likely arising from the underreporting of patients with milder conditions.[1] While preeclampsia is estimated to occur in 3% to 8% of pregnancies, the mortality rate is significantly higher in younger patients, ranging between 5% and 20%.[3] Results from a recent cross-sectional study of nearly 28 million live births between 2009 and 2017 showed that 0.3% were linked to eclampsia.[6] Another study's results, cited by the American Heart Association, reported an adjusted odds ratio for eclampsia in women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy of 65.9 (43.6â€“99.6).[7] Globally, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in gravidas and infants.[8] The prevalence of preeclampsia is approximately 4.6% worldwide, while eclampsia is estimated at 0.3%, according to the World Health Organization.[9] The incidence of eclampsia varies regionally, with low- and middle-resource countries reporting a higher incidence of 0.5%.[9] **Eclampsia Risk Factors** Eclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have many of the same risk factors: chronic hypertension, younger age, those with lower education levels, and first-time mothers.[10] According to the results from a recent eclampsia study, approximately one-third of eclampsia cases occurred in women younger than 20.[9] Other risk factors include: - Personal history of pregnancy hypertensive disorder - Family history of preeclampsia - Prepregnancy chronic hypertension - Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, renal disease, and autoimmune disorders - Maternal obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) - History of preterm birth less than 32 weeks of gestation [11] - Low socioeconomic status - Insufficient prenatal care [11] - Maternal age older than 35 - Multifetal gestation - Interval since previous birth of 10 or more years - African American ethnicity - In vitro fertilization [12][13] ## Pathophysiology Eclampsia and preeclampsia were once thought to be caused by "toxins"
