vascular permeability, hyperemia, myocyte necrosis, fibrosis, and pericardial involvement. Key imaging findings are listed below. - Early gadolinium enhancement or EGE: This suggests the expansion of the extracellular space due to capillary leakage and hyperemia. - T1 mapping: This reveals increased T1 values, indicating cellular damage, edema, and inflammation. - T2 mapping: This demonstrates increased T2 signal intensity, indicating myocardial edema. - Late gadolinium enhancement or LGE: This identifies patchy fibrosis and necrosis, typically in a nonischemic distribution—most often subepicardial or midwall—and commonly affects the inferolateral wall. The lack of enhancement in a coronary artery distribution helps differentiate myocarditis from ischemic injury. - Extracellular volume or ECV: An increased ECV indicates expansion of the interstitial space caused by edema, inflammation, or fibrosis. This parameter is valuable in distinguishing active myocardial inflammation from chronic scarring. The 2018 updated Lake Louise criteria are widely used for diagnosing myocarditis.[17] A diagnosis of acute myocarditis is considered probable when at least one T2-based criterion and one T1-based criterion are present. T1-based criteria include nonischemic LGE, increased native T1 values, or increased ECV. T2-based criteria include increased T2 values or increased myocardial T2 signal intensity. **Endomyocardial biopsy** EMB remains the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of myocarditis. - According to the 2024 ACC ECDP, EMB is indicated in the following scenarios: - Stage B myocarditis in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). - Stage C myocarditis in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias, or peripheral eosinophilia. - Patients who are unable to undergo cardiac MRI or have an uncertain diagnosis. - Stage D myocarditis patients. - A biopsy should not be performed in stage B patients who are not receiving ICIs, have normal ejection fraction, minimal or no LGE, or exhibit hemodynamic or electrical instability.[5] EMB is recommended only when the potential clinical benefit clearly outweighs the risks associated with the procedure. - The rate of major complications—such as cardiac perforation, tamponade, pneumothorax, arrhythmias, embolism, and valvular injury—is less than 1% when the procedure is performed in experienced centers. - The histopathology of acute myocarditis varies depending on the causative organism and the extent of myocardial damage, which can be either focal or diffuse. Necrosis involving the coronary vessels may also be observed. In chronic cases, fibrosis may become evident. EMB is not routinely performed in nonfatal cases. Patients with myocarditis may or may not show evidence of viral genomes through
