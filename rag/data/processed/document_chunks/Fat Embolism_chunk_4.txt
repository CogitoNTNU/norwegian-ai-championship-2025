intraoperative maneuvers should be noted in the history. Sickle cell disease and other forms of hemoglobinopathy can precipitate FES. Patients should be asked about the history of sickle cell disease in family members and any complications of sickle cell disease like acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises, or avascular necrosis of long bones. The history of drug ingestion or alcoholism that can trigger pancreatitis leading to FES should also be clarified. The symptoms of fat embolism and FES are nonspecific. Patients might complain of the following: - Pain related to bone fracture - Nausea - General weakness - Malaise - Difficulty breathing - Headache **Signs and Symptoms** These include but are not limited to the following: \*\*_Respiratory_ \*\* - Tachypnea - Tachycardia - Diaphoresis **_Central nervous system_** - Agitation from hypoxia - Restlessness - Change in mental status - Seizure - Coma \*\*_Skin_ \*\* Petechial rash \*\*_Eye_ \*\* Retinal hemorrhage **Physical Examination** The examination of a patient with FES should be very thorough. Particular attention should be paid to the patient's general appearance. \*\*_General Appearance_ \*\* Most patients with FES are anxious, agitated, and ill-looking. \*\*_Respiratory system_ \*\* \_\_ Assess for abnormal breath sounds, work of breathing, and evidence of respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure. \*\*_Cardiovascular_ \*\* The blood pressure and heart rate might be high in the beginning, but patients might suffer a cardiovascular collapse with ensuing hypotension \*\*_Central nervous system_ \*\* \_\_ A Glasgow Coma Scale assessment of less than 8 indicates that the airway should be secured and the patient placed on mechanical ventilation. Symptoms involving the central nervous system in FES are thought to arise from cerebral edema rather than cerebral ischemia. \*\*_Skin_ \*\* \_\_ Usually, a petechial rash on the skin with all the risk above factors should alert the clinician about FES. \*\*_Eye_ \*\* \_\_ A fundoscopic examination is necessary to check for the presence of retinal hemorrhage. ## Evaluation Diagnosis of FES can be very challenging because the signs and symptoms can be vague. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria. Based on experience and research, several authors have proposed diagnostic criteria for FES.[3][4][5] Gurd et al in 1970 and later Wilson in 1974 put forward the following diagnostic criteria: 2 major criteria or at least one major criteria and 4 minor criteria. **Major Criteria** - Petechial rash - Respiratory insufficiency - Cerebral involvement in non-head injury patients **Minor Criteria** - Fever greater
