Most patients presenting with heart failure have a form of volume overload. AHA and ACC guidelines recommend intravenous loop diuretic administration to treat fluid overload. Intravenous administration is preferred over oral diuretics to maximize the bioavailability of the medication and clinical effects. Furosemide is a common treatment for acute decompensated heart failure and flash-pulmonary edema because of its anti-vasoconstrictor and diuretic effects.[2][6] - **Vasodilators:** Patients with acute decompensated heart failure with hypertension and acute pulmonary edema can benefit from treatment with vasodilators. Most vasodilators promote smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation to reduce preload and afterload through the cyclic guanine monophosphate pathway. Vasodilation relieves pulmonary vascular congestion and improves left ventricular preload and afterload. The common vasodilator medications used are nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside.[2][6] - ``` * Nitroglycerin can be given transdermally, sublingually, or intravenously, depending on the patient's condition. In acute decompensation or flash pulmonary edema, nitroglycerin is best given sublingually or intravenously to allow for titration of effect.[2][6] ``` - Sodium nitroprusside is only given intravenously. Patients with renal dysfunction treated with sodium nitroprusside may need to have their cyanide levels monitored. Check with your pharmacist about guidelines for monitoring cyanide levels.[2][6] - **Ionotropic Medications:** Additional treatment options for patients in cardiogenic shock or who have signs of end-organ dysfunction secondary to hypoperfusion. Inotropes should only be used as a treatment adjunct in acute decompensated heart failure since data from the ADHERE registry suggest increased mortality with use. Dobutamine and mllrinone are 2 inotropes that are more commonly used. Dobutamine is preferable for patients who are beta-blocker-naive, while milrinone is preferred for patients previously taking oral beta blockers who experience acute decompensation.[2][6] - **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP):** These are noninvasive methods of respiratory support to treat respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. The use of CPAP and BIPAP has reduced the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in heart failure patients with acute respiratory decompensation. In situations where CPAP and BIPAP are ineffective in improving the patient's respiratory status, early intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered to help prevent further decompensation and progression of symptoms.[7][8] - **Coronary revascularization:** When performed in appropriately selected patients, revascularization can reduce mortality and morbidity by improving diastolic and systolic dysfunction. According to the AHAs 2013 congestive heart failure guidelines, coronary artery revascularization may be indicated as an intervention for heart failure
