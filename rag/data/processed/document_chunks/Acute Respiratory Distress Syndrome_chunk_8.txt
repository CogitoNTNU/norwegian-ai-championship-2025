beyond the lung. Prolonged mechanical ventilation often leads to bedsores, deep venous thrombosis, multisystem organ failure, weight loss, and poor overall functioning. It is essential to have an integrated approach to ARDS management because it usually affects many organs in the body. These patients need nutritional support, chest physiotherapy, treatment for sepsis if present, and potentially hemodialysis. Many of these patients remain in the hospital for months, and even those who survive face severe challenges due to a loss of muscle mass and cognitive changes (due to hypoxia). Evidence shows that an interprofessional team approach improves outcomes by facilitating communication and ensuring timely intervention.[25] The team and responsibilities should consist of the following: - Intensivist: Manages ventilator use and ICU issues like pneumonia prevention and DVT prophylaxis. - Dietitian and Nutritionist: Provide nutritional support. - Respiratory Therapist: Oversees ventilator settings. - Pharmacist: Manages medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics. - Pulmonologist: Addresses lung diseases. - Nephrologist: Manages kidney health and renal replacement therapy. - Nurses: Monitor patient health, assist with movement, and educate families. - Physical Therapist: Aids in regaining muscle function. - Tracheostomy Nurse: Helps with tracheostomy maintenance and weaning. - Mental Health Nurse: Assesses psychological well-being. - Social Worker: Manages rehabilitation transfers, follow-up care, and any financial issues the patient may have. - Chaplain: Provides spiritual support. **Outcomes** Despite advances in critical care, ARDS still has high morbidity and mortality. Even those who survive can have a poorer quality of life. While many risk factors are known for ARDS, there is no way to prevent the condition. Besides restricting fluids in high-risk patients, close monitoring for hypoxia by the team is vital. The earlier the hypoxia is identified, the better the outcome. Those who survive have a lengthy recovery period to regain functional status. Many continue to have dyspnea even with mild exertion and thus depend on care from others. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17172&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17172) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17172) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17172/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17172) [![Image ](/books/NBK436002/bin/ARDS1.gif)](/books/NBK436002/figure/article-17172.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK436002/figure/article-17172.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Image courtesy S Bhimji MD [![This is a chest radiograph of a preterm neonate with respiratory distress syndrome showing diffuse ground glass haziness bilaterally with air bronchograms](/books/NBK436002/bin/RDS-xray__statpearls.gif)](/books/NBK436002/figure/article-17172.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK436002/figure/article-17172.image.f2/?report=objectonly) This is a chest radiograph of a preterm neonate with respiratory distress syndrome showing diffuse ground glass haziness bilaterally with air bronchograms.
