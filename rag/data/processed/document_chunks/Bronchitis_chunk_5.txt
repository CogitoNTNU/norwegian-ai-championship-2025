clinically, relying on a comprehensive assessment encompassing a medical history, pulmonary examination, and other pertinent physical findings. The evaluation of oxygen saturation, along with the assessment of pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate, serves as a pivotal indicator for gauging the severity of the condition. In cases where vital signs fall within normal ranges and no physical examination findings suggest pneumonia, further diagnostic investigations are generally unnecessary. However, an exception to this rule applies to older patients (>75 years) or individuals with neurocognitive impairment. In such instances, a more extensive workup should be considered part of the evaluation process. Chest x-ray (CXR) findings in cases of acute bronchitis are generally nonspecific and often appear normal. The CXR findings may occasionally reveal increased interstitial markings indicative of bronchial wall thickening. A CXR proves particularly valuable in distinguishing pneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are present. Evidence-based guidelines established by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR where specific criteria are met, including the following:[14] - Heart rate exceeding 100 bpm - Respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min - Oral body temperature surpassing 38 Â°C - Chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus Laboratory testing, including a complete blood count and chemistry panel, may be conducted as part of the diagnostic workup for fever. The white blood count might show a mild elevation in some cases of acute bronchitis. Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach. Some of these circumstances include: - Influenza season: During the influenza season, rapid testing for influenza may be recommended in specific patient populations. This population includes individuals at a heightened risk of complications, such as older individuals, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. Healthcare workers who develop respiratory symptoms may also benefit from rapid testing to determine the presence of influenza and assess the appropriateness of the antiviral treatment. - Viral pandemics: In the context of viral pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid testing becomes essential for diagnosing and managing the infection. Swift identification of cases is imperative for promptly implementing appropriate infection control measures, timely administration of treatment, and prevention of further viral transmission. - High suspicion of pertussis or bacterial infections: When a strong clinical suspicion of
