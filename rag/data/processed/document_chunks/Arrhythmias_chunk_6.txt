Degree AV Block: Caused by increased vagal tone or conduction impairment or due to medications. Signs & Symptoms: Generally asymptomatic but can cause dizziness. EKG Findings: PR interval is greater than 200 milliseconds. Management: Usually, no need to treat. b) Second Degree AV Block: Further classified into Mobitz I block, where there is a progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a skipped beat, and Mobitz II block, where there is a randomly dropped QRS complex on an EKG. Sign & Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, syncope. EKG Findings: Mobitz type I shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex or dropped beat. Mobitz type II has randomly dropped QRS complexes. Management: Pacemaker is indicated in symptomatic Mobitz I and all of Mobitz II heart block. c) Third Degree or complete AV Block Mechanism: Lack of conduction of atrial impulse to ventricle leading to independent contractions. Sign & Symptoms: Profound bradycardia, hypotension, and can lead to asystole and cardiac arrest. EKG Findings: Bradycardia, P waves occur independently of QRS and Wide QRS for ventricular rhythm. Management: Pacemaker placement. **Sinus Node Dysfunction** Mechanism: Senescence of the SA node, an ischemic event involving the SA node leading to impulse generation at a slower rate. a) Sinus Pause: When the SA node has delayed impulse generation. b) Sinus Arrest: Failure of impulse generation. c) SA Nodal Exit Block: Failure of impulse transmission. Sign & Symptoms: Bradycardia, dizziness, palpitation, or syncope. EKG Findings: P wave not originating at a determined rate with regularity Management: Symptomatic patients require pacemaker placement. ## Other Issues **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy** Mechanism: Subaortic outflow tract obstruction from abnormal hypertrophy of the septal region of the heart, leading to precipitation of ventricular arrhythmias. Risk Factor: Autosomal dominant mutation in the gene coding for cardiac sarcomere(Beta myosin heavy chain). Suspect this in a patient with a family history of sudden cardiac death in 2 first-degree relatives. Symptoms: Syncope with exertion, palpitation, develops early heart failure symptoms. Treatment: Beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy. Surgery is indicated for patients with obstructive physiology with an outflow gradient greater than 50 mmHg. The defibrillator is indicated for patients who are symptomatic post maximal medical therapy, abnormal systolic blood pressure response to exercise, septal thickness > 30 mm, runs of ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation on telemetry or during the stress test.
