including the use of aggressive immunotherapies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Clear communication with an emphasis on discussing the uncertain nature of the diagnosis, treatment options available, and possible outcomes; should be maintained with the patient’s family throughout the course of the disease. Palliative care services can be consulted early during the hospital course to offer support to the family members and facilitate care discussion goals should the need arise. They can play an essential role in building a strong relationship between the patient’s family and the health care teams. Physicians should encourage families to participate in the national registry for NORSE patients (www.norseinstitute.org/norse-registry-2) to promote clinical research with an aim to understand possible causes of NORSE, identify best treatment options and hence improve patient outcomes. Overall, an interprofessional healthcare team approach to managing NORSE will yield the best patient outcomes. This team is comprised of clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, working collaboratively with open communication lines to achieve the best possible care standard.
