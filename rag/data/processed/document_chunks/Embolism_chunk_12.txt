3 - Other diagnoses less likely than pulmonary embolism: 3 - Heart rate >100 bpm: 1.5 - Immobilization for ≥3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks: 1.5 - Previous history of DVT or PE: 1.5 - Hemoptysis: 1 - Malignancy: 1 [61] Using the traditional or modified Wells criteria, the clinical probability of PE in a patient can be calculated using the following scores: - Traditional Wells criteria - High: >6 - Moderate: 2 to 6 - Low: \<2 - Modified Wells criteria - PE likely: >4 - PE unlikely: ≤4 **Pulmonary Embolism Exclusion Criteria** Since PE symptoms are very nonspecific, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) was developed for emergency department patients to select patients with a low likelihood of having PE that diagnostic workup should not be initiated.[62] They constitute variables significantly associated with the absence of PE. The PERC rule contains the following 8 criteria: - Age \<50 years - Heart rate \<100 bpm - Oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥95% - No hemoptysis - No estrogen use - No prior DVT or PE - No unilateral leg swelling - No surgery/trauma requiring hospitalization within the preceding 4 weeks For patients who fulfill all 8 criteria having a low probability of PE, the likelihood of PE is sufficiently low that further testing is not indicated. PERC is only valid in clinical settings with a low prevalence of PE (\<15%).[63] In hospital settings with a higher prevalence of PE (>15%), the PERC-based approach has substantially weaker predictive value.[64] Therefore, PERC criteria should not be used in patients with an intermediate or high suspicion of PE or inpatients suspected of having PE. **Pulmonary Embolism Diagnostic Evaluation Approach in Hemodynamically Stable Patients** An approach that combines clinical and pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and definitive diagnostic imaging is usually applied for most hemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE.[51] **Low probability of pulmonary embolus (Wells score** **< 2)** If PERC criteria are fulfilled, further testing is unneeded, and PE can be excluded. If PERC criteria are not met, then a D-dimer should be obtained. If D-dimer is negative, PE can be ruled out (\<500 ng/mL). CT pulmonary angiography should be performed if the D-dimer is positive (>500 ng/mL) in patients aged \<50 or higher after the age-adjusted D-dimer value. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, a V/Q scan should be performed. For a patient with an intermediate probability of PE (Wells score
