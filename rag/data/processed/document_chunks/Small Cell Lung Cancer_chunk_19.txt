IV IVA - Any T / Any N M1a or M1b IV B - Any T / Any N M1c Staging for all Small Cell Lung Cancer - SCLC staging can be done using the TNM system, but since SCLC is considered a systemic disease, a more straightforward classification has been used successfully since the 1950s. There is a growing body of evidence that TNM rating may better define SCLC, but there is no consensus on this approach yet. - SCLC is classified as LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC small cell based on the Veterans Affairs Lung study group (VALSG) classification. - LS-SCLC is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax and local lymph nodes, both mediastinal and hilar and supraclavicular nodes can be included in a single tolerable radiotherapy port (corresponding to TNM stages I through IIIB). - ES-SCLC has tumors beyond the boundaries of limited disease, including distant metastases, malignant pericardial or pleural effusions, and contralateral supraclavicular and contralateral hilar involvement.[14] ## Prognosis **Prognosis of NSCLC** The TNM stage at presentation in patients with NSCLC has the most significant impact on prognosis. A higher TNM stage correlates with advanced disease and poor outcomes. Other factors indicative of poor prognosis include performance status at the time of diagnosis, anorexia, weight loss, and the presence of liver or skin metastases.[42] Molecular studies have revealed that patients with activating mutations of EGFR in patients with adenocarcinoma have a better prognosis than those without EGFR mutations.[43] **Prognosis of SCLC** The extent of disease and the stage at presentation is the most important prognostic factor for SCLC. Patients with the limited-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 10 to 13%, whereas patients with the extensive-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 1 to 2%.[44] Similar to NSCLC, performance status and weight loss are independent prognostic factors for SCLC, where patients with poor performance status and/or weight loss at the time of diagnosis have a decreased survival rate. ## Complications Complications of lung cancer such as thrombosis and paraneoplastic syndromes are discussed above. Common complications seen in patients undergoing treatment for lung cancer include: - Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting - Fatigue - Anorexia - Weight loss - Anemia - Neutropenia - Nephrotoxicity (especially in patients receiving cisplatin-based therapies) - Neurotoxicities ## Deterrence and Patient Education The single most important preventive measure is smoking cessation in all individuals. Patients should be advised about the clinical correlation of
