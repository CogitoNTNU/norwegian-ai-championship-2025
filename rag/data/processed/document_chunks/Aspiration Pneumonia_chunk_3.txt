Japan is approximately.[2] In patients under 80, an aspiration event leads to pneumonia only 5% of the time, whereas patients older than 80 develop pneumonia 10% of the time following such an event. Notably, among nursing home residents diagnosed with pneumonia, 18% to 30% of cases are associated with an aspiration event.[3] It is imperative to recognize that not all aspiration events result in pneumonia. For instance, in cases involving anesthesia, up to 64% of instances did not exhibit any clinical or radiological signs of infection following aspiration events.[4] ## Pathophysiology Aspiration pneumonia occurs when bacteria-rich fluid from the oropharynx or upper GI tract is aspirated into the lungs in sufficient quantities to overcome protective physiologic mechanisms against infection. Intact swallow and cough reflexes prevent aspiration in adequate amounts to produce pneumonia. However, impaired swallow or cough reflexes permit aspirated material to reach the alveoli, causing infection. Even small amounts of aspirated secretions can incite infection in patients with a high bacterial load.[1] Notably, overt aspiration events often go unnoticed, with microaspiration, or silent aspiration, central to the pathophysiological mechanism underlying aspiration pneumonia.[2] While the bacterial load in microaspirations may be minimal, recurrent microaspirations can progressively lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia over time due to repetitive epithelial injury caused by frequent aspiration events that denude the pulmonary epithelium. Ultimately, the mucociliary transport mechanism and the macrophage-dependent clearance of aspirated material become compromised. In individuals with compromised immunity, subsequent exposure to aspirated organisms in the alveolar space precipitates infection.[4] Various interacting mechanisms can contribute to impaired swallowing. In older adults, diminished pharyngeal sensory perception for swallowing and coughing significantly influence impaired swallowing. Additionally, asynchronous breathing patterns during swallowing, characterized by inhalation instead of exhalation, can lead to aspiration. Other predisposing factors include reduced saliva production, ineffective dentition, and delayed laryngeal closure. Furthermore, with aging, the upper esophageal sphincter may decrease in cross-sectional area, resulting in more significant amounts of pharyngeal residue and increasing the risk of aspiration.[1] In the absence of infection, lung fluid is typically considered sterile. However, recent advancements in culture-independent molecular techniques have identified the lung microbiome, which shares many microbes with the normal flora of the oropharynx. A disequilibrium of oropharyngeal bacterial communities is thought to contribute to decreased lung resistance to colonization and a diminished ability to contain potential pathogens. This notion is supported by the predominance of aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens as the leading
