to the cervical spine arises. A capillary blood glucose level should be checked in any patient presenting with an unknown cause of lethargy or loss of consciousness, even if an overdose is highly suspected. Initial treatment of overdose starts with supportive care, including assistance with respiration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the absence of spontaneous circulation, and removal of any opioid agent, such as a patch or infusion. Naloxone should be administered immediately when an opioid overdose is suspected as the cause of respiratory and CNS depression, without delay for laboratory studies. **Naloxone administration** Naloxone is a pure competitive antagonist of opiate receptors and has no agonistic activity. The drug is relatively safe and may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or endotracheally, though research on tracheal absorption has been conducted only in animal models. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an intranasal formulation commonly used by first responders in patients without intravenous access. Intranasal naloxone is also available to the community.[31] After naloxone administration, the onset of action occurs within minutes, regardless of the route. A second dose may be given every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed by 3 to 10 minutes. The goal of naloxone administration is to restore adequate breathing and ensure a stable airway. Higher doses are required for patients who overdosed on diphenoxylate, methadone, butorphanol, nalbuphine, or pentazocine. A naloxone infusion can be started in patients who need repeated doses to maintain respiration. Nalmefene is a new agent on the market that can reverse opiate toxicity. This drug has a half-life of 4 to 8 hours. However, routine use of this longer-acting opiate antagonist is not recommended due to concerns about precipitating a prolonged period of opiate withdrawal. **Starting dose of naloxone** The usual starting dose of naloxone for adults ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg. Meanwhile, the starting dose for children is 0.1 mg/kg. The goal of naloxone administration is to reverse respiratory depression, not to "wake up" the individual. Naloxone should be administered slowly in suspected chronic opiate users, with doses of 0.04 to 0.4 mg given intravenously every 1 to 3 minutes. This approach ensures a more controlled reversal of opiate effects and reduces the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.[32] Rapid administration of naloxone in these patients can trigger withdrawal, which is distressing for the patient and potentially places healthcare workers at risk
