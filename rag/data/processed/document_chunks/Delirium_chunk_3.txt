and illness. Some changes associated with age include decreased brain blood perfusion, increased neuron loss, and changes in the proportion of stress-regulating neurotransmitters. **Neuroinflammation** Peripheral inflammatory insults damage endothelial cell-cell adhesions at the blood-brain barrier. The increased endothelial permeability promotes inflammation in the central nervous system, causing further damage, ischemia, and neuronal death. **Reactive Oxidation Species** Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are mediators of cellular damage. The central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to reactive oxygen species due to its high lipid content and low antioxidant capacity. **Circadian Rhythm Dysregulation** Disruption in sleep duration and architecture and melatonin secretion leads to dysfunction of many systems. Melatonin affects many functions in the central nervous system, including regulation of sleep-wake cycles, glucose regulation, core body temperature, antioxidant defenses, and immune system response. **Neurotransmitter Imbalance** Delirium is associated with decreased acetylcholine and increased dopamine activity. The brain's dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways overlap, and their balance is vital to brain function. **Neuroendocrine** Increased glucocorticoid release in response to physiologic stress increases the vulnerability of neurons to subsequent damage and impacts the regulation of gene transcription, cellular signaling, and glial cell behavior.[3] ## History and Physical Delirium is a potential indicator of a life-threatening illness, and every episode of delirium should be appropriately evaluated. The evaluation involves taking a thorough history, a complete physical exam, laboratory tests, and possible imaging. The test selections should be based on information obtained from the history and physical examination, considering that delirium is often multifactorial in etiology and can be influenced by several predisposing factors, precipitating factors, or both. Delirium is often referred to in 3 main manifestations. 1. Hyperactive Delirium: Patients present with increased agitation and sympathetic activity. They can present with hallucinations, delusions, and occasionally combative or uncooperative behavior. 1. Hypoactive Delirium: Patients have increased somnolence and decreased arousal. Hypoactive delirium is dangerous as it is often unrecognized or mistaken for fatigue or depression. It is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 1. Mixed Presentation: Patients can fluctuate between Hyperactive and Hypoactive presentations.[3] Delirium is defined by the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition) and includes the presence of all of the following criteria: - Disturbance in attention and awareness develops acutely and tends to fluctuate in severity. - At least one additional disturbance in cognition - Disturbances are not better explained by preexisting dementia. - Disturbances do not
