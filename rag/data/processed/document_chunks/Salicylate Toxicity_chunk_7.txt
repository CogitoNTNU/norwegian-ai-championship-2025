impaired concentration and memory.[38] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes MDMA toxicity can be life-threatening and involve multiple organ systems, necessitating an interprofessional approach. Providers need to be prepared to treat potential toxicities because treatment is mainly supportive. This requires an interprofessional team approach to managing toxicity, including education, interventions, monitoring, and follow-up from all disciplines, particularly emergency clinicians, toxicology specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. By coordinating activities and sharing information, the patient is more likely to achieve successful short- and long-term outcomes. The most effective solution to the issue at hand is prevention. According to existing literature, MDMA use is often motivated by curiosity, availability, affordability, and a desire to enhance mood and social interaction due to social influence.[39] It is crucial to educate vulnerable populations about the harmful effects of MDMA to reduce its usage. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=30349&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=30349) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/addiction/34-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-mdma-toxicity-ecstasy-molly-overdose/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=30349) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/30349/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=30349) ## References 1.
