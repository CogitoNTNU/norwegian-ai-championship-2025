trauma.[16] Multiple medications have been implicated in drug-induced pericarditis, although its incidence remains rare. Historically, certain drugs such as procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid have been associated with medication-induced SLE, leading to serositis and pericardial involvement manifesting as pericarditis.[18] More recently, checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab have been increasingly recognized as causes of cardiac toxicity, including myocarditis and pericarditis. The 2 most prominent classes of medications are monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) along with its ligand PD-L1. These therapies have seen numerous advancements in oncology and are likely to be implicated in more cases of cardiac toxicity as their clinical use continues to rise.[19] Miscellaneous conditions, such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, should also be considered, particularly when pericarditis is accompanied by suggestive systemic findings.[20] However, in up to 90% of cases, no clear etiology is identified, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic acute pericarditis. This form is the most commonly encountered in clinical practice, and extensive testing is rarely necessary unless there is specific clinical suspicion. ## Epidemiology Acute pericarditis is a prevalent form of pericardial disease and a common cause of chest pain. This condition often occurs in trauma patients, those with uremia, and individuals with malignant diseases, with a higher incidence in men.[21] ## Pathophysiology The pericardium serves several functions, including anchoring the heart within the thoracic cavity, forming a barrier against extrinsic infections, and facilitating dynamic interaction between cardiac chambers.[2] Notably, the pericardium is not necessary for survival, as cases have been reported of congenital complete absence of the pericardium, which has been incidentally discovered in asymptomatic individuals.[22] Despite potential concerns about increased cardiac mobility and displacement within the chest cavity, studies show these patients have comparable left ventricular ejection fraction and life expectancy to the general population.[23] The parietal layer’s rich innervation makes it highly sensitive to inflammation caused by infectious, autoimmune, or traumatic insults, often resulting in severe retrosternal chest pain, as seen in acute pericarditis.[1] This explains why over 90% of patients with pericarditis present with chest discomfort.[3] In cases of pericardial effusion, increased pericardial compliance allows the sac to dilate over time in response to slowly accumulating fluid, preventing compression of the cardiac chambers.[2] Consequently, the rate of fluid accumulation—and the resulting pressure changes—often has a greater impact than the volume in determining the hemodynamic effects on the heart. As a result, a
