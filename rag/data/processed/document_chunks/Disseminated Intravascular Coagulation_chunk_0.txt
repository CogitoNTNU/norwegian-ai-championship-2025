Commonly, life-threatening illnesses accompany disseminated intravascular coagulation, presenting a challenge in diagnosis and management. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation and provides guidance on identifying underlying causes and implementing appropriate treatments tailored to individual patients. Additionally, the significance of recognizing disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill patients is highlighted, as its presence significantly impacts mortality rates, particularly in conjunction with sepsis or severe trauma. Further, this activity emphasizes the importance of an interprofessional approach to caring for affected patients. Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures timely diagnosis, appropriate management, and ongoing monitoring, thereby enhancing the quality of care and outcomes for patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation. - Assess the clinical manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation. - Implement management considerations for disseminated intravascular coagulation. - Explain the importance of utilizing an interprofessional team to manage patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

As this process begins consuming clotting factors and platelets in a positive feedback loop, hemorrhage can ensue, which may be the presenting symptom of a patient with DIC. Disseminated intravascular coagulation typically occurs as an acute complication in patients with underlying life-threatening illnesses such as severe sepsis, hematologic malignancies, severe trauma, or placental abruption. Determining the consequences of DIC and the overall mortality rate of DIC remains difficult as patients with this condition also have additional diagnoses that can cause many of the signs and symptoms consistent with DIC, particularly if they also have acute or chronic liver failure. While concomitant disease states can obscure a patientâ€™s prognosis, mortality rates have been shown
