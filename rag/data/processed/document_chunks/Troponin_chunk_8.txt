polyreactive against heterogeneous, poorly defined antigens of different chemical compositions; they generally show low affinity and weak binding.[81] Natural or autoimmune rheumatoid factor (RF) accounts for most heterophile interference in immunoassays. Interfering endogenous antibodies are called heterophile antibodies when there is no clearly defined immunogen, and the antibody reacts with immunoglobulin from two or more species or has RF activity.[82] In the case of RF, false positives arise by binding RF to the Fc-constant domain of antigen-antibody complexes if the detection antibody is labeled anti-human IgG. The presence of RF in serum can cause false positives in troponin assays. Antibody Fab fragments may prevent interference mediated by the Fc part of intact antibodies.[83] Human anti-animal antibodies (HAAA) are high-affinity, specific, polyclonal antibodies produced against a specific animal immunogen whole immunoglobulin of IgG or IgM class.[84] They show strong binding with antigens of a single chemical composition. They are produced in a high titer such that they compete with the test antigen by cross-reacting with reagent antibodies of the same species to produce a false signal. HAAA are most commonly human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) but also include antibodies to rabbits, goats, sheep, and others.[85] As with any assay employing mouse antibodies, the possibility exists of interference by HAMA.[86] One stimulus that is increasingly responsible for HAMA production is mouse monoclonal antibodies used in diagnostic image analysis and immune-directed therapy.[87] A large percentage (41%) of patients treated with radiolabeled mouse monoclonal antibodies developed HAMA within a few weeks of treatment.[88] Apart from false-positive results, heterophile antibodies can cause falsely low results if they bind to the variable regions of the capture antibody, mimicking the antigen to be measured and preventing troponin from binding.[89] The most commonly used technique for minimizing the impact of HAMA on commercial immunoassays is the addition of non-immune mouse immunoglobulin (IgG). This IgG should neutralize the more frequently encountered HAMA.[90] Steps the laboratory can take to evaluate this possibility include using a larger dilution of the sample with a reagent containing the non-immune mouse IgG or performing the analysis on a differently configured assay, preferably one employing different species of reagent antibodies.[91] Autoantibodies also have the potential to cause interference in troponin immunometric assay methods. False-positive or false-negative values may arise, depending on whether the autoantibody-analyte complex partitions into the free or the bound analyte fraction.[92] Bohner et al. reported a false-negative cTnI due to a circulating autoantibody,
