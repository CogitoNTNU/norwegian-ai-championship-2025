invasive ventilation.[24] ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions Mechanical ventilation requires a collaborative, interprofessional approach to ensure optimal outcomes. Critical care nurses and respiratory therapists are pivotal in continuously monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings. These professionals must be familiar with interpreting ABG results and understanding the physiological implications of pH, PaCO2, and PaO2 changes. Their expertise in making real-time adjustments to basic ventilator settings based on ABG results is essential to maintaining optimal gas exchange and preventing complications. Moreover, critical care clinicians and advanced nursing healthcare professionals provide oversight and make high-level decisions regarding ventilator management. Implementing safety protocols to prevent ventilator-associated complications such as barotrauma, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity is vital. Regular training on ventilator management and simulation exercises can help healthcare teams stay proficient in emergency procedures and routine adjustments. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines for adjusting ventilator parameters based on ABG results ensures that patient care is both effective and up-to-date. Continuous professional development and staying in line with the latest research in ventilator management are necessary for all team members.[25] ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring Effective monitoring of patients on mechanical ventilation requires a collaborative approach among nurses, respiratory therapists, and critical care clinicians These team members must continuously assess and respond to changes in patient status and ventilator parameters, using their expertise to interpret ABG results and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.[26] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=161107&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=161107) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/161107/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=161107) ## References 1.
