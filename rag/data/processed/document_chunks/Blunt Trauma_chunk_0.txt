Hearing loss from AAT results from the blastâ€™s impact and the rapid expansion of gases. AAT often results from mechanical and metabolic injuries to the auditory system, causing symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, otalgia, vertigo, and hyperacusis. AAT is distinct from noise-induced hearing loss, which develops gradually due to prolonged exposure to noise levels of 100 to 120 dBA, often found in workplaces or combat zones. Although AAT is prevalent among military personnel, it is frequently underdiagnosed in civilians due to underreporting. Healthcare providers face challenges in effectively diagnosing and managing AAT. The management strategy begins with advanced hearing protection devices; audiometric evaluations are essential before and after exposure. Prompt intervention can often prevent permanent hearing loss from hazardous noise exposure. Accurate diagnosis relies on audiometric evaluation and timely otolaryngology referral, especially for complications such as tympanic membrane perforation or facial nerve involvement. Treatment emphasizes hearing protection and managing ear trauma, while noise safety education and regular audiometric evaluations are essential for preventing permanent hearing loss. This activity reviews the characteristics, causes, diagnosis, management, and prevention of loud noise-induced injuries. This activity provides healthcare professionals with the knowledge and tools to deliver optimal patient care, including insights into the psychoacoustics of loudness, active and passive hearing protection methods, and the role of medical and surgical interventions in treating AAT. **Objectives:** - Identify the signs and symptoms of acute acoustic trauma, including sudden sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. - Implement appropriate audiometric evaluations and otomicroscopy to diagnose acute acoustic trauma promptly. - Apply evidence-based management strategies, including the use of hearing protection devices and timely referrals to otolaryngologists. - Collaborate with multidisciplinary healthcare teams, including audiologists and occupational health specialists, to develop comprehensive care plans for patients with acute acoustic trauma.
