to review. Assessment from the previous spine imaging helps decide the optimum puncture level of the procedure. Recent surgical scar or nearby infection precludes LP at that site. Prior spine imaging avoids spinal stenosis levels, which can cause more pain. Prior lumbar spine imaging helps estimate the skin to thecal sac distance, though generally decreases cranially. If lumbar processes are not palpable, then the regular 3.5-inch needle may not be sufficient. To estimate the appropriate needle length approximately predicts the skin-canal disease (inches) = 0.077 x BMI + 0.88.[10] It is often helpful if another person can gently compress the soft tissues on the back to reduce the skin-thecal sac distance. ## Technique or Treatment Adequate positioning of the patient is essential to make the patient comfortable and for the interventionist to perform the procedure safely. Many patients referred for the FGLP are generally hospitalized and have several comorbidities, and it is difficult for them to maintain still for a longer duration. In addition, many of them can have difficulty breathing or arm pain in certain positions. **Prone Approach:** The patient should lie prone on the fluoroscopy table. Pillows straighten the lumbar lordosis when placed below the stomach. It also increases the interspinous distance, often narrowed due to degeneration. Secondly, it flattens the extra adipose tissue over the back and allows a shorter needle in most patients. A regular AP radiograph of the lumbar spine obtained before the procedure provides details of degenerative disease. Additionally, it is helpful to tilt the tube cranially by 10-15 degrees to align with the spinous process, mainly in older patients who have a reduced inter-spinous distance by degenerative disease. The prone position allows keeping the needle hub directly over the needle tip. It removes the parallax. A cross-table lateral view can confirm the depth and trajectory of the needle if a biplane camera is not available. **Prone Oblique Approach:** The patient in the oblique lateral position and the spinous processes are not midline. The inter-laminar and inter-spinous spaces appear wider than in the prone approach. Many radiologists favor this approach as patients with comorbidities better tolerate this position; however, the trajectory of the needle is difficult to assess on the lateral view. **Lateral Approach:** A lateral decubitus position is a preferred position**i** f the patient can't lie on their stomach because of obesity, backache, respiratory discomfort, shoulder pain, or medical conditions such as high
