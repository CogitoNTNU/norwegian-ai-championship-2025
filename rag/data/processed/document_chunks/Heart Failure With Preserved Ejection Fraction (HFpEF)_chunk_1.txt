These impairments prohibit the ventricle from either filling with or ejecting blood.[1] The signs and symptoms of heart failure, particularly dyspnea, fatigue, and congestion, are demonstrative of the most current definition of heart failureâ€”"an inability of the heart to pump blood to the body commensurate with its needs, or to so do only at the cost of increased filling pressures."[1][2] Heart failure is a significant public health issue; the incidence and prevalence of heart failure are increasing in the United States and across the globe. Additionally, heart failure is the end stage of many disease processes, and the risk of developing heart failure increases with increasing age.[3] Heart failure is frequently a progressive disease process, and progression is associated with decreased survival, regardless of underlying etiology.[1][4] To underline these risks and the progression of disease, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have described and defined the following stages of heart failure: - **Stage A: At Risk for Heart Failure** - patients at risk for heart failure without symptoms, structural heart disease, or cardiac biomarkers of (ventricular) stretch or injury. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to modify underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure. - **Stage B: Pre-Heart Failure** - patients with evidence of increased filling pressures by invasive or noninvasive methods or patients with risk factors and increased biomarkers of stretch or cardiac injury that are not explained by other disease processes. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to treat risk and structural heart disease to prevent heart failure. - **Stage C: Symptomatic Heart Failure** - patients with structural heart disease with current or previous symptoms of heart failure. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality. - **Stage D: Advanced Heart Failure** - patients with marked symptoms of heart failure that interfere with daily life and with recurrent hospitalizations despite attempts to optimize guideline-directed medical therapy. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.[1] Separate from the ACC/AHA Stage of Heart Failure is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure. This classification is a subjective assessment by a clinician to characterize the functional capacity and symptoms of patients with ACC/AHA stage C or D
