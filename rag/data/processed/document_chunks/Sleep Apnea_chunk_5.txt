has decreased the number of apneic episodes during sleep times for patients with CHF. It also improved NYHA functional class quality of life, and EF was noted at the end of 12-week in patients with central sleep apnea.[28] These findings were confirmed over 52 weeks in a similar trial, ensuring improved quality of life.[29] Unilateral placement of phrenic nerve stimulators is another treatment option for patients with central sleep apnea. A recent study suggested that such therapy was associated with decreased disease severity and improved quality of life. It also resulted in significant improvement in the arousal index, improved quality of life, and a decreased self-reported daytime sleepiness. These benefits were independent of heart failure status.[30] Peripheral nerve stimulation works by restoring the normal physiological mechanics of breathing. Different pharmacological agents have been studied as a potential treatment for central sleep apnea. However, these medications remain investigational, and there is no approved pharmacological treatment for CSA. Hypnotics such as triazolam and zolpidem can reduce wakefulness and unstable sleep.[31] These medications may lead to increased total sleep, decreased central apnea index, and a decrease in brief arousals.[31] Respiratory stimulants such as acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, work by causing mild metabolic acidosis, resulting in increased respiratory drive decreases the frequency of central apneas.[32] Recently, other medications such as Buspirone [33]and Mirtazapine have been studied.[33][34] Both drugs reduced the susceptibility to developing hypocapnic central apnea in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Theophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptors antagonist, has been used in the context of central sleep apneas in patients with heart failure, and the benefit may be attributed to inhibition of adenosine receptors located in the medulla leading to increasing ventilatory stimulation.[35] A recent experimental study demonstrated that selective adenosine A1 receptor blockade could alleviate the cervical spinal cord injury model.[36] ## Differential Diagnosis The number of conditions must be considered and ruled out before establishing the diagnosis of central sleep apnea because of the characteristics of some of these diseases to cause excessive daytime sleepiness along with other symptoms that might contribute to the disruption of sleep. These conditions include: - Obstructive sleep apnea - Periodic limb movements of sleep - Narcolepsy - Obstructive and restrictive lung diseases - Patients with neuromuscular disease - Night shift workers and people who have variable sleep routines/patterns ## Prognosis Heart failure patients with CSA and CSB tend to have a worse prognosis, and treatment
