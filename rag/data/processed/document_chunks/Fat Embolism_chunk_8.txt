practice because of the potential risk of bleeding. There has not been a proven clinical benefit with heparin in FES. Therapy with corticosteroids has been proposed for the treatment of FES based on the following effects: - Inhibition of complement-activated leucocyte aggregation - Limiting FFA level - Membrane stabilization A meta-analysis of 7 randomized control trials using corticosteroid prophylaxis showed a close to 77% reduction in the risk for FES in a patient with a long bone fracture. However, there is no difference in mortality, infection, or avascular necrosis between the treatment group and the control group. For this reason, the use of corticosteroids is still very controversial. **Inferior Vena Cava Filter** This has been proposed as a measure to prevent the showering of fat emboli. However, placing an inferior vena cava filter has not been studied sufficiently as a prophylactic treatment for FES. **Operative Measures** It is highly recommended that early open reduction and internal fixation of long bone fractures be started. The incidence of FES is higher in a patient with long bone fractures who are managed conservatively. Using internal fixation devices in managing long bone fractures significantly reduces the incidence of FES. During operative fixation of the long bone fracture, care must be taken to limit the intramedullary pressure, as high pressure is associated with increased fat emboli entering the systemic circulation. Some techniques utilized in orthopedic surgery to reduce embolization include: - Lavage of bone marrow before fixation - Venting of the femoral bone - Drilling of small holes in the cortex of the bone to lower intramedullary pressure None of these maneuvers has been shown to reduce FES. **Supportive Care** Once a patient develops FES, this is the mainstay treatment. Supportive care is geared toward adequately oxygenating the end organs. **Goals of Supportive Care** - Provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation - Maintenance of adequate hemodynamic stability - Transfusion of packed red blood cells to improve oxygen delivery if indicated - Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis with a sequential compression device - Adequate nutrition and hydration Supplemental oxygen might be required, and if the patient develops fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome, intubation, and mechanical ventilation might be required. **Albumin** Albumin is recommended as part of the resuscitation tools for hypovolemia. It restores intravascular volume and helps to bind free fatty acids. This prevents the systemic dissemination of fat globules. **Indications for Intubation** - Altered mental
