benefit from head imaging prior to discharge. If CT imaging is not available, one can consider observing for at least 4 to 6 hours if no imaging was obtained. One should consider hospitalization if any of these other risk factors are present: - Bleeding disorder - Patients taking anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy - Previous neurosurgical procedure It is imperative to provide strict return precautions for patients discharged without imaging. A study of metabolomics and microRNAs can help predict the need for a CT scan of the head among these cohorts.[21][44] Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) compared six biomarkers (S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament light, and total tau) with four clinical decision rules (the Canadian CT head rule, the CT in Head injury Patients, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for head injury, and New Orleans criteria).[21] The study revealed that Glial fibrillary acidic protein demonstrated superior performance compared to other biomarkers in distinguishing the necessity for CT scans among individuals with mild head injuries. It exhibited a 99% probability of more effectively identifying CT-positive patients than the clinical characteristics utilized in current decision-making frameworks.[21] Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee advocates CT imaging among cohorts with minimal head injury presenting with the following clinical characteristics: - Loss of consciousness and repeated vomiting alongside increased S100B assay - Seizures, neurological deficits, and clinical evidence of depressed or skull base fractures - Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation or having bleeding disorders - Age >65 years and on antiplatelet medications - This minimizes health costs, radiation hazards, and emergency overcrowding without compromising patients' safety.[45] **Moderate to Severe Head Trauma** Prehospital and ED care should prioritize on: - Stabilization of physiological parameters as per the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support - Rapid correction of impaired coagulation - Noninvasive techniques to monitor ICP - Emergent surgical evacuation of mass lesions or decompressive craniectomy and - Temporary measures to counteract ICP [46] Current recommendations include: - Optimizing Oxygenation (SpO2 >90%), blood pressure (SBP >110 mm Hg), and maintaining euthermia. Prehospital guidelines of the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend intubation with a GCS of 8 or less, while the CENTER-TBI advocates in-hospital intubation with a GCS of 10 or lower.[21] Maintaining euthermia may help prevent coagulopathy and infection associated with hypothermia, as well as increased metabolic demand and energy failure associated with hyperthermia. -
