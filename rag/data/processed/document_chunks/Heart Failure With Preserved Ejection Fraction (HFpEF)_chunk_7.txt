peak exercise.[44] While oxygen transport and utilization are impaired in all patients with HFpEF regardless of the degree of exercise intolerance, exact impairments vary among patients, and underlying comorbidities strongly influence impairment.[45][42] While the cellular mechanisms contributing to HFpEF remain ill-defined, the result of cellular and tissue pathophysiologic processes is structural remodeling of the left ventricle, a subsequent decrease in left ventricular reserve, abnormal hemodynamics, and the secondary organ dysfunction that causes the clinical syndrome of HFpEF.[2] Historically, HFpEF was thought to present in patients with concentric ventricular remodeling; recent studies have demonstrated that HFpEF may be observed in patients with any form of cardiac remodeling, and many patients with HFpEF have normal ventricular structure.[46] Despite the heterogeneity of left ventricular structure, the most prominent hemodynamic finding in patients with HFpEF is elevated LVFPs.[2] Patients in the early stages of HFpEF have normal LVFPs at rest, and elevations only occur with exercise.[47][39] As the disease progresses, elevations in LVFPs are observed at rest.[39] These elevations in LVFPs are the result of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction secondary to incomplete myocardial relaxation, increased ventricular stiffness with subsequent decreased ventricular distensibility, and a shift in the Frank-Starling mechanism initially during exercise and eventually at rest.[48][49][50] Elevations in LVFPs, even when inconsistent, induce structural remodeling of the left atrium. Significant differences in left atrial structure and function exist between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF; left atrial function is more closely correlated with outcomes in HFpEF.[10] Compared to patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF have smaller left atrial volumes. However, patients with HFpEF have increased left atrial peak pressures, stiffness, and wall stress and are more likely to have atrial fibrillation.[10] Atrial fibrillation further exacerbates the remodeling and dysfunction of the left atrium, which increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension.[51] The development of pulmonary hypertension significantly increases the risk of death in patients with HFpEF.[52] The development of pulmonary hypertension increases right ventricular dysfunction, and this phenomenon is increased in patients with obesity who are already at increased risk of right ventricular dysfunction.[2] Right ventricular dysfunction significantly increases the risk of death in patients with HFpEF.[36][53] Ultimately, it is this constellation of dysfunctional processes at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels that causes the clinical constellation of signs and symptoms observed in patients with HFpEF, namely exertional dyspnea progressing to dyspnea at rest, fatigue, decreased organ perfusion, pulmonary congestion, and edema.[2] ## Histopathology
