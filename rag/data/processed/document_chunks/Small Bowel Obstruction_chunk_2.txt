rarely seen but may occur in conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever and recurrent serositis.[5] The rarity of these types of SBO can result in a delay in diagnosis with complications leading to sepsis and death, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical suspicion and timely imaging for diagnosis **Hernias** Abdominal wall hernias, external (eg, inguinal or umbilical) and internal, are the second most common cause of SBO in developed countries (globally the leading cause). These hernias account for approximately 2% to 10% of cases and often require surgical intervention to relieve obstruction and prevent complications such as strangulation or ischemia. Notably, in patients with a “virgin abdomen,” abdominal wall hernias are the most frequent cause of SBO.[3] Internal hernias account for less than 1% of intestinal obstruction cases.[6] They can be congenital or acquired, and SBOs caused by these hernias are managed operatively.[7] **Malignancies and Tumors** Malignancy is the third most common cause of SBO after intraabdominal adhesions and hernias.[8] Malignant bowel obstruction, resulting from primary or metastatic cancers, accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of cases.[9] The most common primary small bowel tumors that cause SBO are adenocarcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Metastases to the small intestine are far more common than primary tumors. The small bowel is a frequent site of metastasis, particularly from tumors of the colon, pancreas, ovary, and melanoma. Other tumors involved in SBO are lymphoma, leiomyomas, and desmoid tumors. **Gallstone Ileus** A rare cause, gallstone ileus, occurs when a gallstone enters the bowel through a biliary-enteric fistula, causing obstruction, typically at the ileocecal valve. Diagnosis is based on imaging findings, including the Rigler triad: mechanical obstruction, pneumobilia, and an ectopic gallstone within the bowel lumen.[10] **Inflammatory and Infectious Conditions** Crohn disease is a significant cause of SBO, with inflammation due to active disease accounting for 5% of all SBOs.[11] Up to 80% of patients with ileal disease require surgical intervention at some point in their lives.[12] In patients with small bowel Crohn disease, one of the primary surgical indications for small bowel resection is inflammatory SBO, followed by intestinal fistula and abscess. Although many patients develop disease recurrence at the anastomosis, some develop SBO without evidence of inflammation at the transition point.[13] Endometriosis can also lead to acute SBO through inflammation or adhesions. Acute SBO secondary to intestinal endometriosis underscores the pivotal role of laparoscopic surgery in the evaluation of SBO.[14] Infectious
