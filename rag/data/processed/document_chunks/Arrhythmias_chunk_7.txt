gradient greater than 50 mmHg. The defibrillator is indicated for patients who are symptomatic post maximal medical therapy, abnormal systolic blood pressure response to exercise, septal thickness > 30 mm, runs of ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation on telemetry or during the stress test. Indications for ICD placements to prevent sudden cardiac death with arrhythmia: - CHF with EF < 35% after three months of maximal medical therapy. - Myocardial infarction (MI) with EF < 40% with inducible VT or VF in electrophysiological studies. - MI with EF < 30% - Patients with long QT if QTc > 500 and an episode of unexplained syncope or Holter showing NSVTs ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Arrhythmias can pose a diagnostic dilemma. The patient presentation can be varied even for the same arrhythmia and can require a different management approach based on the patient's clinical condition and characteristics. While clinical history, physical exam, and EKG findings may reveal particular kinds of arrhythmia, it can sometimes be challenging to form an appropriate management plan without an expert opinion. While an internist is always involved in the care of patients with arrhythmia, it is essential to consult an interprofessional team of specialists, including cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and interventionists. Based on the condition, the patient may need further evaluation with electrophysiological or ischemia workup for the cause of arrhythmia, which will eventually be treated by a cardiac catheterization or ablation procedure. The nurses are vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs, telemetry, and assist with the patient and family's education. It has been shown that hospitals with a dedicated arrhythmia team consisting of a nurse, electrophysiologist, noninvasive arrhythmia expert, and internist have shown significant improvement in the outcomes of patients.[11] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17827&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17827) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17827/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17827) [![Cardiac Electrical Conduction System](/books/NBK558923/bin/ConductionsystemoftheheartwithouttheHeart-en.svg.gif)](/books/NBK558923/figure/article-17827.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK558923/figure/article-17827.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Cardiac Electrical Conduction System.
