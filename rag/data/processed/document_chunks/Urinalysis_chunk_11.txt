significantly based on diet and lifestyle, their interpretation can be complex and often subjective. More than 90% of patients with kidney stones will exhibit at least 1 suboptimal chemical disorder. While 24-hour urine testing alone does not cure nephrolithiasis, it helps guide effective prophylactic treatment for patients committed to adhering to long-term therapeutic guidelines. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](/pubmed/29494055)," for a more detailed guide to interpreting 24-hour urine testing for kidney stone prophylaxis analysis and therapy. According to the American Urological Association guidelines, 24-hour urine testing should be offered to all patients with nephrolithiasis, regardless of symptoms. This is especially recommended for pediatric and high-risk individuals and those highly motivated to adhere to long-term prophylactic treatment recommendations.[27][28][29][30] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety Nomograms for creatinine excretion based on age, weight, sex, and sometimes ethnicity have been developed to compare expected creatinine levels in 24-hour samples, helping to assess sample validity.[10][19][21] If the sample differs by more than 30% from the expected value, it likely indicates over-collection, under-collection, or the presence of an interfering factor.[10] While expected creatinine values vary, a commonly used threshold is that less than 15 mg/kg for women and less than 20 mg/kg for men in a 24-hour collection suggests under-collection. Another validation method compares expected creatinine values with muscle mass measured by bioimpedance, as muscle mass strongly correlates with creatinine levels. However, this test is not commonly performed.[21] One formula used to calculate the expected 24-hour urine creatinine, as derived by Gerber et al, is as follows: Estimated 24-hour creatinine excretion (mg/24h)= 699 - 421.9 (if female) + (7.64 × weight [in pounds]) - 25.82 (if White) - (2.67 × age [in years]).[21][31] Urine protein-to-creatinine ratios can also be used to estimate proteinuria collected in a 24-hour urine collection. As approximately half of the proteinuria consists of uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios are often preferred to quantify abnormal urinary protein. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Microalbuminuria](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25100)" and "[Proteinuria](/pubmed/33232060)," for further information.[[43]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232060) ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes A 24-hour urinalysis is a timed urine collection used to evaluate the metabolic status of various kidney disorders and accurately quantify GFR and proteinuria. For inpatients, nurses typically collect the urine and must ensure it remains free from contaminants. In outpatient settings, patients need proper education on how to collect the urine sample accurately. Precise collections can identify treatable
