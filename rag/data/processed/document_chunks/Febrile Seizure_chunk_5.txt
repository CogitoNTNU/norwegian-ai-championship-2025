return to their baseline state. However, differential diagnoses should be considered if a patient continues to have acute neurologic impairment or symptoms (eg, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, or weakness) on an exam. During the physical exam, serial vital signs should be obtained, and findings that may suggest the underlying etiology of the fever should be noted (eg, erythematous bulging eardrums, a red pharynx, enlarged and inflamed tonsils, nuchal rigidity, bulging or tense fontanels, and Brudzinski sign). Clinicians should also perform a complete neurological examination, including a fundus examination, to assess increased intracranial pressure. Dermatologic signs that may indicate an underlying etiology should also be evaluated, such as the unilateral port-wine stain associated with Sturge–Weber syndrome, hypopigmented macules indicative of tuberous sclerosis, or café au lait spots and Lisch nodules suggestive of neurofibromatosis.[5][4] ## Evaluation Patients who have a presentation and clinical features consistent with simple febrile seizures do not need further diagnostic studies due to the benign nature of this type of febrile seizure. However, if a patient's history is consistent with a complex febrile seizure, a thorough evaluation is recommended, which usually involves ruling out any structural or infectious causes and obtaining an electroencephalogram (EEG). Laboratory studies (eg, complete blood count, complete metabolic profile, and urinalysis) should also be performed if a patient has signs of dehydration, poor fluid intake, vomiting, or diarrhea.[4] Some cases of complex febrile seizures may require hospital admission for observation and further studies.[3][18] A lumbar puncture is not necessary for a patient with simple febrile seizures and a rapid return to baseline; however, the study is recommended when there are signs or concerns of a CNS infection. A lumbar puncture should also be considered in infants presenting after a febrile seizure who are younger than12 months, not adequately immunized against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or _Haemophilus influenza_ type B, had seizure 2 days after fever onset, or taking antibiotics which may mask meningitis or other CNS infection.[5] Magnetic resonance imaging or computer tomography studies of the head for febrile seizures are not typically considered unless any of the following are present:[5] - Increased intracranial pressure - Focal neurologic abnormality - Suspected structural defect in the brain - Enlarged head - Severe head injury ## Treatment / Management No specific treatment for simple or complex febrile seizures is indicated other than supportive care and evaluation for possible underlying conditions causing the fever.
