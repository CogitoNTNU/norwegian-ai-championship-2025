Morbidly obese patients with weights exceeding this limit may not have angiography for technical safety concerns. **Relative Contraindications** Pregnancy, except in the presence of intractable hemorrhage with a risk of maternal death History of severe iodinated contrast medium allergy manifesting as bronchospasm, laryngospasm, angioedema, and cardiovascular collapse. Carbon dioxide angiography could be done on these patients when available. Patients with a history of mild allergic reactions can be pretreated with steroids and antihistamines. Patients with underlying renal impairment or dehydration are at high risk of developing renal function following exposure to contrast medium. Ultra-low contrast or zero contrast techniques have been proposed for this subset of patients.[6][7] Patients with coagulopathy, INR > 2, and platelet count < 50,000/microliter are at higher risk of bleeding. However, with the advent of vascular closure devices, the risk of bleeding is now minimal. Patients with diabetes on metformin are at risk of deterioration in renal function and lactic acidosis, especially if they have underlying renal impairment. Patients with excessive anxiety or who are unable to lie still may require conscious sedation. ## Equipment The procedure room for angiography and angiography related interventions should be spacious enough to accommodate all of the machinery as well as staff. - The essential equipment needed for conventional angiography include: - Set of catheters and guide wires - Autoinjector - Image intensifying screen - Sliding table - Remote computerized equipment - Biplane C-arm digital imaging - Generator ## Personnel Angiography teams are usually led by clinicians who possess highly specialized critical care and technical skills and maybe specialized in interventional radiology, vascular surgery, interventional neuroradiology, or interventional cardiology, depending on the specific study or procedure. Angiography lab nurses and nurse managers ensure the safety of patients before, during, and after the procedure, and they must possess critical care and cardiovascular monitoring skills. Radiology technicians in the angiography room possess the
