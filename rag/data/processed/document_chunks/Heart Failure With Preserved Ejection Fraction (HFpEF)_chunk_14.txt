sleep apnea, consultation with sleep medicine for possible polysomnography is recommended. Fatigue is a common symptom of heart failure, and daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of sleep apnea; obesity is a risk factor for both disease processes.[1] Using CardioMEMS, a pulmonary artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring system, improves quality of life and decreases hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF and frequent hospitalizations.[85] Additionally, CardioMEMS utilization has been shown to improve underlying metabolic comorbidities in tandem with improving pulmonary artery pressures.[85] Coronary angiogram and revascularization should be considered if ischemia is driving symptoms of HFpEF.[86] The 2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of heart failure receive palliative and supportive care.[1] In the context of patients with HFpEF, palliative care is defined as "patient- and family-centered care that optimizes health-related quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering."[1] Primary palliative care should begin early in the course of illness, and the interdisciplinary team can address many primary needs.[87] Components of primary palliative care include high-quality communication, anticipatory guidance, advance care planning, home and case management assistance, care coordination, and addressing barriers to care such as food insecurity and transportation needs.[1][87][88] **Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction** Multidisciplinary shock team assessment and intervention can improve 30-day all-cause mortality and reduce in-hospital mortality in patients with clinical and hemodynamics-proven cardiogenic shock of any etiology.[89] Intravenous vasopressor support can temporarily improve hemodynamics in patients with cardiogenic shock and improve end-organ perfusion; norepinephrine is preferred except in patients with tachyarrhythmias who benefit from phenylephrine. Vasopressor support allows time for diuresis and correction of precipitating factors like arrhythmia and ischemia. Appropriate ventilatory support and diuresis are the cornerstones of therapy for patients with acutely decompensated HFpEF. In most cases, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazide diuretics; there is no scientific evidence to support one loop diuretic over another in acutely decompensated patients with HFpEF. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial revealed no clinically significant differences in symptomatic improvement between bolus or continuous intravenous loop diuretics.[90] Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide, thiazide-like, or acetazolamide. Adding metolazone increases the risk of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality compared to loop diuretics alone.[91] Contrarily, the Acetazolamide in Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume OveRload (ADVOR) trial demonstrated that adding acetazolamide to loop diuretics increases the incidence of successful decongestion
