of CK-MB2 to CK-MB1 should be greater than 1.7 to 1. However, a ratio greater than or equal to 1.5 to 1 strongly indicates AMI. Additional cardiac conditions that increase serum CK and CK-MB in the serum are coronary artery bypass surgery, cardiac transplantation, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism.[45] Serum CK activity is significantly elevated in all types of muscular dystrophy.[46] In Duchenne sex-linked muscular dystrophy, enzyme activity is highest in childhood and may be elevated long before clinical signs appear, especially during infancy (7 to 10 years of age). Serum CK activity decreases as patients age, and the mass of functioning muscles diminishes with the progression of the disease. About 50% to 80% of the asymptomatic female carriers of Duchenne dystrophy show threefold to sixfold increases in CK activity.[47][48] High CK values are noted in viral myositis, polymyositis, and similar muscle diseases. However, serum enzyme activity is not increased in neurogenic muscle diseases like myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, poliomyelitis, and parkinsonism.[49] Patients with Alzheimer disease and Pick disease may have decreased CK activity in the brain. The BB-CK activity is primarily decreased in these patients, resulting in an overall decrease in total CK activity.[50] CK levels also rise in patients with rhabdomyolysis.[51] Rhabdomyolysis may result from a crush injury, drug use, viral infections, and strenuous exercise. The condition typically presents with muscle pain, weakness, and dark-colored urine. A breakdown of skeletal muscle is usually seen, releasing CK, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and electrolytes.[52] The reason for the dark urine is due to myoglobinuria. A CK level that increases to more than 1000 IU/L indicates rhabdomyolysis; values over 5000 IU/L indicate severe rhabdomyolysis. Patients with sickle cell trait who start a new strenuous exercise program such as spin class are also at an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, with reported CK levels higher than 70000 IU/L in some cases.[53] The most common complication resulting from rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney injury.[54] Any patient with suspected rhabdomyolysis should receive prompt treatment with IV fluids to preserve kidney function.[55] Patients on statins such as simvastatin may have an adverse effect of significantly elevated CK levels, potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis.[56] This risk increases if the patient takes a drug that inhibits cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4).[57] Some common medications to avoid in patients on statin therapy include clarithromycin, erythromycin, verapamil, tamoxifen, and antifungal agents.[56] Low levels of CK can be present in patients with connective tissue
