then emergency nursing staff in the early identification of sepsis, there was an increased staff knowledge of sepsis, decreased emergency department length of stay, and a statistically significant decrease in mortality.[43] Other similar studies showed a greater distribution of responsibility in the management of these complex patients from physicians to respiratory therapists and nursing staff, showing improved patient outcomes.[44] Like treatment, management, and rapid identification of sepsis all play a role in successful patient outcomes, the emphasis on education involving an interprofessional team has increased as well. Multiple curriculums and recommendations for addressing the development of these interprofessional teams have been put forth and typically focus on fluid resuscitation, empiric antibiotics, and vasopressor therapy.[45] Developing a successful strategy for managing and treating a complex disease process, such as sepsis, requires an interprofessional team approach.
