While most syncopal events are innocuous, cardiac syncope is often indicative of a potentially fatal, underlying disease process, carrying a one-year mortality rate of 30%. Distinguishing cardiac syncope from the myriad of other syncopal etiologies can be challenging. For this reason, it is imperative for all interprofessional team members to have a general knowledge of cardiac syncope and how to recognize it. This activity reviews a patient's workup with cardiac syncope and describes the interprofessional team's role in managing this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of cardiac syncope. - Describe the pathophysiology of cardiac syncope. - Summarize the treatment of cardiac syncope. - Outline the workup of a patient with cardiac syncope and describe the role of the interprofessional team to manage this condition.

Syncope is responsible for 740,000 trips to the emergency department and a quarter of a million hospital admissions each year in the United States alone.[1] Causes of syncope range widely, including vasovagal, neurologic, metabolic, pulmonary, volume depletion, and cardiac. While most syncopal events are innocuous, cardiac syncope is often indicative of a potentially fatal, underlying disease process, carrying a one-year mortality rate of 30%.[2] Cardiac syncope occurs when the source of one's loss of consciousness stems from a problem in the heart that prevents it from supplying enough nutrients and oxygen to the brain. This cardiac problem may be a rhythm disturbance, a structural problem, or a structural problem that predisposes a patient to a rhythm disturbance. Cardiac syncope is estimated to be
