or myocardial infarction. If the dissection propagates into peripheral vessels, symptoms like loss of pulses, pain, and paresthesias in the extremities may occur. Physical findings are diverse and may provide critical diagnostic clues. Still, classical signs like blood pressure discrepancies between the upper extremities, pulse deficits, or a diastolic murmur are found in less than 50% of confirmed acute aortic dissection cases. These signs should raise clinical suspicion, especially if combined with typical pain and neurological symptoms. Blood pressure discrepancies greater than 20 mm Hg between arms, a pulse deficit, or wide pulse pressure are red flags in the physical exam. Hypertension is common in acute aortic dissection, but hypotension is a grave sign, often indicating aortic rupture or cardiac tamponade. Patients may present with muffled heart sounds, syncope, and shock in such cases. A new diastolic murmur suggests aortic insufficiency, often associated with proximal dissections. If the dissection involves the carotid or subclavian arteries, signs of Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) or hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement may appear. Additionally, dyspnea and hemoptysis may result from dissection rupture into the mediastinum. Notably, if a patient presents with abdominal pain, renal or biliary colic, or bowel obstruction/perforation, nondissection-related mesenteric ischemia should be considered. Pulse deficit can be a sign of nondissection-related embolic phenomena or arterial occlusion.[19] In summary, the clinical presentation of acute aortic dissection varies widely. While the classic signs and symptoms are invaluable for diagnosis, the absence of these features does not rule out the condition. A combination of a detailed pain history, neurological findings, and physical examination features such as blood pressure discrepancies, pulse deficits, or murmurs should alert clinicians to the possibility of a dissection and prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation. ## Evaluation The evaluation and workup of acute aortic dissection are centered on rapid identification and confirmation of the condition, given its high mortality if left untreated. The diagnostic approach is guided by clinical suspicion, the patientâ€™s hemodynamic stability, and the availability of imaging modalities. An integrated approach combining clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and advanced imaging modalities is essential to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management. **Clinical Evaluation** As previously discussed, the initial assessment begins with a focused history and physical examination. Once a patient with a possible aortic dissection is identified, further workup begins. **Electrocardiogram** Although an electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely performed to evaluate chest pain, its findings are often
