the initial diagnostic step. **Diagnostic Algorithm** - MRCP and CT are the preferred imaging modalities. - Detect calcifications (hallmark sign), pancreatic enlargement, and ductal obstruction or dilation. - MRCP is more sensitive and specific for chronic pancreatitis than transabdominal ultrasound or plain x-rays, though both can reveal calcifications. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an alternative, particularly for early chronic pancreatitis before fibrosis develops. - More invasive and less specific than MRCP or CT. - Reserved for cases where MRCP or CT is nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion remains high.[23][25][26] - Secretin-enhanced MRCP may be used if standard imaging and EUS are inconclusive. - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was the previous gold standard but is now largely supplanted by MRCP. - This technique is still used if therapeutic intervention, such as biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy, stent placement, or stone extraction, is needed. - Pancreatic biopsy is indicated if clinical suspicion is high, but imaging remains nondiagnostic. - Direct and indirect exocrine function tests can be performed at any point in the diagnostic process but should complement imaging studies rather than replace them.[24] - Direct pancreatic function tests: - The cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation test measures trypsin or lipase and is sensitive to early exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. However, it is limited in availability and uncomfortable for patients. - Endoscopic secretin stimulation test measures bicarbonate secretion but requires upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, making it costly and invasive. - Indirect pancreatic function tests: - The 13C-mixed triglyceride test is 90% sensitive but takes up to 6 hours to perform and is not widely available. - The fecal elastase test is widely available and practical. - Serum testing: - Trypsin or trypsinogen levels are no longer recommended, as they lack specificity and correlation with imaging findings. ## Treatment / Management The primary goals of treatment are managing pain and improving malabsorption. Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis arises from inflammation, neuropathic mechanisms, and ductal obstruction. Once established, chronic pain is typically persistent and lifelong without intervention and can be debilitating.[27] One of the most critical steps in management is encouraging alcohol cessation, as continued alcohol use can exacerbate pain and accelerate disease progression. Similarly, smoking cessation is vital and essential, as smoking is known to worsen the condition over time. Intervention is not clearly indicated when ductal strictures or stones are present, but the patient remains asymptomatic. However, if these obstructions cause symptoms, therapeutic options such as endoscopic procedures,
