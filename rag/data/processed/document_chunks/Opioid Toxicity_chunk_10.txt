may be reversed with changes in body position or fluid administration. Other coingestants must be considered if the hypotension is severe and unresponsive to fluids. **Gastrointestinal evaluation** Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with opiate toxicity. These symptoms occur because opiates can induce gastric aperistalsis and slow down intestinal motility. **Psychiatric features** Opiates are generalized CNS depressants. However, these drugs can also cause anxiety, agitation, depression, dysphoria, hallucinations, nightmares, and paranoia. **Neurological assessment** Opiates can lower the seizure threshold, potentially leading to generalized seizures, particularly in young children. This effect is mainly due to the paradoxical excitation of the brain. The opiates most commonly involved in adults experiencing seizures are propoxyphene and meperidine. Hearing loss may occur in rare cases, particularly in individuals who have consumed alcohol with heroin. However, this auditory deficit is usually reversible. ## Evaluation Opiate overdose or toxicity must always be considered in patients presenting with lethargy of an unknown cause. Many individuals who abuse opiates may concurrently use other illicit substances, such as cocaine, or prescription drugs, like antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Suspicion of coingestants should be raised when the usual clinical signs and symptoms of opiate toxicity are absent and the patient does not respond to the opiate antagonist naloxone.[24][25][26][27] **Laboratory Studies** Laboratory studies are often conducted for patients with drug overdoses. Drug screens are widely available but may not significantly affect initial management due to the high potential for false positives and negatives. In patients with opiate toxicity or overdose, the following blood work is usually performed: - Complete blood cell count - Comprehensive metabolic panel - Creatine kinase level - Arterial blood gas determinations - Pregnancy testing - Acetaminophen and salicylate testing **Imaging Studies** A chest x-ray should be obtained if lung injury is suspected. An abdominal x-ray or computed tomography should be obtained if the patient is possibly a body packer. **Electrocardiography** Electrocardiography (ECG) is recommended in all patients with suspected opioid overdose. Coingestants like tricyclics have the potential to cause arrhythmias. ## Treatment / Management **Prehospital Management** Often, the first responder at the scene of a suspected opioid overdose is a nonmedical individual, such as a police officer. As of 2016, over 1,214 law enforcement agencies have trained their officers to administer naloxone in the field. This community involvement has led to increased survival rates following overdose incidents in the Midwest United States.[28] Emergency medical technicians must be aware of
