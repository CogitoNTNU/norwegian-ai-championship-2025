with active pleural inflammation called pleurisy complain of sharp, severe, localized crescendo-decrescendo pain with breathing or coughing. Pleuritic pain tends to subside when an effusion develops. Constant pain is also a hallmark of malignant diseases such as mesothelioma. The physical examination findings can range from subtle to florid. Intercostal space fullness and percussion dullness are appreciated in large effusions. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and tactile and vocal fremiti. Egophony is most pronounced in the superior aspect of effusion. Pleural rubs, often mistaken for coarse crackles, can be heard during active pleurisy without any effusion. As pleural effusion results from varied diseases, history should focus on the causes of miscellaneous pulmonary and systemic effusions. Inquiring about a patient's comorbidities, medications, clinical indicators for infectious diseases, and predisposing factors to malignancies is advisable. A comprehensive physical examination should also encompass various potential diagnostic considerations. For example, congestive heart failure should be suspected in a patient with jugular venous distension, S3 heart sound, and pedal edema. Advanced liver cirrhosis should be considered in individuals with ascites and caput medusae. ## Evaluation A chest radiograph is an excellent initial imaging study for identifying pleural effusion. In an upright posteroanterior view, the meniscus sign indicates the presence of a significant amount of pleural fluid, typically exceeding 200 mL and blunting the costophrenic angle (see **Image.** Right Lung Pleural Effusion Radiograph, Posteroanterior). In lesser quantities of pleural effusion, blunting of the costophrenic angles on posteroanterior erect chest roentgenograms serves as a clue to elicit further investigations. However, a lateral decubitus view can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid in the pleural space (see **Image.** Pleural Effusion Radiograph, Lateral Decubitus).[[15]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13089-023-00356-z) Ultrasound is more sensitive and is readily available for diagnosing and confirming an effusion and planning a thoracentesis.[[7]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=165654#ref_30272503)[[8]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=165654#ref_29916720)[14] All initial effusion occurrences warrant a thoracentesis to ascertain the underlying etiology of the condition, except in instances where heart failure is confidently suspected. In such cases, a trial of diuresis may be conducted as a preliminary measure. Incorporating thoracic ultrasound in management planning is crucial. This test's prompt availability and rapid performance reduce the need for ancillary diagnostic testing such as computed tomography (CT) and offer valuable insights into fluid characteristics, which can aid in diagnosis (see **Image.** Bilateral Pleural Effusions on Chest Computed Tomography).[15] In addition, thoracic ultrasound assists in differentiating fluid accumulation from other conditions that present as radiopaque abnormalities on chest radiographs,
