This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing cardiac ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure. **Objectives:** - Identify the indications for the cardiac ultrasound. - Evaluate the technique involved in cardiac ultrasound. - Assess the equipment used for the cardiac ultrasound. - Communicate interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to advance the use of cardiac ultrasound and improve patient outcomes.

It was first adopted by cardiologists for diagnostic purposes in the 1960s and later by emergency physicians as one of several point-of-care ultrasound applications from head to toe. As a result of these two temporally and specialist-independent adaptations, 2 different conventions are used to perform a cardiac ultrasound exam, which will be discussed further. ## Anatomy and Physiology The heart sits obliquely behind and slightly to the left of the sternum, with the atria more superiorly positioned in the direction of the right shoulder, and the ventricles lie anterior and inferior, ending approximately at the left nipple. The right ventricle is the heart's most anterior chamber, typically at the fourth intercostal space. The right atrium sends blood to the right ventricle in a right-to-left and superior-to-inferior direction via the tricuspid valve. The left atrium simultaneously sends blood to the left ventricle in parallel via the mitral valve. The ascending aorta takes off anteriorly from the left ventricle, heading behind the sternum to the right before it courses superiorly and to the patientâ€™s left. ## Indications Following are some important indications of doing a cardiac ultrasound: 1\. Chest pain - Left ventricle wall motion abnormalities, or failure of certain parts of the left ventricle wall to
