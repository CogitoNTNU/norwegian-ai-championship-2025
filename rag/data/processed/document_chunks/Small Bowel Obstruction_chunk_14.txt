depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, the patient's overall health status, the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment, and whether the obstruction is simple or complicated (eg, involving strangulation or perforation). Early diagnosis and prompt management significantly improve outcomes, while delays in treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. **Simple SBO** Patients with simple SBO, where there is no evidence of ischemia or perforation, generally have a favorable prognosis. Nonoperative management resolves most cases of partial or adhesional obstructions without surgery. Recovery is typically rapid if managed appropriately, with mortality rates in these cases being low (1%â€“5%). However, recurrent SBO remains a challenge, particularly in patients with prior surgeries and adhesions. **Complicated SBO** Complicated SBO, involving bowel strangulation, ischemia, or perforation, carries a significantly worse prognosis due to the risk of sepsis, peritonitis, and multiorgan failure. Mortality rates in these cases range from 10% to 40%, depending on the extent of bowel compromise and the speed of surgical intervention. Strangulated obstructions, which may progress to gangrene or perforation, demand urgent surgical treatment to minimize life-threatening complications. **Prognostic Factors** Several factors influence prognosis: - Etiology - Adhesional SBO generally has a better prognosis than obstruction caused by malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease. Malignant bowel obstruction often indicates advanced disease, with limited curative options and a focus on palliative care. - Age and comorbidities - Elderly patients and those with significant comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have higher risks of complications and mortality. - Timeliness of treatment - Delays in diagnosis or intervention can worsen outcomes due to prolonged ischemia, necrosis, or systemic infection. - Extent of bowel damage - The need for extensive bowel resection may lead to short bowel syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, and long-term morbidity. **Long-Term Outcomes** SBOs, particularly those caused by adhesions, can recur in about 20% of patients.[37] Preventive strategies, including minimally invasive surgery and adhesion barriers, can help reduce recurrence. Functional recovery after SBO varies; most patients resume normal bowel function, while some may experience prolonged ileus or other complications requiring further intervention. **Survival Rates** Long-term survival is excellent for simple SBO, especially when the obstruction is resolved nonoperatively or via uncomplicated surgery. In cases of malignant obstruction, survival is dictated by the stage and progression of the underlying malignancy, often requiring a palliative approach. ## Complications SBO can lead to a range of complications, many of which are life-threatening if
