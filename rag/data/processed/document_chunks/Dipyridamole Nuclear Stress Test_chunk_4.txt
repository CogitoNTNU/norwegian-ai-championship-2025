**Dermatologic System Effects** - Hypersensitivity reaction, injection site reaction, pruritis, skin rash, and urticaria **Gastrointestinal System Effects** - Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea, eructation, flatulence, tenesmus, and vomiting **Psychiatric System Effects** - Depersonalization **Lymphatic System Effects** - Edema **Musculoskeletal System Effects** - Arthralgia, back pain, claudication, generalized weakness, myalgia, and rigidity ## Contraindications The main contraindications for the application of dipyridamole are previous hypersensitivity reactions and thrombocytopenia. **Disease-related Concerns** - Cardiovascular disease: Use requires caution in patients with hypotension, unstable angina, and/or recent MI; may enhance exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. - Hepatic impairment: Use requires caution in patients with hepatic impairment. **Concurrent Drug Therapy Issues** - Antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants: Use requires caution in patients on other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation. **Dosage Form Specific Issues** - Injection: Severe adverse reactions have infrequently occurred with IV administration. Use the IV dosage form with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease or unstable angina. Testers should have aminophylline ready in case of urgency or emergency with IV use. ## Monitoring Current guidelines do not suggest routine laboratory testing for therapeutic monitoring of dipyridamole. There are no required scheduled laboratory evaluations for associated toxicities. The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology does suggest monitoring the patients for toxicity while undergoing perfusion testing with particular attention for signs of hypoperfusion, including extremity cyanosis, pallor, or decreased temperature.[17] In addition to the physical manifestations, vigilance for the changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or respiration should occur while using dipyridamole for pharmacologic stress testing.[16][18] **Pharmacokinetic Parameters** - Half-life elimination: 10 to 12 hours - Peak time: 2 to 2.5 hours - Onset: 24 minutes - Duration: 3 hours - Protein-bound: 91 to 99% - Vd: 2 to 3 L/kg - Clearance: 2.3 to 3.5 mL/min/kg - Excretion: Fecal excretion - Metabolism: Liver - Dialyzable: not-dialyzable ## Toxicity To reverse any complications and side effects of dipyridamole, aminophylline (50 to 250 mg IV push over 30 to 60 seconds given no sooner than 1 minute after the radiotracer injection) should be on hand for urgent/emergent use.[18] This use is particularly used in the setting of adverse effects while undergoing pharmacologic stress testing. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes When using dipyridamole in the setting of pharmacologic stress testing, it is essential to actively look out for the clinical findings associated with an adverse pharmacologic stress test. As outlined above, monitoring for hypoperfusion while undergoing diagnostic testing
