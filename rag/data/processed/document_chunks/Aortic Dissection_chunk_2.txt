the diaphragm (type 3a) or below the diaphragm (type 3b) Ascending dissections (Stanford type A or DeBakey types 1 and 2) are nearly twice as common as descending dissections (Stanford type B or DeBakey type 3), necessitating an urgent, specialized approach to reduce the risk of fatal complications such as aortic rupture, stroke, or myocardial infarction (see **Image.** Aortic Dissection, Type A).[6] ## Etiology Predisposing high-risk factors for nontraumatic aortic dissection include: - Hypertension (occurs in 70% of patients with distal Stanford type B dissections) - An abrupt, transient, severe increase in blood pressure (eg, strenuous weight lifting and use of sympathomimetic agents such as cocaine, ecstasy, or energy drinks) - Genetic conditions include: - Marfan syndrome - In an International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) review, Marfan syndrome was present in 50% of those younger than 40, compared with only 2% of older patients. - In patients with Marfan syndrome, cystic medial necrosis is seen in the tissues. - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - Turner syndrome - Bicuspid aortic valve - Coarctation of the aorta - Preexisting aortic aneurysm - Atherosclerosis - Pregnancy and delivery - This risk is compounded in pregnant women with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. - Family history - Aortic instrumentation or surgery (eg, coronary artery bypass, aortic or mitral valve replacement, and percutaneous stenting or catheter insertion) - Inflammatory or infectious diseases that cause vasculitis (eg, syphilis, cocaine use) [7] ## Epidemiology Acute aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening condition, with an incidence of 5 to 30 cases per 1 million people per year. This contrasts sharply with acute myocardial infarction, which has approximately 4400 cases per 1 million people annually. Aortic dissection accounts for 3 out of every 1000 emergency department presentations involving acute chest, back, or abdominal pain. The condition predominantly affects individuals between 40 and 70, with most cases occurring in patients aged 50 to 65. Approximately 75% of dissections happen in this age range, highlighting age as a key risk factor. While men are 3 times more likely to develop aortic dissection than women, women often present later in the disease course and have worse outcomes.[8] The risk profile differs between older and younger patients: older patients are more likely to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, prior aortic aneurysm, or iatrogenic dissection, while younger patients, particularly those younger than 40, are more likely to have connective tissue disorders like Marfan
