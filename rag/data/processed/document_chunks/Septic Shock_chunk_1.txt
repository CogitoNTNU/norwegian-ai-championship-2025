immune system are activated in concert with the activation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils that interact with the endothelium through pathogen recognition receptors to elaborate cytokines, proteases, kinins, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide.[1] As the primary site of this response, the endothelium not only suffers microvascular injury but also activates the coagulation and complement cascades, which further exacerbate vascular injury, leading to capillary leak. This cascade of events is responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis and progression from sepsis to septic shock. The ability to balance pro-inflammatory responses to eradicate the invading microorganism with anti-inflammatory signals set to control the overall inflammatory cascade ultimately determines the degree of morbidity and/or mortality experienced by the patient. Judicious and early antimicrobial administration, sepsis care bundle use, and early goal-directed therapies have significantly and positively impacted sepsis-related mortality. However, early identification remains the best therapeutic tool for sepsis treatment and management. ## Etiology The 2009 European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II study) determined that gram-negative bacterial infections far exceed other etiologies as the most common cause of sepsis syndromes, with a frequency of 62%, followed by gram-positive infections at 47%. An increase in the prevalence of the latter may be attributable to the performance of more invasive procedures and increased incidence of nosocomial infections.[2] Predominant micro-organisms isolated in patients include _Staphylococcus aureus_ (20%), _Pseudomonas_ (20%), and _Escherichia coli_ (16%).[3] Predominant sites of infection include respiratory (42%), bloodstream (21%), and genitourinary (10%).[2] These data need to be assessed in the context of knowing that over a third of patients never grow positive cultures.[4] The influence of bacterial strain and site of infection on mortality was illustrated in a large meta-analysis.[5] In this study, gram-negative infections were overall associated with higher mortality. However, gram-positive bacteremia with _Acinetobacter_ or pneumonia with _Staphylococcus_ carried a 40% mortality with _Pseudomonal_ pneumonia carrying the highest mortality at 70%. Sepsis syndromes caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)) are on the rise with a current incidence of up to 25%; viruses and parasites cause far fewer cases and are identified in 2% to 4% of cases.[6] Risk factors that predispose to sepsis include: - Diabetes - Malignancy - Chronic kidney and liver disease - Use of corticosteroids - Immunosuppressed state - Burns - Major surgery - Trauma - Presence of indwelling catheters - Prolonged hospitalization - Hemodialysis - Extremes
