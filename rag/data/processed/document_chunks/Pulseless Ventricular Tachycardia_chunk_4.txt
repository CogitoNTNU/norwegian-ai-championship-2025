2 breaths.[11][7] Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed only until the defibrillator is ready. Defibrillation requires fewer joules if it is done early. After every shock, chest compressions should be performed, along with oxygen delivery and intravenous injection of vasopressors and antiarrhythmic drugs.[7][12] After the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient should be monitored continuously. Metabolic acidosis quickly follows cardiovascular collapse. If the arrhythmia is terminated within 30 to 60 seconds, significant acidosis does not occur. If a patient is unresponsive after return to a normal rhythm or the event happened out-of-hospital, hypothermia cooling to 32-34 degrees Celcius for 24 hours should be initiated for possible neurologic recovery.[7] In every case of pulseless VT acute myocardial infarction should be suspected and urgent coronary angiography and PCI should be considered if feasible.[10][13] Fibrinolytic therapy during CPR for pulseless VT is not recommended. Medical treatment of pulseless VT usually is carried out along with defibrillation and includes intravenous vasopressors and antiarrhythmic drugs. 1 mg of epinephrine IV should be given every 3 to 5 minutes. Epinephrine can be replaced by vasopressin given 40 units IV once.[14] Amiodarone is the most studied drug and is used for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Sotalol is the most widely used alternative but is associated with an increased risk of SCD due to decreasing defibrillation threshold. Patients on beta-blockers reported having lower mortality rates. For primary prevention of SCD in patients from the high-risk group, as well as for secondary prevention in patients who already have a prior history of sustained VT or VF, ICD implantation is recommended.[15][16] Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) have benefits in terms of mortality and survival rates compared to medical treatment. ## Differential Diagnosis The following signs speak in favor of ventricular tachycardia: QRS complex greater than 0.14 seconds with right bundle branch morphology or greater than 0.16 seconds with left bundle branch morphology, RS interval > 100 ms in a precordial lead, AV dissociation, negative QRS concordance in the precordial leads and ventricular fusion beats.[12] If the patientâ€™s condition allows, differential diagnosis of a wide-complex tachycardia should be made between ventricular tachycardia (80% of wide-QRS tachycardia cases), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction (15% to 20%) and SVT with pre-excitation and antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) (1% to 5%).[16] Every wide complex tachycardia should be considered as VT until proven otherwise.[17][18] ## Prognosis Prognosis of pulseless ventricular tachycardia heavily depends on
