in the afternoon and winter months.[16] Some children have a single febrile seizure event, while 30% of children have multiple seizures during early childhood. ## Pathophysiology The exact pathophysiology of febrile seizures is not understood fully, but there is a recognized complex genetic predisposition, immaturity and vulnerability of the central nervous system, and various environmental factors. As a result of these various risk factors, the immature brain, with fever-enhanced neuronal excitation, is more susceptible to seizures and is one explanation as to why they occur more commonly in those younger than 3.[17] ## History and Physical **Clinical History** A comprehensive medical history and detailed description of the seizure event are essential for the evaluation of a possible febrile seizure. Because febrile seizures most commonly occur in children, a parent or caregiver is critical to help provide the patient's history, including vaccination history, immunization status, family history of seizure activity, any recent illness, development, exposure to toxins, and personal medical history. Historical information regarding the interval between fever onset and seizure activity, seizure appearance, length, and postictal symptoms should also be obtained, as this can help differentiate simple febrile seizures from complex types.[5][4] Simple febrile seizures usually have a single episode of generalized tonic-clonic movements, often involving facial and respiratory muscles, lasting less than 15 minutes with a short period of postictal drowsiness. Conversely, complex febrile seizures are characterized by focal seizures, usually limited to one side of the body, lasting 15 minutes or more, that can recur within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizures are frequently followed by postictal weakness or paralysis on one side of the body (ie, Todd paralysis). Other associated symptoms for both febrile seizure types include loss of consciousness, foaming at the mouth, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. Additionally, clinicians should inquire about possible central nervous system (CNS) infection and underlying structural abnormalities to determine whether an event of concern constitutes a febrile seizure or a more severe illness presenting with a seizure.[5][4] **Clinical Examination** Following seizure activity, patients must undergo a general physical and a neurologic exam to ensure that the patient has had a neurologic return to their baseline state. However, differential diagnoses should be considered if a patient continues to have acute neurologic impairment or symptoms (eg, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, or weakness) on an exam. During the physical exam, serial vital signs should be obtained, and findings that may suggest the underlying etiology of
