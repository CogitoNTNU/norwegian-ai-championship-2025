β-chain. The process involves enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C to release the N-terminal hexapeptide, followed by separation and quantification of glycated and non-glycated hexapeptides.[11] HbA1c is expressed as the ratio of glycated to total hexapeptides. A network of IFCC-designated reference laboratories maintains and supports this standardized framework, ensuring its reliability for assay calibration.[12] Comparative analyses of the IFCC system with the NGSP and other regional standards demonstrate robust correlation, enabling manufacturers to align their assays with the IFCC reference method.[13] However, HbA1c values derived from IFCC methods are typically 1.5% to 2% lower than NGSP values due to differences in the glycated fractions measured. The IFCC method is not intended for routine clinical use but is a calibration standard for commercial assays. For clinical testing, NGSP-certified methods are recommended.[14] In laboratory settings, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using cation-exchange chromatography remains a cornerstone technique for HbA1c measurement. This method effectively removes labile intermediates that may interfere with alternative approaches, such as immunoassays or affinity chromatography. Fully automated HPLC systems are widely available, requiring minimal sample volumes (approximately 5 μL of whole blood). Although venous blood is standard, capillary blood from a finger prick is also acceptable. Samples are diluted with a borate-containing hemolysis reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes to eliminate labile Schiff bases before analysis.[15][16] Immunoassay-based methods are also prevalent, using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the Amadori product (ketoamine linkage) and distinct amino acid sequences at the N-terminal of the hemoglobin β-chain. A widely used format, latex agglutination inhibition, involves a synthetic polymer bearing HbA1c epitopes that competes with patient HbA1c for binding to antibody-coated latex beads. This competition reduces agglutination, which is quantifiable as decreased absorbance. Enzyme immunoassays using analogous antibodies exhibit acceptable precision and are typically calibrated to HPLC-derived values. These assays are highly specific, excluding labile intermediates; other glycated hemoglobin, such as HbA1a and HbA1b; and common hemoglobin variants, such as HbF, HbA2, HbS, and carbamylated hemoglobin.[17][18] Recent advancements have introduced enzymatic assays using fructosyl peptide oxidase for HbA1c quantification, alongside automated liquid-flow capillary electrophoresis systems, which provide viable alternatives for routine clinical testing.[19] POC devices are increasingly used for HbA1c measurement in clinical settings. However, the diversity of available POC systems complicates selection, as comparative performance data are limited. Notably, POC measurements typically yield values approximately 0.5% lower than laboratory-based assays and may exhibit reduced accuracy compared to venous blood samples
