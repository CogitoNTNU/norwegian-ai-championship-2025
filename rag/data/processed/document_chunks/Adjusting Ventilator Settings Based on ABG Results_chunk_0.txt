This test provides vital information about acid-base balance, oxygenation, and ventilation status, guiding ventilator setting adjustments.[1] For instance, a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood may require increasing the respiratory rate or tidal volume to enhance carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, while a low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) may necessitate increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygenation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on ABG results are vital for preventing complications and improving outcomes.[2] This activity provides a guide on adjusting ventilator parameters based on ABG results, emphasizing individualized care and evidence-based practices. **Basic Ventilator Parameters** Ventilator parameters are critical in cases requiring mechanical ventilation. Understanding and properly adjusting these parameters are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. The key adjustable ventilator parameters include the tidal volume (Vt), frequency (F), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), PEEP, inspiratory time (Ti), inspiratory flow (V’), and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E). **Tidal volume** Vt is the amount of air delivered to the lungs with each ventilator breath. Vt is typically set based on the patient’s predicted body weight. Proper Vt setting is crucial to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. Lower Vts are generally preferred to reduce the risk of overdistension and subsequent lung damage, particularly in conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome.[3] **Frequency** F or respiratory rate is the number of breaths the ventilator delivers per minute. Adjusting the respiratory rate helps manage the patient’s CO2 levels. A higher respiratory rate can help reduce PaCO2 in those who RE hypercapnic, but it must be balanced to avoid intrinsic PEEP and ensure adequate expiratory time.[4] **Fraction of inspired oxygen** FiO2 is the concentration of oxygen delivered to the patient. FiO2 is expressed as a fraction of 1.0 (eg, 0.21 for room air and 1.0 for 100% oxygen). FiO2 is adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation. Prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels can cause oxygen toxicity, so the goal is to use the lowest FiO2 that achieves satisfactory oxygenation.[5] **Positive
