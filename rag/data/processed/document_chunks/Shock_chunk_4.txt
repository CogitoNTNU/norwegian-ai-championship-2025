with shockable rhythm to prevent brain injury and improve survival. **Procedures** - Central line placement plays a role in fluid resuscitation, access for multiple infusions, and allows invasive monitoring of central venous pressure. - Arterial line placement is useful in providing continuous blood pressure monitoring, especially in patients requiring inotropic agents. - Mechanical ventilation is indicated in patients with cardiogenic shock for oxygenation and airway protection. **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Coronary Artery Bypass** - Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be performed, irrespective of time delay from the onset of myocardial infarction - Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting is indicated in patients with coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI. SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial data confirmed an approach that combines early revascularization with medical management in patients with cardiogenic shock is optimal. **Mechanical Circulatory Support** Due to the poor prognosis associated with cardiogenic shock, medical therapy is often inadequate, and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy to improve end-organ perfusion may be required. An experienced interprofessional team should evaluate MCS. - Percutaneous circulatory assist devices provide superior hemodynamic support compared with pharmacologic therapy. - Intra-aortic balloon pumps can be considered but are less likely to provide a benefit compared to other MCS devices and should not be routinely used but may still play an important role in patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defects, or when other MCS devices cannot be placed. - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is indicated in patients with poor oxygenation not expected to improve with alternative temporary mechanical support devices rapidly. - In properly selected patients not likely to recover from cardiogenic shock without long-term MCS support, a ventricular assist device can be implanted as a bridge to recovery, bridge to bridge, bridge to transplant, or destination therapy. - Cardiac transplantation may be performed in suitable candidates not expected to recover after MCS device implantation may be the only hope for meaningful long-term recovery. However, it remains a very limited option owing to the low number of available hearts. Short-term mechanical circulatory assist - IABP (Intra-aortic balloon pump) - Non-IABP percutaneous mechanical devices - ECMO **IABP- Intra-aortic balloon pump** - Most commonly used and least expensive of all mechanical support devices. - Easy and rapid insertion. - It is the device with which interventional cardiologists are most familiar. Some of the other indications apart from cardiogenic shock include intractable
