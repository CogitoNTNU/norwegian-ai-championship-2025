is targeted, causing inflammation and secondary edema, microhemorrhage, and cellular immune reaction. - The cellular reaction consists of mononuclear lymphocytes and progresses to PMNs recruitment. - Fibrin is released. - Both CD4 and CD8 cells are involved, beginning a cascade of immune product secretion that can end in increased vascular permeability and resultant edema. - This process may lead to intra-alveolar organization and an obliterans clinical picture. - The far end of the spectrum of the process includes interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. ## History and Physical There are no pathognomonic history cues for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia as opposed to bacterial pneumonia. However, cues are suggestive in the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia: - Gradual onset as opposed to the sudden onset of symptoms. - Lower temperature - Lack of purulent sputum - History of immunosuppression - Prodromal viral upper respiratory tract illness - History of HIV - History of solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic transplantation - History of neoplasm - Concomitant flu symptoms - Concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms There are no pathognomonic physical examination findings for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia as opposed to bacterial pneumonia. However, physical findings are suggestive in the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia: - Tachycardia or tachypnea out of proportion to the temperature - Temperature elevation disproportionately low to the level of debility - Concomitant upper respiratory tract infection - Rash - The paucity of physical findings on pulmonary exam disproportionate to the level of debility - Bilateral positive lung findings ## Evaluation As noted above, both history and physical examination may provide few diagnostic cues as to the etiology of pneumonia (bacterial versus virus). With the existence of specific effective treatment modalities, diagnoses of and identification of viruses causing pneumonia is of increased importance. Fortunately, the diagnostic acuity of laboratory examination in combination with radiography and history and physical examination has progressed.[10][11][12] **Laboratory Examination** **_CBC with differential_** - There are no absolute diagnostic findings as viral pneumonia may result in elevated, normal, or decreased WBC counts. However, viral etiology is less commonly associated with elevated WBC and "left shifts" of the differential than bacterial types of pneumonia. **_Chemistry panel_** - Useful for gauging the degree of dehydration, relative renal dysfunction, and dosing of renal excreted medications **_C-reactive protein_** - As a reactive phase reactant, the CRP level may be elevated with viral pneumonia, although this is not a specific or
