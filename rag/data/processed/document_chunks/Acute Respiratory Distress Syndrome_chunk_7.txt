high PEEP - Prolonged mechanical ventilation (necessitating tracheostomy) - Post-extubation laryngeal edema and subglottic stenosis - Nosocomial infections - Pneumonia - Line sepsis - Urinary tract infection - Deep venous thrombosis - Antibiotic resistance - Muscle weakness - Renal failure - Post-traumatic stress disorder ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care **Tracheostomy and**Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy\*\*\*\* Many patients with ARDS require a tracheostomy and a percutaneous feeding tube (PEG) in the recovery phase. The tracheostomy facilitates weaning from the ventilator, making it easy to clear the secretions and more comfortable. The tracheostomy is usually performed at 2 to 3 weeks, followed by a PEG. **Nutritional Support** Most patients with ARDS have difficulty eating, and muscle wasting is very common. These patients are either given enteral or parenteral feeding, depending on the condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Some experts recommend a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet as it has anti-inflammatory and vasodilating effects. Almost every type of nutritional supplement has been studied in patients with ARDS, but none has proven to be the magic bullet. **Activity** Since patients with ARDS are bed-bound, frequent position changes are highly recommended to prevent bedsores and deep venous thrombosis. One can minimize the sedation in alert patients and sit them in a chair. ## Consultations Care of patients with ARDS requires an interprofessional team of healthcare workers that includes the following: - Pulmonologist - Respiratory therapist - Intensivist - Infectious disease specialist - Dietitian ## Deterrence and Patient Education Even though many risk factors for ARDS are known, there is no way to prevent ARDS proactively. However, careful management of fluids in high-risk patients can be helpful. Steps should be taken to avoid aspiration by keeping the head of the bed elevated before feeding. Employing a lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy in patients at high risk for ARDS could aid in preventing the onset of this condition. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes ARDS is a severe disorder of the lungs with the potential to cause death. Patients with ARDS may require mechanical ventilation because of hypoxia.[24] The management is usually in the ICU with an interprofessional healthcare team. ARDS has effects beyond the lung. Prolonged mechanical ventilation often leads to bedsores, deep venous thrombosis, multisystem organ failure, weight loss, and poor overall functioning. It is essential to have an integrated approach to ARDS management because it usually affects many organs in the body. These patients need nutritional support, chest physiotherapy, treatment
