testing and imaging depend on the history and physical examination. Suggested diagnostic testing includes the following: - CBC for patients with bleeding or signs of infection - Type and cross-match for individuals with significant hemorrhage - Urinalysis and possibly urine culture for suspected urinary tract infection or acute complicated urinary tract infection - Blood cultures for suspected disseminated infection - Testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis in patients with risk factors or symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease - Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound to assess for free fluid indicating a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, or trauma and locating a pregnancy in patients with a positive pregnancy test - CT of the abdomen and pelvis in nonpregnant adults with suspected appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, or nephrolithiasis or when the ultrasound findings are unrevealing - Colonoscopy for patients with anemia and abdominal pain to evaluate for colon cancer or subacute abdominal pain and diarrhea to assess for inflammatory bowel disease - Scrotal ultrasound for abnormal scrotal examination **Diffuse Abdominal Pain** Diffuse abdominal pain can be more challenging to diagnose and result from pulmonary, cardiac, or intraabdominal pathologies. The initial evaluation for diffuse abdominal pain includes: - CBC with differential - Serum electrolytes - Amylase and lipase - Calculation of the anion gap - Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine - Serum glucose - Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin - Calcium - Pregnancy test in all patients with childbearing potential The remaining evaluation depends on the results of the initial assessment. Some additional considerations are as follows: - Chest radiograph for patients with diffuse upper abdominal pain and suspected pneumonia - Abdominal radiographs to evaluate for pneumoperitoneum and bowel obstruction - CT pulmonary angiogram for patients with diffuse upper abdominal pain and suspected pulmonary embolism - CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis for patients with a suspected volvulus, bowel obstruction, and hemodynamically stable patients with a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm - Abdominal ultrasound for patients with a suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who are hemodynamically unstable - IV-enhanced CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for patients with concern for mesenteric ischemia and aortic dissection The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines that help healthcare professionals determine the best imaging or treatment for a patient.
