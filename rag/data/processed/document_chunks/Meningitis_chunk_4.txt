enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, and arbovirus.[2][4][7] Typical CSF findings in patients with aseptic meningitis include an opening pressure that is either normal (\<180 mmH2O) or slightly elevated. Glucose levels are usually normal to mildly decreased, while protein levels are normal to mildly elevated (\<200 mg/dL). The cell count ranges from 10 to 1000 cells per microliter, with an initial predominance of neutrophils (>50%) that gradually shifts toward lymphocytes (>80%) over time.[2][4][7] For patients in the US presenting between June and September, it is advisable to test for West Nile virus IgM in the CSF or serum.[15] Significant differences exist between adults and children in the presentation and laboratory findings.[7] These differences often require specialized approaches in diagnosis and treatment tailored to each age group, emphasizing the importance of age-specific considerations in managing patients with aseptic meningitis. Adults typically report symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, malaise, and photophobia. They are more likely to exhibit nuchal rigidity during examinations compared to children. Fever, concurrent respiratory illness, and rash are signs and symptoms that are more commonly observed in children.[7] Just as physical findings can differ, adult patients tend to exhibit a higher CSF WBC count and elevated CSF protein levels in the initial CSF evaluation than the pediatric population. Conversely, children often present with more CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis and higher leukocyte counts than adults.[4][7] When interpreting CSF fluid results in neonates and young infants, applying age-adjusted values for leukocyte counts is crucial. In this population, up to 57% of children with aseptic meningitis exhibit a predominance of neutrophils in the CSF, emphasizing that relying solely on cell type cannot discriminate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis in children.[4] Drug-induced aseptic meningitis, in particular, can often present with few laboratory abnormalities. Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion and thoroughly assess the patient's medical history, including all medications they might be taking and their respective dosages.[2][4] While distinguishing between aseptic and bacterial meningitis can be challenging, specific tools have been developed to aid the diagnostic process. The bacterial meningitis score, with a sensitivity of 99% to 100% and a specificity of 52% to 62%, stands out as the most specific tool currently accessible. Other laboratory findings, such as procalcitonin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and CSF lactate levels, can provide valuable insights to differentiate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis.
