cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection are mild and resolve on their own. _M. pneumoniae_ can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and cerebral ataxia.[21] Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax, or even respiratory distress syndrome. A parapneumonic effusion can be associated with restricted chest expansion on the affected side. _C. pneumoniae_ infection commonly presents with a sore throat, cough, and headache, persisting for several weeks or even months. In some individuals, it can lead to pneumonia, otitis media, and bronchitis.[24] Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[46] Asymptomatic infection may also occur and may only be evidenced by serosurveys. _L. pneumophila_ can be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections. Several serotypes exist, and infection tends to occur in close quarters.[36] Human-to-human transmission is rare; most cases are due to inhalation of the pathogen from contaminated water sources such as humidifiers, whirlpools, respiratory therapy equipment, water faucets, and air conditioners.[32][33] Stagnant water provides an environment for organisms to proliferate. Individuals at risk for _Legionella_ may have diabetes mellitus, malignancy, renal or liver failure, and those who have recently undergone plumbing work at home.[38] Once acquired, patients may present with altered mental status, cough, fever, and respiratory distress. Of the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, _Legionella_ species are more likely to have a severe course, and the illness can quickly become severe if not treated promptly. Although extrapulmonary symptoms are rare, many patients develop severe respiratory distress, often requiring mechanical ventilation.[47] ## Evaluation In a nontoxic-appearing patient, particularly in the outpatient setting, a high clinical suspicion is sufficient to pursue empiric treatment. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis, and sputum Gram stain may show an accumulation of inflammatory cells without any identifiable organisms.[48] Urea levels may be elevated, and although leukocytosis may not always be present in most individuals, it is more likely to be elevated in older age groups. Other laboratory investigations, including serology and molecular testing, often complement and further help risk-stratify individuals and direct treatment.[1] In addition to assessing leukocytosis, some providers may evaluate a left-shift typical of legionellosis or perform a procalcitonin test to help differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However,\*\*\*\* the yield of pro-calcitonin in the clinical setting is often mixed.[49][50][51][52] _Legionella_ species infection
