myocardial glucose uptake. Additionally, a 12-hour fasting period is recommended before the FDG injection. In some cases, a heparin injection may be administered to further enhance myocardial fatty acid metabolism and improve image specificity. **Coronary angiography** This technique is considered the gold standard for ruling out CAD, particularly when the clinical presentation closely resembles that of acute coronary syndrome. In patients without conventional contraindications, CT coronary angiography may serve as an alternative diagnostic option. ## Treatment / Management **Management of Acute Myocarditis by Disease Stage** The management of acute myocarditis is tailored to the stage of the disease, as mentioned below. - Stage A: Patients in stage A are at risk for developing myocarditis. Management includes close monitoring for disease progression, strict avoidance of repeat exposure to known or suspected offending agents (eg, cocaine), and patient counseling on risk factors and preventive measures. - Stage B: In addition to the measures outlined in stage A, patients at stage B should undergo a timely reassessment of their symptoms. An ECG and high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) should be obtained if not already performed. Management includes addressing the underlying etiology, for example, initiating immunosuppressive therapy in patients receiving ICIs. Hospitalization may be warranted based on the severity of left ventricular dysfunction and the overall clinical context. - Stage C: At stage C, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure is implemented, which includes pharmacotherapy tailored to the underlying etiology (eg, immunosuppression or steroid use). EMB may be considered in selected patients based on clinical indications. Referral to an advanced heart failure center with a specialized myocarditis team is recommended. Patients should be restricted from strenuous activity for at least 3 to 6 months, while avoiding excessive sedentary behavior. Hospitalization is advised unless the clinical presentation is considered low-risk. - Stage D: Patients with stage D myocarditis require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and prompt referral to an advanced heart failure center with a dedicated myocarditis team. Management includes GDMT for heart failure, pharmacological treatment targeting the underlying etiology, and appropriate interventions for arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, including supportive measures or mechanical circulatory support. Strenuous physical activity should be restricted for at least 6 months. In cases where there is no recovery, consideration should be given to the placement of a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation.[5] **General Supportive Management Strategies of Acute Myocarditis** The management of acute myocarditis
