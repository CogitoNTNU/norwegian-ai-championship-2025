the gallbladder. Most patients will experience an increase in bile production by the liver and will see an improvement in symptoms over time. ## Consultations Clinicians frequently involved with the management of acalculous cholecystitis include: - General surgeon - Gastroenterologist - Radiologist ## Deterrence and Patient Education Deterrence of acalculous cholecystitis focuses on identifying and mitigating risk factors, particularly in critically ill patients. Educating healthcare team members and caregivers about the importance of early mobilization, minimizing prolonged fasting, and closely monitoring patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or experiencing rapid weight loss is essential. While direct patient education may be limited due to the typical ICU setting in which this condition arises, informing patients and families about potential complications of critical illness, including gallbladder issues, can aid in shared decision-making. Early recognition and proactive management remain key in preventing severe outcomes like gallbladder perforation or necrosis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of acute acalculous cholecystitis requires a coordinated, interprofessional approach due to the high acuity and complexity of the condition. Physicians, including intensivists and surgeons, must rapidly assess and stabilize critically ill patients, initiate timely diagnostic imaging, and determine the need for surgical intervention or percutaneous drainage. Advanced practitioners support this by performing thorough assessments, monitoring clinical progress, and facilitating communication among team members. Nurses play a critical role at the bedside, maintaining vigilant observation for subtle signs of deterioration, managing fluid balance, monitoring respiratory status, and ensuring adherence to preventive measures such as deep vein thrombosis and ulcer prophylaxis. Close collaboration with radiologists and gastroenterologists ensures timely procedural interventions, such as percutaneous cholecystostomy or ERCP-guided gallbladder decompression, when surgery is not immediately feasible. Pharmacists contribute by tailoring antimicrobial therapy to cover likely pathogens, adjusting dosages for organ dysfunction, and preventing medication-related complications. Dietitians assess nutritional needs, particularly for NPO patients who may require IV nutrition. Physical therapists provide bedside rehabilitation to prevent deconditioning and promote recovery in frail patients. Effective communication among all team members ensures consistent updates, accurate documentation, and shared decision-making centered around patient goals and safety. The complex nature of acalculous cholecystitis, combined with its high morbidity and mortality rate, underscores the need for seamless interprofessional collaboration, clear role delineation, and a unified focus on improving patient-centered outcomes and maximizing functional recovery despite the guarded prognosis.[18][28] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17050&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17050) - [Click here for a simplified
