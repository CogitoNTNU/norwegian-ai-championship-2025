symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with heart failure has been shown to improve functional status and quality of life and reduce hospitalizations for worsening heart failure.[67] **Thyroid-stimulating hormone:** Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states are underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure, and low triiodothyronine syndrome is commonly encountered in patients with HFpEF.[68] **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP):** Measurement of either natriuretic peptide is helpful to exclude or support a diagnosis of heart failure.[1] No scientific evidence exists to advocate using one test over another; using their respective values and endpoints interchangeably is inappropriate.[1] However, measuring natriuretic peptides in the outpatient setting in patients with dyspnea and an equivocal physical examination provides minimal diagnostic value.[1] Many cardiac and noncardiac conditions can cause elevation in natriuretic peptide levels, including advancing age, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease.[1] **Initial Evaluation: Noninvasive Testing and Cardiac Imaging** **12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG):** Electrocardiography is routinely performed to evaluate patients with suspected heart failure to obtain information regarding rate, rhythm, and ventricular conduction.[1] **Chest radiography:** A chest x-ray is indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected HFpEF.[69] Chest radiography permits the assessment of the cardiac silhouette and heart size, pulmonary airspaces, vascular congestion, and other thoracic disease processes that may contribute to exertional dyspnea.[1] **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE):** Echocardiography is perhaps the most helpful tool in diagnosing HFpEF and is strongly recommended.[1] The need to categorize heart failure is considered an indication to perform TTE.[70] Determination of LVEF is the critical step in classifying heart failure and guides evidence-based therapeutic interventions.[1] If TTE is inadequate, other cardiac imaging studies such as cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac computed tomography, or radionuclide imaging can be considered.[1] However, TTE provides a wealth of information in a noninvasive manner, including the size, function, motion, and geometry of all cardiac chambers and valves, estimates of LVFPs, and estimates of atrial, systolic pulmonary artery, and central venous pressures. ## Treatment / Management **Therapeutic Interventions in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction** The goals of therapy for HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, prevent disease progression, reduce hospitalizations, and effectively manage underlying comorbidities. To this end, lifestyle and behavioral modifications are a cornerstone of therapeutic intervention. **Lifestyle interventions** Several studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[71] Exercise training, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, and weight loss improve functional
