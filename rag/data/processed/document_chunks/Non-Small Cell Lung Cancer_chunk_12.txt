survival is approximately 20%. If a tumor is T4 due to ipsilateral nonprimary lobe nodules with no mediastinal involvement, then surgery alone renders five-year survival of 20% Stage IIIB tumors are treated the same way unresectable IIIA cancers are treated, with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. For a select few patients, post-induction chemo-radiotherapy, surgery might be an option. The trials on the survival of patients with IIIB tumors also included inoperable IIIA tumors; therefore, the survival in IIIB patients is unknown. **Stage IV** Stage IV disease is considered incurable, and therapy is aimed at improving survival and alleviating symptoms. Only 10% to 30% of patients respond to chemotherapy, and only 1% to 3% survive five years after diagnosis. Single or double drug-based chemotherapy is offered to patients with functional performance status. There is a small survival benefit from chemotherapy. In highly select patients, non-squamous NSCLC without brain metastasis or hemoptysis might benefit from the addition of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.[35] **Targeted Therapy for NSCLC** In the early 2000s, researchers discovered that specific mutations encode critical proteins for cell growth and replication. These mutations were named “driver mutations.” It was proposed that blocking these mutation pathways may improve survival in lung cancer patients. The current practice is to check for the following mutations in every advanced NSCLC. Each of these mutations has a specific inhibitor available: 1. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a mutation inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib.[36] 1. ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase) includes the specific inhibitors crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. A structurally similar mutation is ROS-1. The FDA recently approved crizotinib for treating cancers expressing ROS-1 mutation. **Immunotherapy for NSCLC** Immunotherapy boosts the immune system and helps it recognize cancer cells as foreign, and increases their responsiveness. There are several check-points to decrease autoimmunity and autodestruction of the body’s cells by the immune system. Malignant cells co-opt these check-points and create tolerance in the immune system. Of these check-points, programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) has been of particular interest recently. PD-1 plays an important role in down-regulating T-cells and promotes self-tolerance. However, it also renders the immune system less effective against tumor cells. PD-1 interacts with two proteins: PD-L1 and PD-L2. This binding results in the inactivation of activated T-cells. At the moment, there are antibodies approved for PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1 only. They inhibit the PD-1 receptor directly or bind to PD-L1,
