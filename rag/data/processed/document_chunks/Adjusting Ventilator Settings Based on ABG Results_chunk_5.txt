survival in patients with ARDS. - Appropriate PEEP levels: Applying PEEP helps prevent alveolar collapse and improves oxygenation. The PEEP level should be adjusted to optimize lung recruitment while avoiding overdistension. - Avoiding high plateau pressures: Plateau pressures lower than 30 cm H2O must be targeted. The plateau pressure is a measure of pulmonary compliance. - Avoiding high driving pressure: Monitoring and minimizing driving pressure—the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP—is essential for reducing the risk of VILI. Targeting a driving pressure below 15 cm H2O is associated with better outcomes.[17][18] **Bronchial Asthma** Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and variable airflow obstruction. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing which can vary over time and in intensity. Patients with asthma are at risk of dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP during mechanical ventilation.[19] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with bronchial asthma** Lower tidal volumes, slower respiratory rates, and shorter inspiratory times are recommended to allow for adequate exhalation time. Avoiding high PEEP levels is essential to prevent dynamic hyperinflation in patients with bronchial asthma.[20] **Restrictive Lung Diseases** Restrictive lung diseases are a diverse group of pulmonary disorders characterized by reduced lung distensibility, thus limiting lung expansion and decreasing lung volumes, particularly total lung capacity. Restrictive lung diseases can result from intrinsic factors, like interstitial lung diseases, or extrinsic factors, such as neuromuscular diseases, pleural disorders, obesity, and thoracic deformities that limit chest wall movement.[21] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with restrictive lung diseases** Patients with restrictive lung disease usually require higher PEEP levels to achieve adequate oxygenation and lower tidal volumes to prevent lung injury.[22] **Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema** Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the abnormal fluid accumulation in the lung parenchyma, impairing gas exchange at the alveolar level and potentially leading to respiratory failure. The condition occurs due to elevated hydrostatic pressure from conditions like left ventricular dysfunction, valvular disease, and arrhythmias.[23] **Ventilator adjustments in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema** High PEEP levels are used to reduce pulmonary edema and improve oxygenation. Noninvasive ventilation must be considered to reduce the need for invasive ventilation.[24] ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions Mechanical ventilation requires a collaborative, interprofessional approach to ensure optimal outcomes. Critical care nurses and respiratory therapists are pivotal in continuously monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings. These professionals must be familiar with interpreting ABG results and understanding the physiological implications
