is on the right side. When emergency physicians adopted ultrasound, it was for multiple applications from head to toe and included procedural guidance. Having a convention where the indicator on the screen is always to the left side, and the indicator on the probe is to the operator’s left (and up to 90 degrees clockwise from that position) keeps orientation consistent for the operator to perform and interpret, and is more practical for procedures. For this reason, the technique will be described with the latter convention. A low-frequency phased array probe is best for a cardiac ultrasound. There are four key views: **Subxiphoid** The phased array probe is placed inferior to the xiphoid process, indenting the skin one to two centimeters, with the indicator directed to the patient’s anatomical right and the footprint of the probe directed up towards the patient’s heart (handle of the probe parallel with the patient’s skin). Structures closest to the probe appear at the top of the screen, and structures further away appear towards the bottom of the screen, so in this view, the top of the screen is both anterior and inferior, and the bottom of the screen is more posterior and superior. For this reason, the left lobe of the liver is often visualized at the top of the screen, followed by the right atrium and right ventricle, and finally, the left atrium and left ventricle near the bottom of the screen. Adjust the depth to see the entire heart and interrogate for a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions are anechoic (black), and usually, encircle the heart when clinically significant. This view is often easy to obtain in thin patients, as well as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is more difficult in obese patients. Rotating the probe clockwise 90 degrees (so the indicator is pointing cephalad) allows visualization of the inferior vena cava emptying into the right atrium. **Parasternal Long Axis** The phased array probe is placed just to the anatomic left of the sternum at the four intercostal spaces, with the probe's handle perpendicular to the chest wall, an indicator of the patient’s right shoulder. In this view, the footprint of the probe is aligned with the long axis of the patient’s heart. The chamber closest to the footprint at the top of the screen (anterior aspect of the patient) is the right ventricle. The additional chambers include the left atrium,
