peak levels within 10 to 15 minutes after nasal insufflation and about 30 to 45 minutes following intramuscular injection. Fentanyl, which is the only available topical analgesic agent, often takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak levels. Most orally administered opiate is absorbed in the small intestine. Large opiate doses can lead to gastric aperistalsis and a delay in gastric emptying, resulting in increased absorption of the drug. Once in the body, opiates are metabolized by the liver into inactive compounds, which are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Opiates such as buprenorphine and fentanyl are highly lipid-soluble and tend to redistribute into fatty tissues, resulting in a prolonged half-life. Since all opiates are metabolized by the liver, they tend to have a long half-life when consumed in the presence of liver dysfunction (eg, cirrhosis). Opiate toxicity in patients with this condition can occur rapidly, even with small doses, as the drug remains in the body for an extended period. The hepatic microsomal CYP2D6 enzyme breaks down codeine into the active metabolite morphine. Some individuals carry more than 2 copies of the enzyme, making them ultrarapid metabolizers who quickly convert codeine into morphine. These people may develop morphine toxicity if they take even normal doses of codeine. This same mechanism of ultrarapid breakdown explains why tramadol may also cause opiate toxicity. After being metabolized in the liver, opiate metabolites are excreted in the urine. Individuals with renal dysfunction may experience adverse effects from the accumulation of active metabolites, such as normeperidine. Several studies indicate that long-acting opiates used for noncancer pain may increase the risk of adverse cardiac events compared to tricyclics or anticonvulsants. **Formulas of Opiates and Delivery** In the past, opiates were only available in oral and injectable formulations. Today, dermal, sublingual, and inhaler formulas are also sold in the market. Butorphanol comes in an intranasal form, and fentanyl is available both as a topical and an inhaler. The transdermal delivery of opiates like fentanyl has become widely accepted in healthcare settings for analgesic relief. This delivery route is preferred because drug levels take 4 to 6 hours to peak, and the elimination half-life is long, making it suitable for patients with chronic, continuous pain. Additionally, this route rarely precipitates toxicity because of the relatively prolonged, slow onset of action. However, the topical formulation of fentanyl can contribute to the toxicity of parenteral and oral opiates. Dextromethorphan was
