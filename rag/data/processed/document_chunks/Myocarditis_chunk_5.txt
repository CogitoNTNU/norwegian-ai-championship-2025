acute myocarditis. This framework integrates clinical judgment with targeted diagnostic tools to ensure a comprehensive and systematic assessment. - Step 1—Initial evaluation: When acute myocarditis is clinically suspected, the first step involves obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, cardiac biomarkers, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a transthoracic echocardiogram. Evaluation should also aim to identify or rule out underlying CAD when clinically indicated. - Step 2—Clinical triage: Patients should be triaged based on hemodynamic stability and symptom severity to determine the need for hospitalization, urgent referral to an advanced heart failure center, immediate arrhythmia management, or mechanical circulatory support. - Step 3—Definitive diagnostics: Cardiac MRI with T1 and T2 mapping is the key diagnostic tool essential for evaluating myocardial inflammation and injury. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should be considered in selected cases, particularly when the diagnosis is unclear or when specific histopathological subtypes are suspected. - Step 4—Therapeutic management: Management includes discontinuing the inciting agent, addressing the underlying cause, treating any arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, and enforcing temporary restrictions on strenuous activity, including competitive sports. - Step 5—Longitudinal surveillance: Follow-up involves serial monitoring with cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI with tissue mapping. When indicated, genetic counseling and testing should be incorporated. A comprehensive reevaluation is essential before clearing patients for return to high-intensity physical activity or competitive sports. According to the 2013 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and subsequent updates, a diagnosis of acute myocarditis is suspected when at least 1 clinical presentation is accompanied by a diagnostic finding from noninvasive testing. In asymptomatic individuals, at least 2 diagnostic criteria are required to establish the diagnosis. Clinical presentations may include chest pain, symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock. Diagnostic findings include electrocardiographic abnormalities, such as ST-T wave changes or PR segment depression (resembling pericarditis), ventricular arrhythmias, elevated cardiac biomarkers (such as troponin-I or creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB]), and left ventricular dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities that are not consistent with a coronary artery distribution on the echocardiogram. Additional supportive findings include a cardiac MRI consistent with the updated Lake Louise criteria and increased patchy or diffuse fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET), both of which are indicative of myocardial inflammation.[1] **Diagnostic Investigations for Myocarditis** The tests mentioned below are commonly used to evaluate patients with suspected myocarditis: **Complete blood count** CBC may reveal leukocytosis; eosinophilia can be seen in cases of eosinophilic myocarditis. **Inflammatory reactants**
