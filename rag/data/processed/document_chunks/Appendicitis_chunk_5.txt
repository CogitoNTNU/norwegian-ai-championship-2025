are not diagnostic. Dunphy sign is the finding of increased abdominal pain with coughing or performing any activity that increases intra-abdominal pressure. Rovsing sign is pain in the right lower quadrant elicited by palpation or pressure of the left lower quadrant. A positive psoas sign is right lower quadrant pain with right hip extension or right thigh flexion against resistance. This pain occurs due to irritation of the psoas muscle by the inflamed appendix. Patients often flex the hip to shorten the muscle to relieve this pain.[19] The time course of symptoms in acute appendicitis is highly variable; symptoms typically escalate gradually from the onset of appendicitis and may progress for 12 to 24 hours. However, it is important to note that in complicated appendicitis cases, symptoms can be prolonged and extend beyond 48 hours. Approximately 75% of patients with acute appendicitis present within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. The risk of appendiceal rupture can vary, with about 2% of cases rupturing around 36 hours from the onset of symptoms. This risk tends to increase by approximately 5% for every additional 12 hours that pass without appropriate medical intervention. Following appendiceal perforation, additional complications can arise. These complications may include pylephlebitis, pylethrombosis, hydroureteronephrosis, bowel obstruction, and the formation of internal fistulae. These internal fistulae can involve various structures such as the bladder, vagina, uterus, or skin. These complications may result in resistant fever and significant weight loss.[20] ## Evaluation **Laboratory Testing** The laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis should include a total leukocyte count with differential and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.[21] The white blood cell (WBC) count and CRP concentration have a positive predictive value when used together to differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis.\*\*\*\* A combination of a normal WBC count and a normal CRP value has a high negative predictive value for acute appendicitis. Increasing CRP and WBC levels significantly increases the likelihood of complicated appendicitis.[22] Leukocytosis is present in approximately two-thirds of patients with acute appendicitis. A left shift or bandemia may accompany this increase in WBC count. While no laboratory value can confirm or exclude acute appendicitis, most patients with acute appendicitis will have a WBC count of >10,000 cells/mm3. Accordingly, a WBC count â‰¥17,000 cells/mm3 is associated with complicated acute appendicitis. **Imaging** Appendicitis is primarily diagnosed based on clinical evaluation and examination. However, imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT),
