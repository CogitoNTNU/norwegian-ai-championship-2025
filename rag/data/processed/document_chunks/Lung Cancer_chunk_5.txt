stroke-like symptoms secondary to brain metastasis, paraneoplastic syndrome, and kidney stones due to persistent hypercalcemia.[19] Cough is present in 50 to 75% of patients with lung cancer.[2] Cough productive of large volumes of thin, mucoid secretions is seen in mucinous adenocarcinoma. In some cases, especially those with exophytic bronchial masses, a cough may signify secondary post-obstructive pneumonia. Hemoptysis is present in 15 to 30% of patients with lung cancer.[2] Chest pain is present in approximately 20 to 40% of patients with lung cancer, and dyspnea may be present in as many as 25 to 40% of the cases at the time of diagnosis.[2] These symptoms, however, may be primarily due to lung cancer or due to underlying bronchopulmonary disease. Pleural involvement in lung cancer can manifest as pleural thickening/nodules or a malignant pleural effusion. During the course of their illness, approximately 10 to 15% of patients with lung cancer will have a malignant pleural effusion, with some showing a unilateral pleural effusion as the only presenting feature.[20] Bronchogenic carcinoma with associated ipsilateral malignant pleural effusion is considered unresectable; however, it must be noted that not all pleural effusions in patients with lung cancer are malignant.[21] A benign pleural effusion may occur due to lymphatic obstruction, post-obstructive pneumonitis, or atelectasis. If two consecutive cytology specimens are negative for malignancy in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, surgical thoracoscopy or medical pleuroscopy is recommended to evaluate the pleural space before surgical resection of a primary lesion.[22] Medical pleuroscopy has a sensitivity of greater than 90% for detecting malignancy when present in patients with bronchogenic carcinomas.[23] Superior vena cava syndrome with dilated neck veins, edema of the face, neck, and upper extremities, and a plethoric appearance is a common feature of small cell lung cancer. It might be the primary presentation of the disease. The chest radiograph will show widening of the mediastinum or a right hilar mass.[24] As stated above, lung cancers in the superior sulcus present as Pancoast syndrome. This presents as shoulder pain, Horner syndrome, and evidence of bony destruction, with atrophy of hand muscles. Metastasis from lung cancer to bone is frequently symptomatic, and patients may present with bone pain at the site of metastasis in the setting of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and hypercalcemia. Up to 20% of the patients with non-small cell lung cancer may have bone pain secondary to metastasis on initial presentation;[25] whereas the percentage is as
