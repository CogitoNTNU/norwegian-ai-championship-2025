for the use of stress echocardiography is the suspicion for coronary artery disease. This includes patients with stable angina with intermediate probability for coronary artery disease, with a pre-test probability of 15% to 85%.[10] This includes Suspected CAD with negative cardiac troponin and/or non-diagnostic ECG. If a patient has unstable angina and/or increasing troponin levels, the decision may be made to proceed with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention instead of stress testing. Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is used because it provides a superior imaging quality of the posterior heart chambers and structures when compared to TTE, can be used during coronary artery bypass graft surgery, aids in placement of transcatheter devices, and may be performed at the bedside in clinically ill patients.[11] This includes assessing valvular structures when the diagnosis of Infective endocarditis is suspected, or pre-operative evaluations of thrombus prior to cardioversion. TTE is a good initiate test of choice to evaluate cardiac structures for vegetation seen in infective endocarditis; however, if clinical suspicion is high, a TEE must be obtained to properly evaluate the valves and associated valvular structures. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is used during transcatheter cardiac interventions. This includes closure of atrial septal defects, catheter-directed biopsy, thrombectomies, and during electrophysiological procedures, which include transeptal puncture.[12] As ICE obtains images from within the heart, higher resolution images are obtained to help guide catheter-directed procedures. Due to advances in TEE, there has been limited use for ICE; however, as there has been an increase in transvenous catheter procedures, ICE is being considered further.[12] Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be performed during cardiac catheterization to directly visualize atherosclerosis within the vessel walls; this is utilized when the extent and severity of stenosis are indeterminant during PCI.[13] Clinical trials have found improved luminal gains, decreased re-stenosis, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), and the need for revascularization when compared to angiography alone. To overcome the limitations of both angiography and IVUS, the use of both during the same intervention can provide more accurate reconstructions of plaques size and volume.[14] Strain rate (STR) Echocardiography, also known as deformation echocardiography, is indicated when there is high suspicion for wall motion abnormalities. However, TTE is initially used to evaluate wall abnormalities; it is based on visual estimates, which may be subjective because it is operator dependant.[15] If TTE imaging is not clear or evident enough, ST and STR echocardiography may be utilized as an adjunct for a more accurate
