Type 1 respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system cannot adequately provide oxygen to the body, leading to hypoxemia, and can be caused by alveolar hypoventilation, low atmospheric pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen, diffusion defect, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and right-to-left shunt. Type 2 respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system cannot adequately remove carbon dioxide from the body, leading to hypercapnia, and can be caused by respiratory pump failure and increased carbon dioxide production. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of respiratory failure and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Review the etiology of respiratory failure. - Explain the pathophysiology of respiratory failure. - Review the physical exam findings associated with respiratory failure. - Summarize the treatment considerations for patients with respiratory failure.

Specifically, the respiratory system provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the body. The inability of the respiratory system to perform either or both of these tasks results in respiratory failure. Type 1 respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system cannot adequately provide oxygen to the body, leading to hypoxemia. Type 2 respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system cannot sufficiently remove carbon dioxide from the body, leading to hypercapnia. Respiratory failure can be classified based on chronicity (i.e., acute, chronic, and acute on chronic). A thorough understanding of respiratory failure is crucial to managing this disorder. If either type of respiratory failure is not identified and addressed early, it will become life-threatening and lead to respiratory arrest, coma, and death. The approach to adult patients with suspected respiratory failure (both hypercapnia and hypoxic), as well as the diagnosis and treatment of
