- Peptic ulcer disease - Cholelithiasis - Biliary obstruction - Acute pancreatitis - Pancreatic cancer - Pancreatic pseudocyst - Chronic mesenteric ischemia - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth - Enteric bacterial infection - Short bowel syndrome - Inflammatory bowel disease - Celiac disease - Lactose or other food intolerances - Bile acid malabsorption - Parasites (especially giardia) Other potential reasons for persistent symptoms include insufficient dosing, lack of compliance, inadequate timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy administration, and poor diet.[38] A comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and lifestyle factors is essential to identify the underlying cause and tailor the treatment approach accordingly. ## Prognosis Several factors, including the age at diagnosis, ongoing alcohol and tobacco use, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as end-stage liver disease, influence the prognosis of chronic pancreatitis. Many individuals with chronic pancreatitis experience a diminished quality of life due to the high rates of complications associated with the condition. A longitudinal study conducted between 1997 and 2019, which followed 161 patients who underwent operative management for chronic pain or local complications, found that long-term survival rates were generally favorable.[39] However, most deaths were attributed to alcohol- and smoking-related diseases rather than chronic pancreatitis itself,[39] highlighting the significant impact of lifestyle factors on the long-term prognosis of the disease. ## Complications Chronic pancreatitis can lead to various complications due to ongoing pancreatic damage and dysfunction. These complications include the following: - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which typically occurs later in the course of chronic pancreatitis, often no sooner than 5 years after diagnosis. - Pseudocyst formation, which, if adjacent to the stomach, can be drained via EUS with pigtail stent placement; laparoscopic or open surgery is rarely necessary. - Recurrent acute pancreatitis, especially in alcoholics who continue to drink and smoke. - Splenic venous thrombosis is potentially complicated by gastric varices or gastric varices disproportionate to esophageal varices. - Pancreatic ascites or pleural effusion (rare). - Pseudoaneurysms (rarely involving vessels near the pancreas). - Pancreatic diabetes occurs in about 30% of chronic pancreatitis patients. - An increased risk of developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol use should be encouraged to avoid alcohol and quit smoking, as both worsen the progression of the disease. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is essential in advanced chronic pancreatitis with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to improve fat and protein maldigestion.
