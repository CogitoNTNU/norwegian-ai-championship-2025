anticoagulation should be assessed at the end of 3 months by considering the patient's bleeding risk. Those with a high bleeding risk can limit therapy to 3 months. Special considerations are required for patients with active cancer, given their increased risk for a VTE event. Hence, cancer patients should receive an extended duration of anticoagulation if their bleeding risk remains acceptable (low or moderate bleeding risk). For cancer patients with PE, LMWH, and direct oral anticoagulants (eg, apixaban and rivaroxaban) are preferred over VKA.[84] ## Differential Diagnosis Since PE has a very heterogeneous clinical presentation ranging from dyspnea to sudden cardiac arrest.[85] The differential diagnosis of PE is extensive and includes: - Acute coronary syndrome - Stable angina - Acute pericarditis - Congestive heart failure - Malignancy - Cardiac arrhythmias - Pneumonia - Pneumonitis - Pneumothorax - Vasovagal syncope ## Prognosis Shock and right ventricular dysfunction confer a poor prognosis and predict mortality in patients diagnosed with PE.[63] Patients with PE and a coexisting DVT are also at an increased risk for death. While earlier reports reported a high rate of mortality following pulmonary infarction, a study from 2018 found the survival to discharge rate of those suffering from a pulmonary infarction to be high at around 97%.[86] Several prognostic models have been designed, but the PE Severity Index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) are the most commonly used. The PESI score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with an established diagnosis of PE.[87] The principal strength of the PESI and sPESI is identifying patients at low risk for 30-day mortality (PESI classes I and II). **Original and Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index** The following parameters are utilized in each version of the PESI (original version [87]/simplified version [88]): - Age: 1 point (if age older than 80 years) - Male sex: +10 points/– - Cancer: +30 points/1 point - Chronic heart failure: +10 points/1 point - Chronic pulmonary disease: +10 points/1 point - Pulse rate ≥110 bpm: +20 points/1 point - Systolic BP \<100 mm Hg: +30 points/1 point - Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min: +20 points/– - Temperature \<36 °C: +20 points/– - Altered mental status: +60 points/– - Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation \<90%: +20 points/1 point Risk Stratification in PESI includes the following classes: - Class I: Points ≤65; low 30-day mortality risk from 1% to 6%. - Class II: Points 66 to 85; low mortality risk from 1.7%
