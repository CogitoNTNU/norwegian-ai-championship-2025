available for cardioversion therapy and include synchronized electric cardioversion or chemical cardioversion with medications including flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, or dronedarone. Maze procedure is usually reserved for the patient undergoing other cardiac surgery. - Atrial Flutter[6] Mechanism: Reentrant circuit usually around the tricuspid annulus in the right atrium. Signs & Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic, or it can cause palpitation, shortness of breath, or hypotension. EKG Findings: Regular tachycardia with Saw-tooth appearance of P wave with a variable degree of AV block. Management: General goals include control of ventricular rate with AV blocking agents (beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers), but the restoration of sinus rhythm through cardioversion or ablation is preferred. - Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) Mechanism: multiple automatic atrial foci due to increased sympathetic tone secondary to various causes, including hypoxemia (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or stimulant use. Signs & Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. Patients will have symptoms of the underlying illness, such as dyspnea. EKG Findings: Three or more P wave morphologies with different PR intervals. Management: Oxygen therapy if hypoxemic and treatment of the underlying cause. Refractory cases: Rate Control with calcium channel blockers as the first choice in the setting of COPD followed by beta-blockers. - Junctional tachycardia:[7] Arrhythmia originating from or near the AV node. Mechanism: Rhythm arising from the AV node. Risk Factors: Post cardiac surgery, myocardial ischemia (or during reperfusion), or digoxin toxicity. Signs & Symptoms: Usually well-tolerated and asymptomatic. EKG Findings: Inverted P Wave in the lead 2 with short PR or No P waves with a narrow complex. Management: Treat the underlying cause. \*\*\*\* IV.**Ventricular Tachycardia:** Origin is below the AV node. It is the major cause of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States. a) Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia:[8]\*\*\*\* When the rapid ventricular rhythm terminates on its own within 30 seconds. Mechanism: Channelopathies secondary to structural abnormality, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic imbalance, and the effect of pro-arrhythmic drugs. Risk Factors: Structural or ischemic heart disease. Signs & Symptoms: Asymptomatic or palpitations. EKG Findings: Monomorphic wide complex with more than three beats in a row but lasts less than three seconds. Management: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and/or medical therapy. b) Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia Mechanism: Presence of damaged fibers in ischemic heart disease leading to re-entry of current. Some patients do not have structural heart disease. Approximately 10% of the cases are idiopathic. Risk Factors: Structural heart disease and post-myocardial infarction. Signs & Symptoms: Palpitation, hypotension, or
