clinical testing.[19] POC devices are increasingly used for HbA1c measurement in clinical settings. However, the diversity of available POC systems complicates selection, as comparative performance data are limited. Notably, POC measurements typically yield values approximately 0.5% lower than laboratory-based assays and may exhibit reduced accuracy compared to venous blood samples analyzed in a laboratory. Inter-laboratory variability in HbA1c results can reach 0.5%, underscoring the importance of standardized methodologies to ensure reliable clinical outcomes.[20][21] ## Interfering Factors Several conditions can interfere with the accuracy of HbA1c testing. Individuals with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, anemia, kidney failure, liver disease, or those receiving blood transfusions can experience altered results due to the longevity of the red blood cell. HbA1c measurement in these patients must be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with plasma glucose samples to diagnose diabetes mellitus.[22] A falsely low HbA1c value can result from several conditions, including high altitude, pregnancy, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, erythropoietin administration, iron supplementation, hemolytic anemia, chronic kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, sickle cell anemia, and spherocytosis. Vitamin C supplementation can increase or decrease HbA1c levels depending on the method used.[23][24] Conversely, a falsely high HbA1c value can be due to insufficient iron in the blood. This condition can result from iron deficiency anemia, infection-induced or tumor-induced anemia. In addition, hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and B12 deficiency can cause a falsely high HbA1c value.[25][26] Other causes of falsely high HbA1c levels include hypertriglyceridemia, organ transplantation, and hyperglycation in certain ethnic groups. Medications such as immunosuppressants and protease inhibitors can sometimes lead to a falsely high HbA1c value.[22][27][28] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings The HbA1c percentage reflects the average glucose level in a patient's body over the past 90 days.[29][30][31] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK549816/table/article-22729.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK549816/table/article-22729.table0/?report=objectonly) Table. Relationship Between HbA1c and Average Glucose Levels. ## Clinical Significance HbA1c is a well-established marker that reflects average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months and serves as a reliable indicator of long-term glycemic control.[2] HbA1c\*\*\*\* is widely used not only for monitoring diabetes mellitus but also as a diagnostic tool and an alternative to glucose testing for screening diabetes mellitus. Glycated hemoglobin has been firmly recognized as a predictor of the risk of developing microvascular complications, such as retinopathy and nephropathy, in patients with diabetes mellitus.[32][33] Notably, the absolute risks of these complications are directly proportional to the mean HbA1c concentration. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of diabetic retinopathy increases
