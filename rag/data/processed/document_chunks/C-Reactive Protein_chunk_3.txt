in predicting VTE risk.[13] Log-transformed hsCRP-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (Ln HCHR) and log-transformed hsCRP-to-lymphocyte count ratio (Ln HCLR) show a positive association with the prevalence of heart failure in the U.S. population.[14] Higher CRP levels serve as independent risk factors for cardiac mortality and are directly proportional to the risk of cardiovascular disease. Elevated CRP plasma levels also correlate with cancer risk, with higher levels observed in gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer. Elevated CRP may serve as a potential biomarker for stratifying cancer risk.[15] In patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, increased CRP levels independently associate with a heightened risk of both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).[16] Frailty, characterized by multisystem dysregulation, decreased resilience, reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to stressors, is emerging as closely linked to low-grade chronic inflammation. Higher levels of hsCRP correlate with an increased risk of frailty progression.[17] ## Normal and Critical Findings Laboratory values for CRP vary, with no standardized reporting method currently in use. Results are typically presented in either mg/dL or mg/L, with hsCRP commonly reported in mg/dL. The standard interpretation of CRP levels is as follows: - Less than 0.3 mg/dL: Normal, typically observed in most healthy adults - 0.3 to 1.0 mg/dL: Normal or minor elevation, often seen in conditions such as obesity, pregnancy, depression, diabetes, common cold, gingivitis, periodontitis, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and genetic polymorphisms - 1.0 to 10.0 mg/dL: Moderate elevation, commonly associated with systemic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, other autoimmune diseases, malignancies, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, and bronchitis - More than 10.0 mg/dL: Marked elevation, typically linked to acute bacterial infections, viral infections, systemic vasculitis, and major trauma - More than 50.0 mg/dL: Severe elevation, generally seen in acute bacterial infections When used for cardiac risk stratification, hsCRP levels are interpreted as follows: - Below 1 mg/dL: Low cardiovascular risk - Between 1 and 3 mg/dL: Moderate cardiovascular risk - Above 3 mg/dL: High cardiovascular risk [18][19] The interpretation of CRP levels is essential for assessing the degree of inflammation and associated risks in patients. Clinicians can use these values to monitor disease progression, guide treatment strategies, and identify potential complications. ## Interfering Factors Certain pharmacological agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins, can reduce CRP levels. Recent injury or illness may elevate levels, particularly when using the test for cardiac risk
