to the small tissue size to microscopically characterize the lung tissue and the peripheral nature of the disease. However, it may help exclude alternative diagnoses such as sarcoidosis or infection. A biopsy should be performed either by thoracotomy or a minimally invasive approach, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, to obtain adequate tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.[5] Peri-procedural respiratory infections are the most common complication (approximately 6.5%), with a surgical lung biopsy mortality rate estimated at 1.7%. Other potential complications include ILD exacerbation, bleeding, prolonged air leak, neuropathic pain, and delayed wound healing (less than 5%).[5] The suitability of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) for each patient may vary. Recently, the American Thoracic Society guidelines provided recommended criteria to guide when a patient is suitable for TBLC or surgical lung biopsy. Patients with severe lung function derangement, such as FVC less than 50% predicted, DlCO less than 35%, moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension (estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure >40 mm Hg), uncorrectable bleeding risk, or significant hypoxemia (PaO2 \<55-60 mm Hg) are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes and are considered relative contraindications.[40] A study suggested that TBLC could be a viable option for certain patients at a higher risk for major complications, especially when performed at centers with a higher volume of cases. A study involving 699 patients who underwent TBLC revealed that both the pathological and final multidisciplinary diagnostic yields were lower in individuals with FVC lower than 50% and/or a DLCO less than 35%. However, no statistically significant differences in complication rates were observed between the 2 groups.[41] The utility of bronchoalveolar lavage in suspected IPF falls within the intermediate probability of UIP clinically and radiological when other alternative causes are not ruled out and require a cell analysis to narrow down the differential diagnosis.[5] **Multidisciplinary Discussion** The multidisciplinary team's discussion involves interactions among radiologists, pathologists, and pulmonologists, with rheumatologists when needed, to improve the diagnostic agreement for IPF.[42] Multidisciplinary discussions enhance diagnostic accuracy and serve a critical role in the detection of this condition. When the outcomes of clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and HRCT do not lead to a confident diagnosis of IPF after the MMD, a lung biopsy may be necessary. ## Treatment / Management Previous research has shown that patients in advanced stages of IPF experience a more rapid decline in lung function despite receiving treatment. As a result, it is crucial to diagnose IPF in
