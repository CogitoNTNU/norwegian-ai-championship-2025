severity, and coordinating care plans. These specialists collaborate closely with cardiothoracic surgeons who perform procedures to treat complex cases or prevent recurrence. Radiologists provide expertise in interpreting imaging studies, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Pathologists analyze fluid and tissue samples to confirm diagnoses and rule out malignancies or infections. Additional specialists, such as oncologists, infectious disease experts, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and hepatologists, may be involved depending on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion. Respiratory therapists offer respiratory care and assist in managing symptoms through techniques such as breathing exercises and oxygen therapy. Nurses play a crucial role in patient education, care coordination, and monitoring patient progress throughout treatment. Physical therapists develop tailored exercise programs to optimize lung function and mobility, particularly following procedures. By working collaboratively, this interprofessional team ensures that patients with pleural effusions receive comprehensive, personalized care to enhance outcomes and quality of life.[25][26] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20929&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20929) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/pleural-effusion/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20929) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20929/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20929) [![Bilateral Pleural Effusions on Chest Computed Tomography](/books/NBK448189/bin/bilateral__pleural__effusions.gif)](/books/NBK448189/figure/article-20929.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK448189/figure/article-20929.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Bilateral Pleural Effusions on Chest Computed Tomography. This chest computed tomography shows bilateral pleural effusions draining toward the dependent posterior pleural regions (the patient is supine).
