due to medication side effects, proper medication education for all patients is essential. ## Pearls and Other Issues **Pearls and Key Issues** 1. Pulseless VT is a medical emergency that requires immediate defibrillation. 1. The energy of 150-200 J on biphasic and 360 J on monophasic defibrillator should be used. 1. Delaying defibrillation of pulseless VT dramatically decreases the survival rate. 1. Critical interventions in the post-arrest phase are coronary angiography and PCI. 1. Implantation of ICD is indicated both for primary and secondary prevention of VT/V-fib. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Pulseless ventricular tachycardia is a life-threatening arrhythmia. Early recognition and prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation with defibrillation can be life-saving and may also prevent lifelong complications. Interprofessional healthcare teams usually include nurses, physicians, mid-level providers, anesthesia, respiratory therapists and pharmacists. Effective communication between all members of the healthcare team is essential for early initiation of life-saving measures in patients who develop pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Each minute in treatment delay decreases the chance of survival by approximately 10%.[21] Continuing medical education keeps providers and medical staff up to date on The American Heart Association ACLS protocol, and all healthcare team members need to be certified and remain current. In persons who recover, prompt evaluation by a cardiologist is essential for the prevention of recurrent arrhythmias and complications. [Level 1] A board-certified cardiology pharmacist will play a vital role in these cases, given the nature of the drugs involved. They will consult with the cardiology team on agent selection, appropriate dosing, check for interactions, and provide direction to nursing staff on adverse events. Nursing will monitor the patient after assisting in the emergency procedures upon arrival at the healthcare facility. These interprofessional actions will increase survival in cases of pulseless VT. [Level 5] Bystander CPR and public access to a defibrillator have helped increase the survival rate of out of hospital cardiac arrest, although survival remains under 10%.[22] Once the patient has arrived at the hospital, temperature control, and cardio-cerebral resuscitation measure further improve overall survival.[22] [Level 1] Regardless of the location, early recognition and prompt initiation of advanced cardiac life support protocol are crucial elements to survival. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28074&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28074) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/pulseless-ventricular-tachycardia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28074) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28074/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28074) [![Ventricular Tachycardia rhythm example Contributed by Tammy J](/books/NBK554467/bin/Ventricular__Tachycardia.gif)](/books/NBK554467/figure/article-28074.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK554467/figure/article-28074.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Ventricular Tachycardia rhythm example Contributed by Tammy J.
