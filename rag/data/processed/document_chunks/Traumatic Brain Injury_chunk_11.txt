outcome, with patients presenting a GCS of less than eight having a significantly higher mortality risk. CT imaging of the brain is the gold standard in assessing and risk-stratifying those with TBI. There are two well-known scoring systems, Marshall and Rotterdam, that utilize imaging findings to help predict complications, mortality, and the need for neurosurgical intervention. The Marshall score was the first in 1991, followed by the Rotterdam score system in 2005. [49][50] The Rotterdam score uses the presence of epidural lesions, intraventricular blood, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for scoring and outperforms the Marshall score utilizing the following components: intraventricular blood or subarachnoid hemorrhage is graded as 0 (absent) or 1 (present), the basal cistern is graded as 0 (normal), 1 (compressed), or 2 (absent), the epidural mass lesion is graded as 0 (absent) or 1 (present), and the midline shift is graded as 0 (no shift or shift < 5mm) or 1 (shift > 5mm). Those with a score of 1 have been found to have lower mortality, 3.2%, while those with a score of 6 can have mortalities of almost 80%.[51] Research studies such as the International Mission for Prognosis And Clinical Trial (IMPACT), TRACK-TBI, and CENTER-TBI have developed prognostic scoring systems to aid outcome prediction.[6][52] Interestingly, genomics plays a role in head trauma outcomes, with approximately 25% of the variance attributed to genetic factors.[21] Advancements in patient management now include the monitoring of partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) and cerebral metabolism through microdialysis, alongside focused management of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).[53] The importance of early and continuous rehabilitation in improving long-term clinical outcomes cannot be overstated, emphasizing the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to precision medicine.[21] Additionally, machine learning is emerging as a valuable tool in predicting adverse outcomes and mortality.[54][55][56] For mild traumatic brain injury(concussion), potential physical sequelae include postconcussive syndrome, which is thought to occur in 80% of patients; second impact syndrome, a rare disorder that results in rapid cerebral edema and high mortality; posttraumatic epilepsy; and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In those suffering from sports-related mild TBI (concussion), most symptoms (>70%) resolve within three days to two weeks, with the rest improving within four weeks.[57][58] Although adolescent females have a higher incidence rate and risk of injury from sport-related concussions, adolescent females and males usually recover at the same rate following TBI.
