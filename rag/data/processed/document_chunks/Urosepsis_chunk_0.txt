Urosepsis is sepsis caused by infections of the urinary tract, including cystitis, or lower urinary tract and bladder infections, and pyelonephritis, or upper urinary tract and kidney infections. Nearly 25 percent of sepsis cases originate from the urogenital tract. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and presentation of urosepsis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the pathophysiology of urosepsis. - Review the presentation of a patient with urosepsis. - Summarize the treatment and management options available for urosepsis. - Explain the importance of the interprofessional team in ensuring appropriate antibiotic administration in the management of patients with urosepsis.

Sepsis and the associated inflammatory response can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Urosepsis, as the name implies, is sepsis originating from the urogenital tract.[1][2] ## Etiology The most common pathogen causing urinary tract infections (UTIs), and in turn urosepsis, is _Escherichia coli_ (50%), followed by _Proteus_(15%), _Enterobacter_(15%), _Klebsiella_(15%), _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ (5%), and gram-positive bacteria (15%).[3][4] ## Epidemiology In the United States, the number of sepsis cases appears to be increasing over the last 30 to 40 years, but the overall mortality of patients from sepsis has declined. It is estimated that the mortality rate from urosepsis is 30% to 40%. The severity of the disease also appears to be increasing and is typically associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).[5][6] ## Pathophysiology A UTI begins with the colonization of the urethral meatus or vaginal introitus by either uropathogens or fecal flora that ascends via the urethra to the bladder. It may also ascend further up to the kidneys via the ureters and cause pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis also can be caused by bacterial seeding of the kidneys
