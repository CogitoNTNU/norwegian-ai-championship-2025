mm Hg are highly suspicious of ACS and should be correlated clinically. It is recommended that pressure measurements be trended every 6 hours to identify worsening IAH when there is potential for the development of ACS. Contraindications to using bladder pressures include bladder trauma, neurogenic bladder, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and pelvic hematoma.[24][25] Pelvic fracture, bladder hematoma, and peritoneal adhesions will lead to inaccurate measurements.[23] If bladder measurements are unavailable, other screening methods for IAH include placement of a central line to measure IVC pressure, manometry through a Jackson-Pratt drain, and intragastric pressure measurement through a nasogastric tube. These are not well-validated and not commonly used methods.[23] ## Treatment / Management Choosing the appropriate intervention and timing of the intervention is determined by the etiology of the elevated IAP, the duration of increased IAP, and the degree of organ dysfunction. Not every patient with ACS will immediately need surgical decompression, as nonsurgical interventions can decrease intra-abdominal volume and ultimately improve IAP. If clinically indicated, intraluminal volume can be reduced with nasogastric decompression, rectal tube decompression, or endoscopic decompression. Percutaneous drainage can reduce extraluminal volume in the case of ascites or hematoma.[5][20][23] Abdominal wall compliance can be improved with adequate sedation and neuromuscular blockade, removal of constrictive dressings, and eschar release, among other options. Other recommendations made by the WSACS include optimizing fluid administration, resuscitating with hypertonic products or colloids, consideration of hemodialysis or ultrafiltration, and goal-directed resuscitation.[5] However, the quality of evidence is low and needs to be considered when using conservative measures.[14] Percutaneous catheter drainage is a viable option for ACS caused by increased extraluminal abdominal volume. It is far less invasive than a surgical laparotomy and can also be used temporarily if surgical decompression is not an immediate option. Excess extraluminal abdominal volume is caused by excess air, fluid, or blood in the abdominal cavity.[20] If conservative medical management does not lead to improved IAH and further organ damage is noted, surgical decompression using emergent laparotomy should be considered.[2][26] With surgical abdominal decompression, organ dysfunction may also improve rapidly, as most organ dysfunction is seen as a direct sequelae from compromised blood flow or mechanical obstruction.[27][28] After surgical decompression, the abdominal fascia may be left open temporarily. The open wound is often covered by a negative pressure dressing system, which helps minimize the risks of infections and fistulas, decreases insensible losses, and prevents retraction of the fascia.
