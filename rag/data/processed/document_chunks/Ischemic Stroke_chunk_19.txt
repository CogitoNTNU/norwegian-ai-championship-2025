pressure ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Early rehabilitation for stroke patients is beneficial, although very early rehabilitation, within 24 hours, should be avoided. The AVERT trial randomized patients to receive very early rehabilitation within 24 hours of stroke compared to usual stroke-unit care, and early mobilization demonstrated less favorable outcomes using the modified Rankin score.[71] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Deterrence and prevention strategies play a vital role in reducing the incidence and impact of ischemic stroke. By addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking through lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, individuals can significantly decrease their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Additionally, raising awareness about the warning signs of stroke and promoting timely access to medical care for symptoms such as sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking can expedite treatment and minimize damage. Community-based education campaigns emphasizing healthy behaviors, regular exercise, and balanced diets further contribute to stroke prevention efforts. Through comprehensive efforts targeting both individual behaviors and societal factors, it is possible to mitigate the burden of ischemic stroke and enhance overall public health. ## Pearls and Other Issues Clinical pearls that offer valuable insights into the management and care of patients with ischemic stroke include the following: - Have a low threshold for evaluation of stroke, especially in at-risk populations. TIME IS BRAIN! - Stroke symptoms depend on the ischemic area of the brain and, therefore, vary. - Noncontrast head CT is the first imaging indicated for acute stroke, mainly to rule out hemorrhage. - Consider TPA or TNK if thrombotic CVA is identified within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. - When indicated, an early CT angiogram or MR angiogram with perfusion study should be obtained to look for LVO and initiate endovascular thrombectomy therapy within 6 to 24 hours. - Be aware of presenting blood pressure. Blood pressure management recommendations may include aggressive blood pressure management or permissive hypertension, depending on the type of stroke and whether IV fibrinolytic is indicated. - Start an antiplatelet agent within 24 hours of presentation. - Consider other risk factor management, including addressing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmias that may increase the risk of vascular disease or a thrombotic event. - Consider early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy after the onset of CVA. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The effective management of ischemic stroke demands a cohesive and interprofessional healthcare team dedicated to delivering patient-centered
