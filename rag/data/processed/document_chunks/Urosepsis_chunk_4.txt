and death.[18] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients with risk factors for UTIs should be encouraged to seek care promptly if they develop symptoms of a UTI. Patients should also be made aware of the importance of adhering to their prescribed medication regimen. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Urosepsis is best managed with an interprofessional team of health professionals that include a nephrologist, infectious disease expert, urologist, intensivist, a nurse, and a pharmacist. The key to preventing high morbidity is to prevent the condition that promotes infection. Any urological abnormality that is present needs to be corrected. The pharmacist should ensure that there is no delay in the administration of the antibiotics. The nurse should closely monitor the patient for signs of sepsis and communicate with the healthcare provider. Many of these patients require ICU care with close monitoring and frequent radiological studies. [Level 5][19][20] **Outcomes** The outcomes after urosepsis depend on the cause and severity of the infection. The prognosis also depends on the type of bacteria, antimicrobial resistance, and patient comorbidity. This is where the input of a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can be very beneficial, helping select appropriate antimicrobial coverage, check for drug interactions, and verify all dosing, and report any concerns to the clinical team. If left untreated, the condition has a very high mortality. Even those who survive have a prolonged recovery period. Residual disturbance in renal function is not uncommon.[21][22] [Level 5] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=30873&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=30873) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/kidney-health/urosepsis-urine-infection/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=30873) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/30873/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=30873) ## References 1.
