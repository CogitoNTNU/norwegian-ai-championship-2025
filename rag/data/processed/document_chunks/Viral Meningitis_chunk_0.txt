This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and diagnosis of meningitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Review the causes of meningitis. - Describe the presentation of a patient with meningitis. - Summarize the treatment of meningitis. - Describe modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by meningitis.

Despite breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination, in 2015, there were 8.7 million reported cases of meningitis worldwide, with 379,000 subsequent deaths.[1][2][3] Meningitis is a life-threatening disorder that is most often caused by bacteria or viruses. Before the era of antibiotics, the condition was universally fatal. Nevertheless, even with great innovations in healthcare, the condition still carries a mortality rate of close to 25%. ## Etiology Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges. The meninges are the three membranes (the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater) that line the vertebral canal and skull enclosing the brain and spinal cord. Encephalitis, on the other hand, is inflammation of the brain itself.[4][5] Meningitis can be caused by infectious and non-infectious processes (autoimmune disorders, cancer/paraneoplastic syndromes, drug reactions). The infectious etiologic agents of meningitis include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and less commonly parasites. Risk factors for meningitis include: - Chronic medical disorders (renal failure, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, cystic fibrosis) - Extremes of age - Undervaccination - Immunosuppressed states (iatrogenic, transplant recipients, congenital immunodeficiencies, AIDS) - Living in crowded conditions - Exposures: - Travel to endemic areas (Southwestern U.S. for cocci; Northeastern U.S. for Lyme disease) - Vectors (mosquitoes, ticks) - Alcohol use disorder - Presence of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt - Bacterial endocarditis
