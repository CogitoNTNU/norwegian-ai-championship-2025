an interprofessional team consisting of physicians, nurse practitioners, specialty care nurses, and pharmacists will improve outcomes. Pharmacists evaluate drug selection, doses, and interactions. Critical care and medical-surgical nurses administer treatments, monitor patients, and are crucial in the notification of the team as to changes in status. Infection control nurses often follow up to ensure the quality of care. [3][14][15][Level V] **Outcomes** Patients with bacteremia who are treated with antibiotics or observed have good outcomes. But rarely the bacteremia may cause endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, meningitis sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction, followed by death. Over the past four decades, the availability of better antibiotics and vaccination has resulted in lower mortality rates in people of all ages. Prior to the era of vaccination, the mortality rates from bacteremia were over 20%. Today, the biggest concern in the development of antibiotic resistance which is now common against most organisms. Many guidelines have been developed to manage children and seniors with fever and bacteremia, but the bottom line is that one should always be aware of the potential of harm if the observation is selected as a method of treatment.[16][17][18] [Level 5] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18093&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18093) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/bacteremia-bloodstream-bacteria/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=18093) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18093/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18093) ## References 1.
