retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of a 21-month regimen of hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg/day during the first month, 4 mg/kg/day during the second month, 3 mg/kg/day during the third month, 2 mg/kg/day for next 9 months, and slow taper during remaining of the treatment period) in 44 patients with a positive response in 34 patients during the first 3 months of the treatment, and with normalization of EEG in 21 patients. However, among 34 responders, 14 patients had a subsequent relapse. Higher intelligence and developmental quotients and shorter disease duration before initiating treatment were associated with a positive outcome. Due to side effects, 7 patients discontinued treatment early.[25] Chen et al reviewed the efficacy of a different regimen of corticosteroids that used a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone with oral prednisone for 6 months. This study has results reporting a high response rate but a high relapse rate at 1-year follow-up.[26] Due to fear of side effects from long-duration corticosteroid therapy, methylprednisolone pulse therapy (15 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days consecutively, once a month for 4 months) has also been used successfully.[27] A recent review calculated a response rate, defined as an improvement in the EEG or cognition, of 80% in response to steroid therapy in 575 patients compared to 49% with antiepileptic drugs and 68% from benzodiazepines.[28] The subgroup of patients with ESES and structural brain pathology, such as perinatal infarction or cortical malformation, may benefit from epilepsy surgery. Different surgical procedures (eg, multiple subpial transections, focal lesionectomies, and hemispherectomies) have mainly been used in patients with structural brain pathology. Children with unilateral brain pathology were frequently seizure-free after hemispherectomy or focal resection, with the disappearance of the EEG pattern and improvement in cognitive status.[29] However, more studies are needed to assess long-term neurocognitive status and determine the role of surgery. The ketogenic diet and intravenous immunoglobulin infusions have been studied in small numbers of patients, and no specific recommendations are possible regarding their efficacy. ## Differential Diagnosis Patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome develop less frequent seizures and severe regression of language development (auditory agnosia) rather than the more global regression noted with ESES.[30] The EEG pattern in Landau-Kleffner syndrome is typically unilateral or lateralized.[31] Children with benign pediatric focal epileptic syndromes—benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and late-onset childhood occipital epilepsy, Gastaut type—can present with relatively easy-to-control seizures and milder neuropsychological deficits. The EEG of these patients shows potentiation
