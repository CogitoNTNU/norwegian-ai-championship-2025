the bubble study: agitated saline, 3-way stop cock, 2 10 ml syringes, and an extension tube connector - Gel to lubricate transesophageal probe - Topic anesthetics such as lidocaine to numb the pharynx [8] **Equipment Requirement for Stress Echocardiography** - Echocardiography machine - Exercise stress test machine - Cardiac monitor to look for vitals - Medications (such as dobutamine and atropine) to give stress in patients who can not perform an exercise stress test and medications (such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) to reverse the effect of dobutamine and atropine ## Personnel Personnel required to perform and interpret an echocardiogram include: - Cardiologist - Echocardiogram technician ## Technique or Treatment For transthoracic echocardiography, the patient should lie in the left lateral position. ## Complications The complications from transthoracic echocardiography and stress echocardiography are infrequent. **Transesophageal Echocardiography** 1. Gastrointestinal bleeding 1. Esophageal perforation 1. Pharyngeal hematoma 1. Aspiration 1. Laryngospasm 1. Arrhythmia 1. Toxic methemoglobinemia [9][10] **Stress Echocardiography** 1. Myocardial infarction 1. Arrhythmia 1. Coronary spasm 1. Hypertension or hypotension secondary to medication [11][12] ## Clinical Significance **Transthoracic echocardiography** : a non-invasive, low-cost, widely available, first-line diagnostic test to evaluate cardiac disease and function. It not only helps to diagnose cardiac disease but also provides useful information to guide therapy. **Transesophageal echocardiography** : an invasive test in which transthoracic echo is inconclusive or needs further information on infectious endocarditis. The esophagus's proximity to the heart and absence of intervening structures such as the lung make the Transesophageal echo ideal for examining various important structures. **Stress echocardiography** : including imaging in routine stress testing increases the sensitivity and specificity of the test in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography post-myocardial infarction helps in risk stratification, location, and extent of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography can also be used to risk-stratify patients before non-cardiac surgery, as resting echo does not provide essential prognostic information. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes To perform echocardiography requires an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist and an echo technician. It is vital to take a proper history and perform a pre-procedure physical examination to determine the indication of the procedure. Communication between echo technicians and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in results. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=129469&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=129469) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/ultrasound-adult-echocardiography-assessment-protocols-and-interpretation-echocardiography/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=129469) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/129469/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=129469) [![Parasternal Long-Axis View on Transthoracic Echocardiography](/books/NBK570556/bin/PLAX__view.gif)](/books/NBK570556/figure/article-129469.image.f1/?report=objectonly
