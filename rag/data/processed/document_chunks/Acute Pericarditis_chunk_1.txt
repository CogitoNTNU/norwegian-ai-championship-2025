Pericardial inflammation often leads to fluid accumulation within the pericardial sac, forming a pericardial effusion, which can be serous, hemorrhagic, or purulent, depending on etiology. The fluid accumulation can become hemodynamically significant, especially if the effusion is large or accumulates rapidly, as the fluid may extrinsically compress the cardiac chambers, restrict diastolic filling, and lead to cardiac tamponade.[2][4] This condition can present with obstructive shock and is considered a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. Additionally, pericarditis may lead to pericardial thickening, which can rarely manifest as constrictive pericarditis months or even years after the initial insult. A recently described condition known as effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs when fluid accumulates around the heart. Yet constrictive physiology—such as respiratory-enhanced interventricular dependence, a restrictive E/A filling pattern, and mitral annulus reversus with septal e' velocity greater than lateral e'—persists even after pericardiocentesis. This indicates the presence of constrictive pathology that is independent of the pericardial effusion.[6][8] The aforementioned pericardial syndromes may occur alongside acute pericarditis but are not required for its diagnosis and will be discussed in more detail elsewhere. ## Etiology The 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for diagnosing and managing pericardial diseases categorize the causes of acute pericarditis into 2 main groups—infectious and noninfectious.[9] **Infectious Causes of Pericarditis** Viruses are the most common infectious agents causing pericarditis, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19, HIV, influenza, and several herpes viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).[9][10] Bacterial pericarditis occurs infrequently in in developed countries; however, tuberculosis remains widespread in developing regions and is the most common cause of pericarditis in endemic
