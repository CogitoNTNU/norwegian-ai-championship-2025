complications involved in sepsis and septic shock. This was not the case, as it was withdrawn from the market after further studies were published showing no benefit and potentially worse outcomes. Further efforts were made to look at the administration of monoclonal antibodies against TNF, blocking IL-1 activity, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), NO inhibitors, anti-thrombin, N-acetylcysteine, and using antibodies to endotoxin; however, these too failed to demonstrate efficacy. Despite these failures, further development of other immunomodulating agents and the proposed "metabolic cocktail" continue to be pursued, as mortality, even with newer therapies, remains unacceptably high.[19][37] ## Differential Diagnosis **Endocrine** - Adrenal insufficiency - Thyrotoxicosis **Toxidromes** - Salicylate toxicity - Anticholinergic toxicity - Malignant hyperthermia - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - Heat stroke **Severe Inflammatory States** - Major trauma - Pancreatitis - Anaphylaxis - Burns **Shock Types** - Cardiogenic shock - Distributive shock (i.e., sepsis) - Obstructive shock - Hypovolemic shock ## Prognosis Although morbidity and mortality from sepsis have declined in the last 2 decades considerably, there remains a large need for improvement in management. This decline in mortality associated with sepsis can be in part attributed to earlier recognition and intervention, as well as advances in the understanding of this disease process. Important markers for disease severity and prognostic implications, such as the SIRS or qSOFA criterion, have been able to provide some framework for treatment as well as insight into the prognosis for affected patients. Goal-directed therapies that have contributed to this decline in mortality are geared towards goals that have significant prognostic implications. For example, lactic acid accumulation in the setting of sepsis has been shown to be highly specific for predicting the acute phase of death and in-hospital mortality as it increases with levels greater than 4 mmol/L having a 28.4% likelihood of mortality. Although using lactate to guide therapy has not been shown to independently affect mortality in these patients, 2-hour lactate clearance has been shown to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.[15][16] With the implementation of bundle-based care, retrospective studies have also shown greater in-hospital mortality when compared to times to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and completion of a 3-hour bundle. This has some prognostic value attached to it, as completion of the intravenous fluid bolus was not shown to affect mortality.[27] Clinical scores such as the qSOFA and SIRS scores have been able to be applied in early settings, with worsening scores
