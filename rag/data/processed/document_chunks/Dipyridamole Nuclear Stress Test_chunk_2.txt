disease after mechanical cardiac valve replacement.[7] Additionally, a randomized control trial performed previously in 1983 compared using warfarin with either aspirin, dipyridamole, or alone to evaluate the risk of adverse bleeding events in those who underwent mechanical valve replacement. The study concluded that the use of dipyridamole in place of aspirin resulted in a 10% reduction of risk for adverse bleeding events when combined with warfarin.[8] **Role in Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (off label-use)** Myocardial perfusion imaging is a form of assessing blood flow to the heart and evaluating coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole was the first agent employed for pharmacologic stress testing but now also includes dobutamine and adenosine-induced testing.[1][3] The premise of pharmacologic stress testing is to induce coronary steal through the dilation of the normal coronary vessels, showing the signs of ischemia and hypoperfusion on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.[9] Dipyridamole is useful in this application as it promotes coronary arteriolar dilation through two predominant mechanisms, the hyperemic effect and the ischemic effect, which allows for the assessment of myocardial ischemia and thus assesses the risk of coronary artery disease.[9] Of note, a 2015 study tested the diagnostic value of a combined dipyridamole plus exercise stress testing protocol for those who could not attain a sufficient maximum predicted heart rate. The test found the sensitivity of this test to exceed sensitivities for diagnostic groups tested with exercise or dipyridamole alone; however, it failed to attain statistical significance given its small sample size.[10] ## Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole functions predominantly by inhibiting the function of phosphodiesterase and adenosine deaminase.[11] Phosphodiesterase is useful for the conversion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) to their non-cyclic equivalent.[11][12] The inhibition of this enzyme increases the intracellular concentration of secondary messenger molecules cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP).[12] The increased cAMP and cGMP inhibit platelet aggregation and platelet-related thrombosis reversibly.[13][14] This anti-platelet action allows for its indication for thromboembolism prophylaxis in mechanical valve replacement as an adjunct to anticoagulant and its use in secondary stroke prophylaxis.[14] Further, the accumulation of these secondary messengers, along with the downstream release of prostacyclin/PGD2, promotes vasodilatory effects on the coronary artery vasculature.[12] This vasodilatory effect induces coronary steal in a pharmacologic stress test to induce myocardial ischemia in vessels affected by coronary artery disease. ## Administration Dipyridamole is available in tablet forms of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg strengths.
