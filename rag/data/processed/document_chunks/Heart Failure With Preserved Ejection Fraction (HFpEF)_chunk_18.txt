angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, hydralazine and nitrates, digoxin, sinus node I-f channel blockers, and statins. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The management of HFpEF requires a collaborative effort among healthcare professionals, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists, and others, to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, ensure patient safety, and optimize team performance. Given that heart failure represents a common endpoint for various disease processes, including ischemic heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, addressing the underlying etiologies and risk factors is crucial. HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with predisposing conditions that involve increasing age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Additionally, HFpEF may result from multiple risk factors, including sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, iron deficiency, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dysrhythmias. The complexity of HFpEF necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, and the exact pathogenic role of each risk factor remains incompletely understood. Diagnosing HFpEF is challenging due to common clinical manifestations and the overlap with other heart failure subtypes. Diagnostic algorithms, such as HFA-PEFF and H2FPEF, along with additional testing like echocardiography and natriuretic peptide measurement, are employed to confirm the diagnosis. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure provides an evidence-based diagnostic approach. Therapeutic interventions for HFpEF focus on reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, preventing disease progression, and managing comorbidities. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise training, weight loss, and sodium restriction, are cornerstones of treatment. Antihypertensive therapies, including diuretics, ARNIs, ARBs, and MRAs, are recommended, with a blood pressure goal lower than 130/80 mm Hg. Beta-blockers, sacubitril-valsartan, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are shown to have beneficial effects. Consultation with sleep medicine is recommended in patients with HFpEF and suspected sleep apnea. For acute decompensation of HFpEF, a multidisciplinary shock team assessment involving intravenous vasopressors, appropriate ventilation support, and diuresis is crucial. Renal replacement therapy may be considered in patients with poor renal function. However, the early initiation of certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and beta-blockers, lacks substantial evidence for preventing major adverse cardiac events in unstable acute decompensated HFpEF. The 2022 ACC/AHA Guideline emphasizes palliative and supportive care for all patients with heart failure, including those with HFpEF. Primary palliative care should begin early and address high-quality communication, advance care planning, home and case management assistance, and other needs. The complexity of HFpEF necessitates ongoing research and a comprehensive, team-based
