pulmonary embolism: Endovascular interventions are generally contraindicated due to low morbidity and mortality. The exception might be large saddle emboli without hemodynamic or right ventricular issues. Ongoing trials on optimal dosing and duration are underway.[16] 1. Major adverse bleeding risk: Balancing potential CDT benefits with individual bleeding risks is crucial. Comorbidities and bleeding history require careful evaluation. 1. Patient-specific considerations: Shared decision-making, incorporating patient values, preferences, and goals, is paramount. It ensures that treatment aligns with individual circumstances and desires. ## Contraindications Though thrombolysis is administered locally during CDT, there is a risk of systemic effects associated with thrombolysis therapy. Systemic thrombolytic therapy is implicated in many severe CDT complications, such as severe bleeding. Hence, practitioners must thoroughly review the patient's medical history before considering thrombolytic therapy (see **Table.** Contraindication for Thrombolytic Therapy).

Contraindication for Thrombolytic Therapy. ## Equipment Systemic thrombolysis, the traditional approach for treating acute pulmonary embolism, has limitations. The risk of major bleeding, particularly in high-risk patients, can be significant. Additionally, systemic delivery may not adequately reach and break down the clot, potentially limiting its effectiveness. CDT emerges as a promising alternative. This targeted approach delivers clot-busting medication (thrombolytics) directly to the pulmonary embolism through a catheter, potentially enhancing efficacy while reducing bleeding risk compared to systemic administration. However, the optimal CDT approach remains nuanced, varying based on individual characteristics and pulmonary embolism severity. **Evidence Landscape** While the evidence base for CDT is evolving, it shows promise. Ongoing clinical trials like Pulmonary Embolism-Thrombus Removal with Catheter-Directed Therapy (PE-TRACT) and Higher Risk Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (HI-PEITHO) are investigating its effectiveness in specific patient populations. However, further research is needed to solidify its role and define optimal treatment strategies.

AC = Anticoagulation, tPA = Tissue plasminogen activator, USAT = Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis **CDT in Practice** Several CDT devices are available, each with unique mechanisms. Two such mechanisms are the established EKOS Intelligent Drug Delivery System (IDDC) and the recently approved Bashir Endovascular Catheter (BEC-CDT), each equipped with distinctive instruments to combat pulmonary embolism clots. **EKOS-CDT** - Central conductor: The EKOS-IDDC serves as the central conduit for intervention. This multi-lumen catheter allows simultaneous delivery of a thrombolytic agent (eg, rt-PA) and saline coolant directly to the target thrombus. - Sonic disruption module: The MicroSonic Device (MSD) nested within the IDDC harbors multiple
