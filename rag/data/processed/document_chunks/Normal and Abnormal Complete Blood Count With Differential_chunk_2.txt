the average volume of the red blood cells present and is expressed in femtoliter (fL) or cubic micrometers (µm3). The value is calculated by dividing Hct by RBC. The normal reference interval in adults is 80 to 100 µm3. MCV is commonly used to classify anemias as microcytic (low MCV), normocytic (normal MCV), or macrocytic (high MCV). Different etiologies are often associated with characteristic red cell morphologies (see **Table.** 2).[10][11][12] MCV is a mean measure of RBC size, and variations in cell size may be considered normal during anisocytosis. Hence, assessing anemia necessitates the utilization of RBC indices and peripheral smear examination rather than depending on a single parameter. MCV may be spuriously elevated in the setting of: - Red cell agglutination, where doublet erythrocytes are automatically counted as one - Hyperglycemia occurs when an excess of glucose causes hypertonic erythrocytes to swell, increasing RBC volume within the counting medium. - Hypernatremia is due to the swelling of hypertonic erythrocytes. - Hyperleucocytosis, where the larger white cells are counted as red cells when calculating mean cell volume.[4][13] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table1/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK604207/table/article-161108.table1/?report=objectonly) Table 2. Classification of Anemia by MCV and RDW. . **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin** Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) quantifies the amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell and is expressed as picograms per cell (pg/cell). The value is calculated by dividing hemoglobin by red cell count. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 27 to 32 pg/RBC. MCH is dependent on cell volume and correlates closely with MCV. Conversely, the CBC also includes the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which controls for cell volume and is useful in evaluating anemia. **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrate** MCHC is the mean hemoglobin concentration per unit volume of red blood cells, expressed as a gram per deciliter (g/dl) or percentage of Hb per cell. The value is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit. While MCH quantifies the amount of hemoglobin, MCHC indicates the hemoglobin density in each red cell, controlling for MCV. Red blood cell quantity of Hb is regulated and is normally limited to an optimal density of approximately 34% Hb/cell. Hypochromia refers to a low MCHC, while normochromic describes a normal MCHC. Hypochromic anemia may be due to decreased Hb production, the most common cause being iron deficiency (less commonly copper deficiency, pyridoxine deficiency, or lead poisoning), or due to reticulocytosis, as reticulocytes have a lower concentration of
