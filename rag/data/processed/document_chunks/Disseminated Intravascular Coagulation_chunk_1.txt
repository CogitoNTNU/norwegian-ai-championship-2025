rate of DIC remains difficult as patients with this condition also have additional diagnoses that can cause many of the signs and symptoms consistent with DIC, particularly if they also have acute or chronic liver failure. While concomitant disease states can obscure a patientâ€™s prognosis, mortality rates have been shown to double in patients who are septic or those with severe trauma if they also have DIC.[1][2][3][4][5] ## Etiology Multiple medical conditions can lead to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation through a systemic inflammatory response or the release of procoagulants into the bloodstream. The pathological process of DIC has been estimated to occur in up to 30% to 50% of cases of severe sepsis, which is the most common cause of DIC. Classically, DIC has been associated with gram-negative bacteria sepsis, though the prevalence of this disorder in sepsis due to gram-positive organisms may be similar. Other causes of sepsis, including parasites, can also lead to DIC. Up to 20% of patients with metastasized adenocarcinoma or lymphoproliferative disease also have DIC, in addition to 1% to 5% percent of patients with chronic diseases like solid tumors and aortic aneurysms. Obstetrical complications such as placental abruption, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (eg, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome), and amniotic fluid embolism have also been known to lead to DIC. Other causes of DIC include trauma, pancreatitis, malignancy, snake bites, liver disease, transplant rejection, and transfusion reactions. About 15.5% of cases of DIC have also been linked to complications occurring after surgery.[6][7][8][9][10][11] ## Epidemiology Because DIC is a complication of other medical diagnoses, the prevalence of DIC remains greater in higher acuity settings as opposed to lower acuity settings. Almost invariably, a severe or life-threatening diagnosis is associated with the disease. A 1996 study in Japan found that a diagnosis of DIC complicated about 1.0% percent of admissions to university hospitals. Similarly, a 1992 study showed that DIC complicated 12% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia before starting chemotherapy, and DIC was detected in 78% of cases during remission induction. Furthermore, HELLP syndrome was associated with DIC in approximately 1 in 5 cases, according to a 1993 study.

Tissue factor, which may be released into the circulation from vascular endothelial damage from trauma or certain cancer treatments,
