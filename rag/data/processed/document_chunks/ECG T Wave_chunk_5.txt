For example, dig immune Fab is the first-line agent for digoxin toxicity. It is an immunoglobulin fragment that binds with digoxin and neutralizes it.[10] ## Differential Diagnosis **The differential diagnoses for ECG T waves include the following:** **T-wave Inversion** - Normal variant - Myocardial ischemia - Ventricular strain - Cerebrovascular injury - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Idiopathic - Left bundle branch block - Right bundle branch block - Ventricular beats **Peaked T-waves** - The hyperacute phase of myocardial infarction - Prinzmetal angina - Normal variant - Hyperkalemia - Left ventricular hypertrophy - Left bundle branch block - Acute pericarditis[4] ## Prognosis The prognosis depends mainly on the underlying etiology. T-wave abnormalities seen on the EKG may be benign or represent severe, life-threatening conditions. The ECG and a thorough history and physical provide valuable information about the patient's etiology and prognosis. ## Complications The worst complication of T-wave abnormalities is a misdiagnosis of serious T-wave pathology or delay in treatment intervention. Other possible complications include cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia or infarction, arrhythmia, tamponade, heart failure, and even death. ## Consultations Consultations with interventional cardiology would be appropriate in the setting of suspected myocardial infarction. It is recommended that a consult is placed to nephrology in the context of chronic kidney disease or severe hyperkalemia. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients must be educated on the signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease and instructed to seek medical attention when these arise. The American Heart Association, along with the American College of Cardiology, are avid proponents of heart disease awareness. Millions of dollars go toward educating the public every year on this topic.[16] However, it is essential that all healthcare providers regularly educate our patients on possible heart disease presentations so our patients can seek rapid, appropriate help. According to the 2018 USRDS report, kidney disease is rising in the United States of America.[17] Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of electrolyte abnormalities and may lead to T-wave changes. It is vital to educate our patients on appropriate risk factor modification through tight diabetes and blood pressure control. Primary prevention of kidney disease is essential. Those with previously developed kidney disease should be monitored closely for electrolyte abnormalities. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes When working in an emergent situation, communication between providers on all levels of training must be in sync.[14] Evidence supports the maximization of interprofessional communication, and care coordination optimizes healthcare
