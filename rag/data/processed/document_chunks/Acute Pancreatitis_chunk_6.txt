with acute pancreatitis experience abdominal pain at some point during the disease. Some of the current practice guidelines overlook the recommendation for pain management. In contrast, others provide strong recommendations for pain assessment and best pharmacological therapy but fail to provide sufficient details regarding the analgesia's type, dose, route, and frequency.[22][23][24] Treatment of acute pancreatitis may seem to be an easy task in the clinical routine. The World Health Organization(WHO) analgesic ladder is initially employed in pain management. It includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and highly potent opioid analgesics in an escalating manner, along with interventional strategies. Among the analgesics, many choices are available, such as opioids fentanyl and meperidine, and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Pain management is based on the WHO analgesic ladder, which consists of 4 steps outlined in the following table: [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK482468/table/article-26578.table2/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK482468/table/article-26578.table2/?report=objectonly) It was considered in the past that Opioids could trigger the spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Still, a recent Cochrane review of 5 RCTs with a total of 227 patients shows no difference between opioids and other analgesic options regarding the risk of complications or clinically severe adverse events.[26] Also, a meta-analysis by Stigliano et al concluded there was no credible evidence to avoid using morphine for pain management in acute pancreatitis.[27] Further management is directed at the etiology of pancreatitis. In gallstone pancreatitis, there is a strong recommendation for early cholecystectomy. Early ERCP is beneficial in cases of concurrent cholangitis and blatant biliary obstruction within 24 hours of presentation. ERCP is reserved for a distal biliary filling defect on intraoperative cholangiogram during cholecystectomy in mild or spontaneously resolving biliary pancreatitis cases. In hypertriglyceridemia, specific treatment aims to reduce triglyceride levels to less than 500 mg/dL. This goal is achieved by apheresis and insulin drip with or without glucose. Local complications of acute pancreatitis include early (less than 4 weeks, peripancreatic fluid collection, and pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis) and late (more than 4 weeks, pancreatic pseudocyst, and walled-off necrosis). Usually, acute peripancreatic fluid collection resolves spontaneously in most cases, and only less than 10% results in pancreatic pseudocyst. Most pseudocysts decide to do observation alone with periodic follow-up using CT or MRI (see **Image.** Necrotising Pancreatitis With Extensive Peripancreatic Nodularity). Drainage of these pseudocysts is only recommended in case of infection and rapid enlargement. The drainage modalities include endoscopic (transmural or transpupillary) or percutaneous, the endoscopic approach being the preferred modality.
