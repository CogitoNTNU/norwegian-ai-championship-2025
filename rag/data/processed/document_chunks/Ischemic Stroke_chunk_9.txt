vary depending on the location and the infarction pattern of embolism or atherosclerosis. [28][29] **Cerebellar Infarction** Patients may present with ataxia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dysarthria, and vertigo symptoms. In addition, edema and rapid clinical deterioration can complicate cerebellar infarction.[28] **Lacunar Infarction** Lacunar infarcts result from the occlusion of small perforating or penetrating arteries. By definition, these infarcts are smaller than 1 centimeter in diameter. Lacunar infarction can present with a pure motor or sensory loss, sensorimotor deficit, or ataxic-hemiparesis.[30][31][32] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Lacunar Stroke](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/113551)," for more information. ## History and Physical Ischemic strokes manifest suddenly, making it crucial to determine the time when symptoms first appeared. If the exact moment of symptom onset is unknown, clinicians use the time the patient was last observed in their usual state of health, free from new neurological symptoms, as a reference point. This established timeline is critical for deciding the appropriateness of administering intravenous (IV) thrombolytics. Another vital aspect of the clinical assessment involves investigating potential underlying causes to anticipate the stroke's mechanism. Factors to consider include common vascular risk factors such as hypertension, a history of stroke or TIAs, smoking, and diabetes. Additionally, a history of cardiac diseases, notably atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy, should be ascertained by the treating clinician. Factors like a history of neck injury, recent chiropractic manipulations, and signs of hypercoagulopathy also play a significant role in the evaluation.[33] A neurological examination is crucial for all patients suspected of having a stroke. Monitoring vital signs and heart rhythms is essential, as is listening for a neck bruit, which can indicate vascular abnormalities. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [[See NIH Stroke Scale]](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/know-stroke/health-professionals/nih-stroke-scale) is the standard tool for assessing stroke severity, featuring 11 categories and scores ranging from 0 to 42.[34][35] These categories include the level of consciousness (LOC) instructions, LOC questions, LOC commands, gaze direction, vision, facial symmetry, arm and leg motor skills, limb coordination, sensory perception, language abilities, speech clarity, and attention to both sides of the body (see **Table 1.** National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). The stroke scale should be performed in a specified order, basing each score on the patient's performance during the examination rather than on predicted abilities.
