NORSE, an etiology remains unknown despite an extensive workup. However, autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis remains the most common identifiable etiology in NORSE.[11][45] Therefore, a detailed history and clinical examination should be sought as certain clinical features can point towards a specific underlying etiology leading to early immunotherapy during the acute phase, ultimately influencing outcomes and disability. - Anti-NMDA encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis and should be ruled out early. It usually starts as a febrile illness in young adults, common in females.[46] This is soon followed by psychiatric disturbances like hallucinations (behavioral changes in children), sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, memory complaints, epileptic seizures, oro-lingual dyskinesias, and autonomic failure.[47] As compared to anti-NMDA encephalitis, patients with cryptogenic NORSE are more frequently associated with early onset of SE, prolonged disease course, absence of behavioral symptoms, ventilator dependence, and worse outcomes.[22] - Encephalitis with anti-VGKC complex antibodies (LGI1 or, more rarely, Caspr2) can present with limbic encephalitis (cognitive impairment, confusion, behavioral disturbances, sleep disturbances, and seizures) and abnormalities in serum sodium levels associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.[48] Facio-brachial dystonic seizures can occur in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis and is a pathognomonic feature of the disease.[49] - Amongst infectious causes, patients should be screened for uncommon infections as early as possible. HSV-1 infection can present with an acute illness consisting of fever, alteration in mentation, behavioral changes, multiple seizures (though uncommon to progress to RSE), focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, ataxia, aphasia), without or without dermatomal rashes. Whereas lower motor neuron type weakness with rash and prodromal febrile illness can suggest an underlying enterovirus related infection.[11][13] - Systemic reversible causes like toxic-metabolic disturbances (heavy metals including lead, aluminum arsenic, mercury) and drug toxicity should be considered in the differential and evaluated appropriately. ## Prognosis NORSE (and FIRES in children) is an uncommon neurological condition associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. Most patients remain unresponsive to multiple anesthetic agents and evolve into SRSE. A 12% mortality rate has been seen in children and 16% to 27% in adults.[11][14][50][51] Most of the survivors eventually develop multidrug-resistant epilepsy on long-term follow-up and significant cognitive and functional impairment. Prolonged ICU stay, medical complications, duration of barbiturate induced coma, and use of multiple anesthetic agents have been associated with worse outcomes both in children and adults.[11][13][14][25][52] ## Complications Patients with NORSE often require multiple IV anesthetic agents for prolonged periods to achieve burst suppression coma.
