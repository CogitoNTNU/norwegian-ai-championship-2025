structure; the competence of the mitral valve depends on the correct interaction of different components of the mitral valve apparatus.[2][18][19] The anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve should "coapt" to prevent MR during systole. An alteration in the functioning of any mitral valve component can lead to the development of MR.[20] The 2 types of MR are primary and secondary. Primary MR is a degenerative valve disease, while secondary MR is characteristically a functional myocardial disease, ie, ventricular remodeling (see **Table 1.** Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation).

Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation. Primary and secondary MR are further classified into stages A through D (see **Table 2.** Stages of Primary Mitral Regurgitation and **Table 3.** Stages of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation), indicating whether they are mild, moderate, or severe. Several interventions exist to treat severe MR, including surgical and nonsurgical. Patients with severe MR and who are at high or are a prohibitive risk for surgery are currently the only subset of patients recommended for catheter management. If untreated, severe MR can lead to fatal sequelae, including heart failure.[21] [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table1/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table1/?report=objectonly) Table 2. Stages of Primary Mitral Regurgitation. Several valve hemodynamic criteria are provided for assessing MR, but not all criteria for each category will be present in each patient. Categorization of MR severity as mild, moderate, or severe depends on data quality and integration of these parameters in conjunction with other clinical evidence.[3] **Table 3.** Stages of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table2/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table2/?report=objectonly) Normal mitral valve leaflets, chords, and annulus in a patient with coronary disease or cardiomyopathy No MR jet or small central jet area \<20% left atrium on Doppler Several valve hemodynamic criteria are provided for assessing MR severity, but not all criteria for each category will be present in each patient. Categorization of MR severity as mild, moderate, or severe depends on data quality and integration of these parameters in conjunction with other clinical evidence. The measurement of the proximal iso velocity surface area by 2D TTE in patients with secondary MR underestimates the true ERO because of the crescentic shape of the proximal convergence.[3] Echocardiography is the primary tool used to assess the structure and function of the MV, systolic competence, and nonrestriction during diastole. Various types of mitral valve leaflet motion can indicate the underlying reason for the dysfunction (see **Table 4.** Mitral
