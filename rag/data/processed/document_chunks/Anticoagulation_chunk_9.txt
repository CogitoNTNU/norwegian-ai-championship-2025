to baseline.[30][32][22] **Duration of Anticoagulation Therapy** Treatment duration with anticoagulation should be individualized based on recurrence and risk of bleeding.[33][34] - When the first episode of venous thromboembolism (provoked or unprovoked), treatment for a minimum of 3 months. - Persisting or reversible risk factor, treatment may be extended to 6 or 12 months. - If unprovoked proximal DVT and symptomatic PE, indefinite anticoagulation for life. - When recurrent venous thromboembolism with or without anticoagulation, indefinite anticoagulation for life. ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions - Educate at-risk patients on the disease condition and precautionary measures to minimize bleeding risk like avoiding suppositories, careful tooth brushing. - Encourage ambulation and activities to keep patients in chairs and out of bed for hospitalized patients or use mechanical compression devices if no contraindication. - Skin and mucosal inspection for petechiae, purpura, and open wounds. ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring Encourage close monitoring of patients on anticoagulation suspected of bleeding. This includes: - Monitoring hemoglobin serially - Monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, and electrocardiogram - Administering blood products if indicated - Monitor for indicators of internal bleeding like back, joint, or flank pain - Monitor for dark or smoky colored urine - Minimize unnecessary intravenous line placement or venipuncture ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17685&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17685) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/therapeutics/anticoagulation-anticoagulation-therapy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17685) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17685/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17685) ## References 1.
