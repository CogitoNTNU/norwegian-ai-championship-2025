antiplatelet therapy combining aspirin with a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, such as prasugrel or ticagrelor, is the recommended strategy for most individuals with ACS.[38] Clopidogrel, which has less potent and more variable effects on platelet inhibition, should be reserved for cases where prasugrel and ticagrelor are contraindicated or unavailable or in patients with a high bleeding risk, defined as those meeting 1 major or 2 minor Antithrombotic Treatment for High Bleeding Risk criteria.[39] Clopidogrel may also be considered in patients aged 70 or older.[40] P2Y-inhibiting antiplatelet medication choice depends on whether the patient underwent PCI or fibrinolytic therapy. Due to results from recent trials showing superiority, ticagrelor and prasugrel are preferred over clopidogrel in patients who undergo PCI.[41] Individuals undergoing fibrinolytic therapy should be started on clopidogrel.[42] The relative contraindications of P2Y12 inhibitors should always be considered. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack and stroke. Anticoagulation should also be started alongside unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux.[43] Lipid-lowering therapy must be initiated as soon as possible following an ACS event, as the treatment is crucial for improving long-term prognosis and enhancing patient adherence after discharge. High-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, should be started early, ideally before any planned PCI, and prescribed at the highest tolerated dose to achieve target low-density lipoprotein-C levels.[44] Recent studies support β-blocker benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after ACS. However, the evidence for using these drugs in patients with LVEF greater than 40% following uncomplicated ACS is less definitive.[45] Except for the results from the CAPRICORN trial (CArvedilol Post-infaRct survIval COntRolled evaluatioN), which focused on patients with LVEF less than or equal to 40%, most large randomized controlled trials evaluating postmyocardial infarction β-blocker therapy were conducted before the widespread use of reperfusion therapies.[46] Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve postmyocardial infarction outcomes in patients with conditions such as heart failure, LVEF less than or equal to 40%, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension.[47] Historical trials of ACE inhibitors in STEMI have indicated a modest but significant reduction in 30-day mortality, particularly in cases of anterior myocardial infarction.[48] Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycemic control and reduce weight and blood pressure by inducing glycosuria and lowering plasma glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia.[49] In patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, trials of empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin
