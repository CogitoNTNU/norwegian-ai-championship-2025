angina, the increased demand only occurs with exertion, but in unstable angina, it also happens at rest. Increased myocardial oxygen demand from exercise is most notably due to increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and increased myocardial contractility, among other factors.[2] Under normal cardiac physiologic conditions, increased oxygen demand occurring with exertion is followed by coronary vasodilation, but in cases of coronary artery atherosclerosis, this function is impeded, and ischemia and chest pain ensue.[1] Vasospastic angina, otherwise known as variant angina or Prinzmetal angina, like stable angina, also occurs at rest but is unrelated to coronary atherosclerosis.[3] ## Epidemiology Chronic stable angina affects approximately 30000 to 40000 people per million people in Western countries.[2] Prevalence increases with age in both men and women. The estimates are prevalence for men and women 45 to 64 years old are 4 to 7% and 5 to 7%, respectively. In men and women 65 to 84 years old, the estimated prevalence is 14 to 15% and 10 to 12%, respectively.[2] Modifiable risk factors for angina include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, current or past tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and obesity/metabolic syndrome. Increasing BMI is an independent risk factor for coronary arterial disease (CAD).[4] Non-modifiable risk factors include increasing age, male sex, family history of CAD, and ethnic origin.[5] ## Pathophysiology The heart is dependent on an adequate oxygen supply for energy production to support contractility. At the cellular level, ischemia causes an increase in anaerobic glycolysis. This increases the levels of hydrogen, potassium, and lactate in the venous return of the ischemic or affected area of the myocardium. The hydrogen ions compete with calcium ions causing hypokinesia/akinesia of the affected area. For stable angina, this change in oxygen supply requires a trigger that would cause metabolic mismatchâ€” exercise, stress, and low temperature.[1] ## History and Physical Patients with ACS most commonly present with angina, which patients usually describe as pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness in the chest, with potential radiation to the jaw or left arm. It may be accompanied by shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, or any combination of the above. The chest pain may be precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest and/or nitroglycerin in the case of stable angina. In cases of unstable angina or myocardial infarction (MI) [non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI)/ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI)], the chest pain will likely not fully resolve with rest or nitroglycerin. In the case of stable angina,
