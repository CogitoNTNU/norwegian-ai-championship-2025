Patients may observe abrupt awakenings accompanied by shortness of breath, insomnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness, along with difficulty concentrating and mood changes. Central sleep apnea is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which there is abnormal breathing due to upper airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea can result from heart failure, stroke, high altitude. This activity reviews pathophysiology and diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available for managing central sleep apnea and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing the condition better. **Objectives:** - Describe the pathophysiology of central sleep apnea. - Summarize the typical presentation with central sleep apnea. - Identify the most common comorbidity associated with central sleep apnea and prognosis. - Explain different treatment modalities available for patients with central sleep apnea.

In general, CSA represents an array of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) conditions due to the brief absence of ventilatory output during sleep. CSA manifests as a cyclical phenomenon/pattern during sleep; periods of apnea or hypopnea alternating with hyperpnea. Although there is a lack of effort during central events, it has been found that the upper airway narrows or nearly collapses during these events. Upper airway narrowing consistently occurs at the retropalatal level during induced hypocapnic central apnea (video 1) and induced central hypopnea.[1] Though the prevalence of CSA is lower than OSA, both conditions often coexist, and patients can exhibit features of both states. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders â€“ Third Edition (ICSD-3) [2] has divided CSA syndromes into several categories based on distinct clinical and polysomnographic features; 1. Primary CSA 1. CSA with Cheyne-Stokes Breathing (CSB) 1. CSA due to a medical disorder without CSB 1. CSA due to a periodic high-altitude breathing 1. CSA due to a medication or substance 1. Treatment-emergent CSA Both hypoventilation and hyperventilation can result
