may have cold and clammy skin, altered mental status, and signs of peripheral vasoconstriction. ## Prognosis The in-hospital mortality rates associated with each classification are as follows:[27] - Killip class I: 6% - Killip class II: 17% - Killip class III: 38% - Killip class IV: 81% The anatomical location of occlusion of the LAD artery also predicts the 30-day and 1-year mortality in anterior myocardial infarction.

Cardiogenic shock complicating anterior MI is associated with higher hospital mortality when compared with inferior MI.[33] - **Left ventricular dysfunction:** AWMI involves a significant portion of the left ventricle, which can lead to impaired left ventricular function. This can result in decreased EF, compromised cardiac output, and an increased risk of heart failure. - **Left ventricular mural thrombus** is a frequent complication with systolic dysfunction due to anterior MI.[34][35] TTE can be used with high accuracy for diagnosis when suspicious of a thrombus.[36] This condition can lead to stroke or peripheral ischemia. - **Ventricular septal rupture** in the ventricular spetum results in communication between the left and right ventricles. This condition requires urgent surgical intervention. - **Free wall rupture** is rare but can lead to cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability. Emergency surgical repair is required. - **Pericardial effusion:** Due to free wall rupture, causing an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. This requires pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage. - **Acute pericarditis:** AWMI can cause inflammation of the pericardium. - **Dressler syndrome:** Delayed autoimmune response following MI, characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and fever. It typically occurs weeks to months after the initial event. - **Sudden cardiac death:** AWMI increases the
