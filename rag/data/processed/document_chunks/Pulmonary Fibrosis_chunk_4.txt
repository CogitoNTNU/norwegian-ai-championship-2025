proportion of heavy smokers in the emphysema group.[9][21] The prevalence of CAD in patients with IPF is estimated at 4% to 25%, and patients with IPF have a 3-fold increased risk of acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without IPF.[18] Patients with IPF have a significantly higher risk of venous thromboembolism compared to those without the condition. Longitudinal analysis indicates that the risk of venous thromboembolism in IPF patients is 3- to 6-fold higher than in individuals without IPF.[18][22] Notably, malignancy, particularly lung cancer, is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism, and patients with IPF face a 5-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer.[9][18] Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common comorbidity in patients with IPF. Although many individuals may have clinically silent GERD, estimates suggest that 30% to 50% of those with IPF also experience this condition. In addition, it is hypothesized that GERD contributes to the pathology of IPF through chronic microaspiration. Trials have been conducted to explore the use of GERD therapy in slowing the progression of IPF, but the results are inconclusive.[18][23][24] Additionally, hiatal hernia is common in IPF patients, and surgical intervention for this condition has shown success in individuals awaiting lung transplants.[23][25] Osteoporosis is common in patients with IPF, even in the absence of steroid use, and is closely associated with FVC and DLCO.[9] Low levels of Vitamin D are likely contributing factors to this phenomenon. Hypothyroidism is also more common in patients with IPF than in the general population, possibly related to increased underlying autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that this comorbidity serves as a poor prognostic indicator, underscoring the importance of screening all IPF patients for this highly treatable condition.[9][18][26] Moreover, the association between low thyroid hormones and pulmonary fibrosis may carry therapeutic implications. Anxiety and depression are common among patients with IPF. Anxiety levels often correlate with the degree of hypoxia experienced by the patient, while depression may be associated with the duration of diagnosis and overall quality of life.[9][18] ## Histopathology Histopathological confirmation for IPF may not always be necessary, but it should be considered if there are confounding factors, including cases where imaging shows an atypical UIP pattern (described below) or when there is suspicion of connective tissue disease. Bronchoscopic biopsy yields are typically low as the pathologic changes start subpleurally, and it is primarily useful for excluding other processes. Although bronchoscopic cryo-biopsies have been used more recently for pathologic
