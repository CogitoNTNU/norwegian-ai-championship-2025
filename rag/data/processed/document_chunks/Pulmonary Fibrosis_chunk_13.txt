associated with IPF include pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolic disease, adverse effects of medications, superimposed lung infections, acute coronary syndrome, and hypoxic respiratory failure. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Currently, specific recommendations for screening or deterrence of F are not available. However, patients diagnosed with IPF should adhere to the following measures:[5][71][72] - They should maintain a healthy weight and engage in exercise regularly. Pulmonary rehabilitation can be utilized for formal exercise training. - They should cease smoking, if applicable. - They should avoid environmental or occupational exposure that could exacerbate lung disease. - They should manage acid reflux as needed. - They should follow up for disease-specific therapies and consider referrals for lung transplants. - They should ensure vaccinations for influenza, pneumococcus, and COVID-19, as individuals with IPF have reduced lung reserve to tolerate respiratory infections. ## Pearls and Other Issues Navigating the complexities of IPF, a disease with potentially life-limiting symptoms, requires early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach. - Interdisciplinary management often involves collaboration among various specialists, including pulmonologists, chest radiologists, thoracic surgeons, rheumatologists, and pathologists. - Patients with IPF benefit from referral to an ILD specialty clinic for discussions regarding antifibrotic drug therapies and timely consideration for lung transplant. - Given the increased risk of CAD and acute coronary syndrome in these patients, cardiac calcification scores or other risk stratification measures should be considered as part of their comprehensive care. - All patients should undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea, GERD, and hypothyroidism, with appropriate treatment initiated as necessary. - Given the progressive nature of lung disease, it is imperative to address advanced care plans and end-of-life issues proactively. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Patients diagnosed with IPF face a high risk of disease progression. Thus, it is crucial to promptly identify and manage IPF to mitigate morbidity and mortality. Providing optimal care for individuals with IPF requires a collaborative approach among healthcare professionals to deliver patient-centered care and enhance overall outcomes. Primary care providers, pulmonologists, ILD experts, emergency medicine physicians, critical care physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, and other health professionals involved in the care of these patients should possess the essential clinical skills and knowledge to diagnose and manage IPF accurately. This includes expertise in recognizing the varied clinical presentations and understanding the intricacies of diagnostic techniques such as HRCT scans and, if necessary, lung biopsies.
