more indicative of miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. A decreasing serum β-hCG level is more suggestive of a spontaneous early pregnancy loss.[1][6] The discriminatory β-hCG level, the threshold above which an IUP should be visible on TVUS, varies based on equipment, sonographer expertise, and gestational number. Historically set between 1000 and 2000 mIU/mL, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has suggested using a cutoff of up to 3500 mIU/mL to prevent misdiagnosis and avoid unnecessary termination of a viable pregnancy.[1][6] Stable patients with a decreasing serum β-hCG in whom a possible ectopic pregnancy has not been excluded should continue to be monitored with serial β-hCG levels until undetectable.[1][6] TVUS is the gold standard for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy, with definitive confirmation when a yolk sac or embryo is visualized outside the uterus (see **Image**. Ectopic Pregnancy, Ultrasound). However, many cases may not continue to develop to this point, necessitating additional diagnostic approaches, including serial β-hCG monitoring, repeat ultrasonography, and uterine aspiration. In cases where neither an IUP nor an ectopic pregnancy is identified, the pregnancy is categorized as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). In such cases, serial β-hCG monitoring and, in some instances, manual vacuum aspiration can help differentiate between a failing IUP and an ectopic pregnancy.[1][6] Serial assessments using transvaginal imaging, serum hCG level measurements, or a combination of both are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The first sign of an IUP visible on ultrasound is a small sac located eccentrically within the decidua. Often, tissue rings form around the sac, leading to its designation as the “double decidual” sign.[13] This double decidual sign typically becomes visible during the fifth week of pregnancy, as seen in abdominal ultrasound imaging. The yolk sac appears around this time but requires transvaginal ultrasound imaging for accurate identification. An embryonic pole can be seen on transvaginal imaging at approximately 6 weeks of pregnancy.[13] Uterine fibroids or a high body mass index may hinder the accuracy of ultrasound imaging in detecting an early intrauterine pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in extreme cases, eg, with large obstructing uterine fibroids; however, its sensitivity and specificity require further investigation, and the potential risks associated with gadolinium contrast exposure should be carefully considered.[13] **Diagnostic Findings of Non-Fallopian Tube Pregnancies** Cervical pregnancies, once typically diagnosed in the second trimester or at the time of spontaneous abortion, can now be detected earlier through TVUS.
