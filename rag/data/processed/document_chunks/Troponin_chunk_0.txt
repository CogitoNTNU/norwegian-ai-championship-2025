The broad differential diagnosis of chest pain must be narrowed down quickly and accurately to perform the life-saving treatments patients require.[1] Along with the history and physical examination, several important diagnostic tools are used to differentiate the different causes of chest pain.[2] One tool that has become an essential component of cardiac workups and diagnosis is the measurement of troponins.[3] Cardiac troponins have been available for clinical use since 1995, when the first cardiac troponin T (cTnT) assay was approved.[4] Since then, it has become clear that enhanced cardiac specificity and particularly improved sensitivity lead to more frequent and more accurate diagnoses of cardiovascular abnormalities, especially with the implementation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins assays.[5] ## Etiology and Epidemiology Troponin exists in three distinct molecular forms, corresponding to specific isotypes found in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and heart tissue.[6] The skeletal isotypes are similar in molecular size, approximately 20,000 Daltons, and exhibit amino acid sequence heterogeneity of approximately 40%.[7] The cardiac isotype also exhibits about 40% sequence heterogeneity with respect to the skeletal isotypes and has an additional 31 residues at the amino terminus. Thus it is possible to immunologically distinguish cardiac troponin from skeletal troponin.[8] In the myocyte, troponins are found as structural (bound) proteins and as a small free pool that exists in the cytosol, which is about 6% to 8% for cTnT and 3.5% for cTnI.[9] cTnT differs in amino acid sequence from cTnI and can be distinguished immunologically.[10] Immunoassays have been developed which recognize cardiac forms of both troponins and react with complexed ternary and binary forms (cTnICT and cTnIC) and cytosolic cTnI or cTnT but do not cross-react with skeletal forms.[11] Before troponin, several different cardiac biomarkers were used to identify myocardial injury.[12] In the 1960s and 1970s, biomarkers such as aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine kinase (CK) were used; these were phased out due to a lack of specificity for cardiac muscle.[13] The next generation of biomarkers was more specific to cardiac muscle, including CK-MB and LDH 1+2. However, these markers
