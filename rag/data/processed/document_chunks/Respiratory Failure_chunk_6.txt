history should be investigated, including exposure to second-hand smoke, marijuana smoking, smoking e-cigarettes, and vaping.[18] Finally, an occupational history may be helpful when considering work-related lung disease (i.e., hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pneumoconiosis), while a family history may be beneficial when considering atopic, genetic (ie, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis), and infectious diseases (i.e., tuberculosis).[19] **Physical Examination** Signs of respiratory failure may be present throughout the body. Physical examination findings by region appear below: - General inspection: Accessory muscle use, altered mental status, cachectic, conversational dyspnea, diaphoresis, fever, respiratory distress (i.e., at rest or with exertion), obesity, and purse-lipped breathing - Head: Cushingoid appearance, central cyanosis, Horner's syndrome, and pale conjunctiva - Neck: Jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy, and tracheal deviation - Chest/thorax: Asymmetrical chest expansion, bradypnea, bronchial breath sounds, Cheyne-Stoke breathing, crackles, decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, hyper-resonance to percussion, Kussmaul breathing, kyphoscoliosis, loud P2, paradoxical breathing, pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum, pleural rub, reduced chest expansion, rhonchi, stridor, tachypnea, tactile vocal fremitus, vesicular breath sounds, vocal resonance, wheezes, and whispering pectoriloquy - Abdomen: Hepatomegaly - Upper extremities: Asterixis, digital clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tobacco staining, and tremor - Lower extremities: Edema, peripheral cyanosis, and unilateral swelling.[20] ## Evaluation As discussed above, respiratory failure is a syndrome caused by a multitude of pathological states. As such, a single algorithm for evaluating respiratory failure does not exist. Appropriate diagnostic studies may include laboratory assays (i.e., complete blood count with the differential, comprehensive metabolic panel with magnesium/phosphorous, procalcitonin, troponin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone), infectious workup (i.e., blood cultures, sputum cultures, respiratory pathogen panel test, and urinary antigen test), and 12-lead electrocardiography. Evaluation of respiratory failure with arterial blood gas, capnometry, radiography, pulse oximetry, and ultrasonography are discussed below. **Arterial Blood Gas** Arterial blood gas (ABG) is the gold standard for diagnosing respiratory failure. At a minimum, the information obtained from an ABG includes pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and serum bicarbonate (HCO3). It should be noted that the HCO3 obtained from an ABG is a calculated value and may, therefore, be inaccurate. Analysis of an ABG should instead be performed using a measured HCO3 obtained from a basic metabolic panel. Oxygenation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaO2. Hypoxemia is defined as a PaO2 less than 60 mmHg. Ventilation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaCO2. Hypercapnia is defined as a PaCO2 greater than
