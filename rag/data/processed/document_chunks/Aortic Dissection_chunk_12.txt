and valve replacement) is based on the extent of root involvement. - Management of aortic arch involvement - AADs that extend into the aortic arch are among the most complex to manage surgically, given the need for cerebral protection and the higher risk of neurologic complications, including paraplegia. - **Stanford type B dissections (involving the descending aorta)** - Medical management - Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed with aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control. The goal is to reduce aortic wall stress, prevent progression, and monitor for complications. - Indications for intervention - Endovascular or surgical intervention is indicated for: - Malperfusion syndromes - Dissections causing ischemia to organs such as the kidneys, intestines, or limbs require urgent intervention. - Aortic rupture or impending rupture - Rapid expansion, recurrent pain, or signs of contained rupture mandate immediate repair. - Interventions - Endovascular stent-grafting - Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is preferred for complicated type B dissections.[2][21][22] TEVAR involves placing a stent-graft to seal the dissection entry tear and exclude the false lumen, promoting healing and remodeling of the aorta. TEVAR is associated with significantly lower morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical repair. However, patient selection is key, as factors like anatomy, dissection extent, and complications influence outcomes. - Surgical repair - Open surgery for type B dissections is reserved for cases where TEVAR is not feasible or for patients with severe complications. Open repair is associated with a higher risk of paraplegia due to potential spinal cord ischemia. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnoses of aortic dissection include the following conditions: - Myocardial infarction - Aortic aneurysm - Cardiac tamponade (from another cause) - Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) - Spontaneous pneumothorax - Pulmonary embolism - Stroke or transient ischemic attack ## Prognosis The prognosis of aortic dissection varies significantly depending on multiple factors, including the type and location of the dissection, timing of intervention, and presence of complications. Acute aortic dissection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly when diagnosis and management are delayed. A prompt and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can markedly improve survival outcomes. **Prognosis Based on Dissection Type** - **Stanford type A dissections** - Mortality without treatment - Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the high risk of fatal complications, such as cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Without intervention, the mortality rate increases by 1%
