Acute bronchitis ranks among the top 10 most common outpatient illnesses in the United States, affecting approximately 5% of adults annually. This activity discusses the evaluation and management of patients afflicted by acute bronchitis, accentuating the pivotal role played by the interprofessional healthcare team in delivering comprehensive care for these individuals. This activity provides healthcare professionals with the latest insights and evidence-based approaches to enhance their competence in diagnosing and managing acute bronchitis, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare team performance. **Objectives:** - Apply the key clinical features of acute bronchitis for an accurate diagnosis to distinguish it from other respiratory conditions and differentiate between viral and bacterial causes. - Assess patients presenting with acute bronchitis for underlying risk factors, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or immunosuppression, to develop appropriate management plans. - Implement evidence-based guidelines and treatment options for acute bronchitis, emphasizing nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions as needed. - Collaborate with the interprofessional team to collectively provide evidence-based education on acute bronchitis, treatment expectations, and preventive measures.

This condition involves the lower respiratory tract, specifically targeting the bronchi, the prominent air passages responsible for air transport within the lungs. Acute bronchitis manifests as an inflammation of these bronchi without evidence of pneumonia and typically affects individuals without underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is characterized by an acute onset of a persistent cough, with or without sputum production. As a self-limiting condition, it typically follows a benign course, resolving spontaneously over 1 to 3 weeks. The etiology of these symptoms arises from the inflammatory response within the lower respiratory tract, often triggered by viral infections.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Acute bronchitis presents as a clinical syndrome characterized by a transient and self-limiting inflammation, specifically targeting the larger and mid-sized airways, and devoid of any evidence of pneumonia upon chest radiography examination. This condition primarily
