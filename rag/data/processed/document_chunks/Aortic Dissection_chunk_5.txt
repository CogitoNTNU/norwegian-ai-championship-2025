the aorta's overall resilience. This makes the aorta susceptible to dilation, aneurysm formation, and dissection. - Disorganization refers to the loss of the parallel arrangement of elastic fibers, which are normally aligned in an orderly fashion to withstand pressure. When disorganized, the fibers are haphazardly arranged and unable to function effectively, leading to a loss of structural cohesion and increasing the risk of tears within the aortic wall. - Altered smooth muscle cells - Smooth muscle cells undergo nuclear loss and disorganization. - Nuclear cell loss, so-called “smooth muscle cell necrosis,” can appear in bands or as wide areas where only the ghost cell contours are visible. The disarray of smooth muscle cells can be focal or nodular. - Laminar medial collapse - The collapsing of elastic fibers represents “laminar medial necrosis” and is coupled with significant loss of interposed smooth muscle cells. - Collagen fibrosis - Collagen fibers can become fibrotic; this is the least common process in degenerative aortic disease. These findings are often combined and must be carefully recognized to accurately grade the degree of medial degeneration as mild, moderate, or severe. This grading is determined by evaluating the severity and distribution of the degenerative lesions observed within the aortic wall.[13][14] Each category reflects the extent of structural damage, including alterations in elastic fibers, smooth muscle cell integrity, and the extracellular matrix. Identifying these changes is crucial for understanding the underlying pathology and predicting potential outcomes, as more severe degeneration is associated with a higher risk of complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. Histopathological evaluation using stains like Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Alcian blue, and Masson trichrome can reveal the extent of these alterations. The vasa vasorum, a network of small vessels supplying the outer layers of the aortic wall, plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the media. Dysfunction of the vasa vasorum, such as obstruction or thickening, can lead to medial necrosis and contribute to the development of aortic dissection. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for medial degeneration and aortic dissection, causing intimal thickening, aortic stiffness, and damage to the elastic fibers.[15][16] Aging exacerbates these degenerative processes, with a loss of elastin, increased collagen deposition, and microcalcifications in the media, further increasing the risk in older populations.[17] This is the primary physiological reason for the high epidemiological correlation between age and aortic diseases such as aneurysms and dissection.[12] Genetic factors also contribute
