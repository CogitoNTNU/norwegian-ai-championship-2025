several complicating factors increase mortality, including right ventricular infarction, hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, and cardiogenic shock.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Inferior wall myocardial infarctions are due to ischemia and infarction to the inferior region of the heart. In 80% of patients, the inferior wall of the heart is supplied by the right coronary artery via the posterior descending artery. In the other 20% of patients, the posterior descending artery is a branch of the circumflex artery.[4] ## Epidemiology There were 8.6 million myocardial infarctions in 2013 worldwide. Inferior wall myocardial infarctions are estimated to be 40% to 50% of all myocardial infarctions. They have a better prognosis than other myocardial infarctions, with a mortality of 2% to 9%. However, up to 40% of inferior wall myocardial infarctions are associated with right ventricular involvement, which results in a worse outcome.[5] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of myocardial infarction involves the rupture of a coronary artery plaque, thrombosis, and blockage of the downstream perfusion, leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. The culprit vessel in most patients is the right coronary artery, which feeds the posterior descending artery. This anatomy is said to be right dominant. Most patients have left dominant anatomy with the posterior coronary artery supplied from the circumflex artery. The most common ECG finding with inferior wall myocardial infarction is ST elevation in ECG leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in lead aVL. The right coronary artery perfuses the AV node, so bradycardias, heart blocks, and arrhythmias are associated with inferior wall myocardial infarctions.[6] ## History and Physical The history should focus on the usual investigation for acute coronary syndrome. Symptoms include chest pain, heaviness or pressure, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis with radiation to the jaw or arms. Other symptoms often include fatigue, lightheadedness, or nausea. During the physical exam, particular attention should be given to the heart rate since bradycardia and heart block may occur. Likewise, hypotension and evidence of poor perfusion should be assessed, especially if there is concomitant right ventricular infarction. ## Evaluation Early and serial ECGs are an essential part of the evaluation. ECG leads II, III, and aVF correlate with the inferior wall of the heart (see **Image.** ECG With Pardee Waves Indicating AMI). ST-segment elevation in those leads indicates an inferior wall STEMI. Reciprocal ST depression is often seen in lead aVL. Almost half of the inferior wall infarctions are associated with right
