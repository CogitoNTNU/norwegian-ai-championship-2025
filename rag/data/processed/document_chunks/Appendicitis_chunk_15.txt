undergoing investigation, intravenous access should be contained and fluids administered; the patient should be kept NPO until a definitive diagnosis is made. Controversy exists regarding the optimal management of an appendiceal mass or phlegmon and the appropriate timing for surgery. There is no longer any question that laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with minimal pain and faster recovery, but it is costly. Other studies indicate that a single small incision provides comparable results to a laparoscopic appendectomy and is cost-effective. Given these controversies, an interprofessional team approach to the diagnosis and management of appendicitis must be established in each institution to ensure that the patient has no morbidity and that the management is cost-effective.[57] [Level 3] **Outcomes** Numerous large series have demonstrated that open and laparoscopic procedures yield excellent outcomes when treating simple appendicitis. [Level 3] However, more severe and complicated appendicitis is associated with poorer outcomes and increased utilization of resources. Further, the atypical presentation of appendicitis in pregnant patients and older individuals also makes diagnosis difficult and leads to a higher incidence of complications.[58][59] [Level 3] In an era of managed care where quality care indices are closely monitored, healthcare workers must be familiar with the current standards of diagnosing and managing appendicitis. Failure to adhere to these standards may result in denial of reimbursement. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17784&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17784) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/procedures/appendicitis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17784) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17784/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17784) [![Image ](/books/NBK493193/bin/intuss__appy__CT__2.gif)](/books/NBK493193/figure/article-17784.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK493193/figure/article-17784.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Abdomen CT, Acute Appendicitis Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant with findings of acute appendicitis](/books/NBK493193/bin/us__composite.gif)](/books/NBK493193/figure/article-17784.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK493193/figure/article-17784.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant with findings of acute appendicitis.
