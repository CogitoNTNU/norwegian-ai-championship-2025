where thrombi form in patients with atrial fibrillation, and in those with a contraindication to anticoagulation, a left atrial appendage closure device such as a Watchman device may be placed. Interventional cardiologists are able to use 3D echocardiography to simulate the procedure morphology prior to placing the closure device.[30] 3D echocardiography is an invaluable tool that is being used more frequently with all forms of echocardiography to improve clinical assessments. Contrast Echocardiography: When a patient has an embolic cerebrovascular accident, the most common origin is cardioembolic. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography is performed to assess for the presence of a patent foramen ovale, which may require surgical closure.[18] Agitated saline is used as a contrast media and injected into the right atrium, which is routinely called a "bubble study," TTE is performed to detect the passing of the bubbles from the right atrium to the left atrium. When a patient is to undergo cardioversion for arrhythmia and has not been anticoagulated for at least three weeks, a TEE is often performed to identify possible left atrial appendage thrombus and prevent dislodgement during cardioversion. Echocardiography contrast may obscure the visualization of a thrombus; on the other hand, hypoechogenic thrombi may be obscured during standard TEE.[32] Two studies involved using contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced TEE in the detection of cardiac thrombi found that contrast-enhanced imaging was able to better delineate thrombi and was able to further identify the presence of thrombi more frequently than non-contrast-enhanced imaging.[33][34] If non-contrast imaging is inconclusive, then the use of contrast-enhanced imaging may be warranted. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The decision to order an echocardiogram requires an interprofessional team approach. The assessment of fluid status is a physical exam finding that can be performed not only by physicians but also by the nursing staff, and this can be used to help aid in the decision to order an echocardiogram. Interprofessional communication is important when treating any patient, including those with a cardiac history, and it is vital for all staff to continuously assess a patient's fluid status and need for further imaging assessments. Adequate communication about the specific indication for echocardiography for each specific patient, will help ensure optimal views and help improve the clinical utility of this test. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20863&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20863) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/echocardiogram-heart-ultrasound/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20863) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20863/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20863) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK558940/figure/article-20863.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK558940/figure/article-20863.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Transesophageal Echocardiogram.
