etiology, additional laboratory investigations should then be considered to focus on autoimmune and uncommon infectious etiologies. **Laboratory** A lumbar puncture should be performed if no clear etiology can be found on initial testing. Routine CSF studies, including cell count, protein, glucose, lactate, markers of inflammation (oligoclonal bands and IgG index), gram stain, bacteria culture, and cytology should be sent. Additional CSF studies should include fungal stain and cultures for M. tuberculosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV-1/2, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), HIV-1/2, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and VDRL in selected cases when the etiology remains unknown.[26] In approximately 2/3 of NORSE cases, mild CSF pleocytosis (≤ 10 cells/μl) with elevated protein and normal glucose can be seen, with no significant difference in CSF findings between cryptogenic cases and cases with identifiable etiology.[11] HSV PCR has high sensitivity (98 %) and specificity (99 %) and is positive early in the course of HSV meningitis/encephalitis. However, HSV PCR can be negative when LP is performed less than 24 hours from the onset of neurological symptoms. Both CSF and serum should be tested for autoimmune anti-NMDA receptor, anti-VGKC (LGI1 and Caspr2), anti-AMPA, anti-GABA, and paraneoplastic antibodies (Anti-Hu, anti-CRMP5, anti-amphiphysin, anti-VGCC). An autoimmune panel (ANA, ANCA, Anti Ro, Anti La, Antithyroid antibodies, anti-Scl-70) should be sent for further testing. Viral serologies, most commonly HSV-1/2, VZV, EBV, enterovirus, and HIV-1/2, should be ordered in all patients with NORSE.[26] For immunocompromised patients, serologies should be sent for IgG Cryptococcus species, IgM and IgG Histoplasma capsulatum, and IgG Toxoplasma gondii. Stool specimens should be investigated for adenovirus and enterovirus. A scrotal ultrasound, pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomographic (CT) scan, and whole-body PET-CT are recommended to screen for an underlying malignancy in patients with suspicion for a paraneoplastic process. **Neuroimaging** All patients with NORSE and FIRES should have a brain MRI with contrast, including venography and angiography, to evaluate structural or focal abnormalities. In approximately 60% of NORSE cases, symmetrical or asymmetrical abnormalities can be seen on the brain MRI.[11] The most common findings observed include hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR sequences within the limbic and neocortical structures, often bilaterally. Other brain regions like the claustrum, basal ganglia/thalami, and peri-insular cortex can show abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity.[27][28] **Electroencephalography (EEG)** All patients should have continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) to assess seizure type and frequency, rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and monitor therapy response.
