cardiac arrhythmias that may increase the risk of vascular disease or a thrombotic event. - Consider early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy after the onset of CVA. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The effective management of ischemic stroke demands a cohesive and interprofessional healthcare team dedicated to delivering patient-centered care, improving outcomes, and maximizing safety and team performance. This approach includes physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, neuroimaging technicians, rehabilitation therapists, and stroke specialists working together. Prompt recognition and treatment of ischemic stroke is critical. Emergency medicine providers must be adept at identifying early stroke symptoms to initiate immediate care. Neuroimaging technicians and radiologists are essential for quickly obtaining and interpreting scans such as CTs and MRIs, which are vital for confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Neurointeventionalists may be needed to provide interventions such as thrombectomies. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the timely administration of thrombolytic agents when appropriate and in managing the patient's medication regimen to prevent complications and secondary strokes. Nurses monitor patients closely for changes in condition and manage care protocols. Rehabilitation therapists are vital to the patient's recovery process, starting in the acute phase and continuing through long-term rehabilitation. The prognosis for patients treated with TPA is good, but the outcomes are guarded for those who do not receive thrombolytic medication.[72] Effective communication among all team members is paramount for the rapid diagnosis, decision-making, and implementation of treatment plans. This collaboration facilitates a comprehensive approach to care, from acute management to rehabilitation and secondary prevention. All care decisions should be based on ethical considerations, including informed consent and respect for patient autonomy. The team prioritizes shared decision-making, respecting patient preferences while ensuring beneficence and non-maleficence. An interprofessional healthcare team approach is essential for a timely and effective response, minimizing complications, and prioritizing patient safety and quality of care in managing ischemic stroke. Education and ongoing professional development are essential. They ensure the healthcare team remains knowledgeable about the latest evidence-based practices in stroke care, from acute management to prevention of recurrence. Through dedicated collaboration, the healthcare team will provide patient-centered care from emergency care to rehabilitation, ultimately enhancing outcomes and quality of life for affected patients. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23776&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23776) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/stroke/ischemic-stroke-stroke/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23776) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23776/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23776) [![Axial Section on Noncontrast CT Head Shows Left PCA Ischemic Stroke and
