highest risk and greater 5-year mortality for heart failure than the White population in the United States. The European Society of Cardiology states that the prevalence of heart failure is 1% to 2% and rises to greater than 10% in the population of those aged 70 and older.[1][3] **Heart Failure Statistics** - Heart failure survival has improved over time, yet the absolute 5-year mortality rates from diagnosis for heart failure have remained at 50% - Heart failure is the number 1 diagnosis among all hospitalizations, and the cost of annual heart failure care exceeds $30 billion every year. - Most of the cost spent on heart failure patients is for hospitalizations and readmissions.[1] **Acute Heart Failure** Although consensus guidelines tend to use the term heart failure to refer to those with established chronic disease, acute heart failure is defined as a more rapid onset of signs and symptoms or the gradual worsening of chronic symptoms that necessitate intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure exacerbation that requires hospitalization tends to occur in the older adult population, with a mean age of 79 years and a slightly higher preponderance of women affected than men.[1][2][3] Data from the United Kingdon National Heart Failure Audit show mortality rates of approximately 10% during the index admission, 30-day postdischarge mortality of 6.5%, and 1-year mortality of 30%.[3] ## Pathophysiology Heart failure can arise from various cardiovascular or metabolic abnormalities. Still, in most cases, clinical symptoms are due to left ventricular dysfunction and may be preserved or reduced when left ventricular dysfunction is present. The ejection fraction is a key measure often used to select patients for clinical trials and guide therapeutic decisions. In contrast, pulmonary edema seen in acute decompensated heart failure results from the dysregulation of pulmonary fluid homeostasis, disrupting the balance of forces controlling fluid movement into the alveolar space.[4][6] ## History and Physical Heart failure is predominately a clinical diagnosis. The presentation of heart failure may vary based on each patient; therefore, it is essential to consider the following during the history and physical: - **History:** If the patient has a history of past heart failure, ask if this is the same presentation as when they had previous episodes of heart failure or an acute decompensation. - **Symptom Causes:** Consider noncardiac and other causes of the patient's symptoms, as it is important to ensure a broad differential diagnosis and avoid anchoring bias, premature closer,
