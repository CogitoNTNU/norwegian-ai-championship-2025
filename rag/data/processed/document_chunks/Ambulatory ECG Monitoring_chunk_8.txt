premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), occurring at an average of 1870 PVCs in 24 hours; supraventricular premature beats (SPBs) occurred at an average of 699 SPBs within the same timeframe. Additionally, supraventricular tachycardia was reported in 34% of the subjects.[52] A retrospective investigation by Konecny et al of 6351 patients analyzed the incidence of ventricular tachycardia within a population of patients with COPD using Holter monitoring. Patients with COPD exhibited a higher prevalence of VT compared to their healthy counterparts; the occurrence of VT increased with the severity of COPD.[53] Another study demonstrated arrhythmias in 72% of patients with COPD during ambulatory Holter monitoring.[54] **Dialysis and End-Stage Renal Disease** Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including arrhythmia.[55] Hemodialysis results in substantial hemodynamic and perfusion shifts; the dialysis procedure itself has been established as a contributor to the onset of atrial fibrillation.[56][57] A cross-sectional study by Rantanen et al utilized 48-hour Holter monitors initiated just before each dialysis session in 152 patients and revealed PACs and PVCs in most patients; paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia affected 41% of studied patients. Another 8.6% of patients exhibited persistent atrial fibrillation, 3.9% experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 19.7% had NSVT, 4.6% had bradycardia, 1.3% had second-degree atrioventricular block, and 2.6% experienced third-degree atrioventricular block. PVCs were more prevalent on dialysis days, and tachyarrhythmias were more pronounced during dialysis and the immediate post-dialytic phase.[58] This data suggest that ambulatory ECG monitoring during dialysis could promote the early detection of arrhythmias in asymptomatic patients, which may prompt timely strategies for effective management. **Mitral Valve Prolapse** Arrhythmias are a frequent manifestation in patients with mitral valve prolapse. In patients with prominent symptoms or detectable auscultatory findings, ambulatory ECG monitoring demonstrates a substantial prevalence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Symptoms commonly experienced by those with mitral valve prolapse include dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, and chest pain. Ambulatory ECG monitoring assesses these symptoms and establishes if arrhythmias contribute to their occurrence [59]. One study revealed that only 27% of symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse exhibited arrhythmias linked to their symptoms.[60] **Pre-Excitation Syndrome** Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by an anomalous accessory electrical pathway within the heart and intermittent symptoms. Traditional resting 12-lead ECGs occasionally fail to detect WPW syndrome, prompting the consideration of ambulatory ECG monitoring. Among confirmed patients with WPW syndrome, ambulatory ECG monitoring has demonstrated that pre-excitation is intermittent in up to 67% of
