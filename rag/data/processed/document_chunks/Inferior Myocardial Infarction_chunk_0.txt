Approximately 40 percent of myocardial infarctions involve the inferior wall. Traditionally, inferior MIs have a better prognosis than those in other regions, such as the anterior wall of the heart. The mortality rate of an inferior wall MI is less than 10 percent. However, several complicating factors can lead to increased mortality, including right ventricular infarction, hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, and cardiogenic shock. This activity examines when a myocardial infarction should be considered in differential diagnosis, how to evaluate it properly, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients. **Objectives:** - Identify how patients can lessen their risk of myocardial infarction by optimizing their modifiable risk factors. - Assess features suggestive of inferior wall myocardial infarction. - Evaluate the proper management of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. - Communicate how the coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of myocardial infarction and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.

Unless there is timely treatment, this results in myocardial ischemia followed by infarction. In most patients, the right coronary artery supplies the inferior myocardium. In about 6-10% of the population, the left circumflex supplies the posterior descending coronary artery because of left dominance. Approximately 40% of all myocardial infarctions involve the inferior wall. Traditionally, inferior myocardial infarctions have a better prognosis than those in other regions, such as the anterior wall of the heart. The mortality rate of an inferior wall myocardial infarction is less than 10%. However, several complicating factors increase mortality, including right ventricular infarction, hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, and cardiogenic shock.[1][2][3] ## Etiology Inferior wall myocardial infarctions are due to ischemia and infarction to the inferior region of the heart. In 80% of patients, the inferior wall of the heart is supplied by the right
