the overall duration of illness.[29] Consequently, antibiotic use should be avoided in uncomplicated cases of acute bronchitis, considering factors such as the cost of antibiotics, the increasing global concern of antibiotic resistance, and the potential side effects associated with antibiotic usage. Numerous other international medical societies also advise against antibiotic use in cases of viral acute bronchitis. Despite these recommendations, many patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis are prescribed antibiotics. It is important to emphasize that no empirical data justify the belief that antibiotic therapy leads to less severe or shorter duration of cough in acute bronchitis. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended only when a treatable pathogen is identified, as with pertussis (see **Table.** Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis). Antiviral treatment should be considered for influenza infection.

Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis. - The use of oseltamivir and zanamivir has been shown to offer minor benefits in reducing the duration of influenza symptoms by an average of half a day in adults. These medications are also effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic influenza when used as a prophylactic measure. However, limited evidence supports the claim that these drugs can reduce the risk of hospital admission or pneumonia. Furthermore, a Cochrane review suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing the person-to-person spread of influenza. The complications associated with influenza, such as pneumonia, cannot be reduced by treatment trials due to the lack of clear diagnostic definitions. The use of oseltamivir has been found to increase the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects, and renal events in adults. Therefore, the balance between the benefits and harms of using neuraminidase inhibitors for prophylaxis or treatment should be carefully considered when making decisions.[40] In summary, robust data are lacking supporting the use of beta-agonists, steroids, neuraminidase inhibitors, and mucolytic agents, particularly in patients without underlying COPD and asthma. Treatment decisions should be based on the individual's response to these interventions and the reported benefits while carefully considering the balance between potential risks and benefits in each case. ## Differential Diagnosis Other potential causes of acute cough should be considered, especially when the cough persists for a duration exceeding 3 weeks. Other conditions to consider are as follows: - Asthma: Acute asthma exacerbation can be frequently misdiagnosed as acute bronchitis, with around one-third of
