the lumen from atherosclerosis. The presence of atherosclerosis at the carotids can easily indicate the patient suffers from a disease of the arteries in other areas of the body. This early discovery can direct patient care toward the prevention of further atherosclerosis that could potentially prevent myocardial infarction, stroke, high blood pressure, peripheral vascular disease, and among others.[14] Large vessel vasculitis commonly affects the common carotid arteries and its branches. The vasculitis that directly affects the common carotids right off of the aorta that presents in a young female with decrease upper extremity pulses or claudication can lead to the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis before the patient suffers from irreversible damage.[15] While in an older female, a tender temporal region with jaw claudication can indicate a vasculitis affecting a branch of the external carotid artery suggesting giant cell temporal arteritis. The prompt diagnosis of giant cell arteritis can prevent vision loss before it affects the ophthalmic artery.[16] ## Other Issues The presence of the carotid bodies in the region of the common carotid artery bifurcation can lead to orthostatic hypotension or the resetting of irregular heart arrhythmia. The idea of increased stretch or pressure on the carotid bodies leads to a sudden drop in blood pressure and potentially syncope. Irregular heart arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia can resolve by the carotid massage. The kneading of the carotid bodies causes the baroreceptors to sense an increase in stretch/pressure leading to increase signals to the brain influencing the decrease of heart rate and blood pressure. The reduction in blood pressure is through the lowering of heart rate and increased parasympathetic tone. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=32266&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=32266) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/32266/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=32266) [![Image ](/books/NBK546613/bin/Gray507.gif)](/books/NBK546613/figure/article-32266.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK546613/figure/article-32266.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Arteries of the Head and Neck, External Carotid, Internal Jugular Vein, External Maxillary, Henry Vandyke Carter, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons ## References 1.
