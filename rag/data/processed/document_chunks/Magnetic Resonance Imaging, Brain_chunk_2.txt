demonstrated DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) detection of infarcts within 3 hours of onset, preceding abnormal signal findings on fluid attenuating inversion images, which may not present for 3 TO 6 hours.[8] There is variable clinical use and availability of perfusion imaging to estimate the extent of infarct and compromised parenchyma, which is beyond this topic's scope. CT angiography is the gold standard of craniocervical vascular imaging to rule out obstruction, high-grade stenosis, or dissection. MR angiography could be considered in patients with diminished renal function. Time-of-flight MR angiography is a multidimensional (2-D or 3-D) technique that maps the imaged vessels while subtracting the bony structures and brain parenchyma. Time-of-flight does not require contrast but uses flow-related enhancement properties during image acquisition.[9] Similarly, the dural venous sinuses can be evaluated with MR venography. When considering MRI to evaluate patients for headaches, seizures, demyelinating disease, and suspected mass, it is generally acceptable to request the use of an intravenous contrast agent. For example, post-contrast-enhancing lesions indicate active disease in a patient undergoing imaging evaluation for multiple sclerosis.[10] **Breast** : Breast MR is indicated in very select scenarios due to using a specialized breast coil, a large field of view, and standardized sequences. It is important to inform the patient that the exam is performed in the prone position with the arms extended overhead. Dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI is an important tool to evaluate the extent of breast disease, therapy response, and surveillance of residual or recurrent disease.[11] Under the care and direction of a breast imager, some patients undergo MR-guided biopsy of mammographic or sonographic occult masses. Breast cancer screening with MRI is indicated in patients with a high risk of breast cancers, defined as BRCA gene carriers, patients with first-degree relatives with breast cancers, and those with >20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, in addition to those with a history of radiation to the chest.[11] Dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI is used in conjunction with screening mammography. To assess silicone breast implant integrity and localization of free silicone, a non-contrast MRI of the breasts is performed. Breast imaging departments usually have standard protocols to obtain limited imaging sequences. **Chest/Cardiac** : MRI with IV contrast agents and customized fields of view are appropriate to evaluate chest wall abnormalities that are not definitively diagnosable with other modalities. MRI technologists are educated to mark the area of concern with an MRI visible Vitamin E capsule. While
