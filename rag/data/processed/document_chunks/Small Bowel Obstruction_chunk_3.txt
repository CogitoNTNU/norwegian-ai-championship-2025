Although many patients develop disease recurrence at the anastomosis, some develop SBO without evidence of inflammation at the transition point.[13] Endometriosis can also lead to acute SBO through inflammation or adhesions. Acute SBO secondary to intestinal endometriosis underscores the pivotal role of laparoscopic surgery in the evaluation of SBO.[14] Infectious processes, such as radiation enteritis, may cause delayed-onset obstruction due to fibrosis and ischemia. Approximately a third of patients with chronic radiation enteritis may ultimately require surgical intervention for indications such as obstruction. **Motility Disorders** SBO can also result from intestinal dysmotility (ie, impaired bowel movement without a physical blockage) that can be caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders like chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, where the intestines lack normal peristaltic activity, or by drug-induced motility issues, such as those caused by opioids or anticholinergics.[15] Additionally, enteric myopathies, either primary or secondary to conditions like muscular dystrophy, affect the smooth muscle of the small bowel, leading to motility dysfunction. Enteric neuropathy, caused by neurological or metabolic conditions (eg, diabetes or Parkinson disease), can also disrupt normal motility, presenting with symptoms similar to mechanical SBO. Proper diagnosis requires imaging and sometimes specialized tests to differentiate functional obstructions from mechanical causes, and treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition and supporting motility. **Rare Causes** Small bowel encapsulation is a rare cause of SBO. In this condition, the small intestine is encased by a fibrous membrane within the peritoneum, limiting its movement and potentially causing obstruction. This condition can present as acute or chronic SBO, often requiring imaging such as CT scans for diagnosis.[16] Encapsulation can result from congenital conditions or be secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes. Small bowel volvulus is another uncommon cause, where the bowel twists around its mesentery, obstructing blood flow and causing ischemia. Volvulus can occur anywhere in the small bowel but is more common in the midgut; this leads to bowel distention, pain, and potentially ischemia or necrosis if not treated promptly. Volvulus may be associated with abnormal intestinal mobility or congenital malformations, like malrotation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through radiographic imaging (ie, CT or contrast studies), and surgical intervention is often required to untwist the bowel and prevent ischemia. **Pediatric** Congenital or acquired adhesions are the most common causes of SBO. The second most common cause is intussusception. Other causes include congenital atresia, volvulus, ingestion of foreign bodies, and Meckel diverticulum.[17] ## Epidemiology SBO is a common surgical emergency,
