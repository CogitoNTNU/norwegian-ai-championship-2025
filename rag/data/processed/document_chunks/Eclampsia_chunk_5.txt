occur before, during, or after delivery, with a significant number occurring during the antepartum period. Postpartum eclampsia, particularly late-onset eclampsia, defined as seizures occurring more than 48 hours after delivery, can still pose a significant risk. A large portion of these seizures occurs in the first 7 to 10 days postpartum, often presenting with neurological symptoms, including headache. Postpartum headaches should be carefully evaluated, especially if accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or visual disturbances, to rule out other severe conditions such as cerebral venous thrombosis or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.[11] ## Evaluation Eclampsia is typically the condition initially suspected in patients presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, especially those individuals with a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorder. Evaluating eclampsia primarily involves assessing various aspects of maternal and fetal health due to the condition’s potential impact on multiple organs and the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Because of the urgent nature of eclampsia, this evaluation is conducted alongside emergent therapeutic interventions.[10][11][16] The evaluation for eclampsia is centered around the diagnosis of preeclampsia as it is a known life-threatening complication of this disease process. In addition to serial maternal blood pressure measurements and continuous fetal monitoring, diagnostic studies should be performed to assess for indications of end-organ dysfunction, including proteinuria, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, central nervous system symptoms, pulmonary edema, and thrombocytopenia.[10][11][16] **Laboratory Studies** Key laboratory studies include liver function panels, platelet counts, and complete metabolic profiles to assess kidney function as performed for preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[HELLP syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22684)," for more information on diagnostic laboratory studies. Proteinuria, defined as 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a urinary protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 or greater, is no longer essential for diagnosing preeclampsia and may be absent before the onset of seizure activity; this laboratory test is still included during evaluation.[2][17] Other essential laboratory studies include a hepatic panel to assess liver function, a complete blood count to quantify platelet counts, and a basic metabolic profile to assess kidney function. Platelet levels of 100,000/μL or less and liver transaminase levels more than 2 times the upper limit of normal with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain are also associated with preeclampsia with severe features. Laboratory tests to exclude differential diagnoses for seizures should also be considered, including urine drug screens, complete metabolic panels, or
