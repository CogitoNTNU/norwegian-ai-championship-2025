This condition, predominantly found in postmenopausal females, usually presents after significant emotional or physical stressors. To avoid delayed diagnosis and proper treatment of this condition, health care providers need guidelines for timely and appropriate diagnosis and management of this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients who presented with suspected mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the pathophysiology of mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Review the risk factors for developing mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Outline the typical presentation of a patient with suspected mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Summarize the typical imaging findings associated with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

This condition, predominantly found in postmenopausal females, usually presents after significant emotional or physical stressors. On presentation, patients have signs and symptoms of typical acute coronary artery syndrome (cardiac enzyme elevation, ischemic electrocardiogram changes, and chest pain) but lack coronary obstruction on angiographic evaluation.[1] Different forms of this cardiomyopathy over time are seen in patients and are widely categorized into two categories.[2] **Typical Variant** This type of Takotsubo involves the apical ballooning of the left ventricle during systole with likely hyperkinesis of the basal segments. The majority of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy syndrome fall into the typical variant category. **Atypical Variants** This type of Takotsubo involves the basal, focal, mid-ventricular, biventricular (apical and right ventricle), isolated right ventricular, and global variants. ## Etiology Multiple triggers are associated with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, the exact mechanism of this condition is not fully understood—two separate categories, which include physical triggers and emotional triggers, are known to play a role in the process of developing this cardiomyopathy. Some of these triggers are listed below:[2] Emotional triggers: - Death of a family member -
