the body attempts to preserve oxygen delivery to the brain and heart, blood is shunted away from extremities and nonvital organs. This causes cold and modeled extremities with delayed capillary refill. This shunting ultimately leads to worsening acidosis. The “lethal triad” of trauma is acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. Trauma-induced coagulopathy can occur in the absence of the hemodilution of resuscitation. Damage control resuscitation is based on three principles: permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation, and damage control surgery. Permissive hypotension targets a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, accepting suboptimal perfusion to end organs for a limited time to achieve hemostasis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes There are many causes of shock, and it is important to find the cause as soon as possible. Because shock carries high morbidity and mortality, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, emergency department physician, ICU nurses, general surgeon, internist, and intensivist. With a broader understanding of the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock, treatment in trauma has expanded from a simple massive transfusion method to a more comprehensive management strategy of “damage control resuscitation.” The concept of damage control resuscitation focuses on permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation, and hemorrhage control to adequately treat the “lethal triad” of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia that occurs in trauma. The outcomes depend on the cause, patient age, associated comorbidity, and patient response to treatment.[5][16] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28975&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28975) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/hemorrhagic-shock/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28975) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28975/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28975) ## References 1.
