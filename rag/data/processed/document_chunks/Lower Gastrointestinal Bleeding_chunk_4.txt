- Given to improve visualization at the time of endoscopy - Vasoactive medications - Somatostatin and its analog octreotide can be used to treat variceal bleeding by inhibiting vasodilatory hormone release[14] - Antibiotics - Considered prophylactically in patients with cirrhosis to prevent translocation, especially from endoscopy - Anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents - Should be stopped if possible in acute bleeds - Consider the reversal of agents on a case-by-case basis dependent on the severity of bleeding and risks of reversal - Other - Consider NGT lavage if necessary to remove fresh blood or clots to facilitate endoscopy - Placement of a Blakemore or Minnesota tube should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability/massive GI bleeds in the setting of known varices, which should be done only once the airway is secured. This procedure carries a significant complication risk (including arrhythmias, gastric or esophageal perforation) and should only be done by an experienced provider as a temporizing measure. - Surgery should be consulted promptly in patients with massive bleeding or hemodynamic instability who have bleeding that is not amenable to any other treatment. - In case of diverticular bleeding colonoscopy with bipolar probe coagulation, epinephrine injection, or metallic clips are used. - If angiodysplasia is the cause of lower GI bleed, thermal therapy (eg, electrocoagulation, argon plasma coagulation) is done. ## Differential Diagnosis Few diagnoses mimic GI bleeding. Occasionally, hemoptysis may be confused for hematemesis or vice versa. Ingestion of bismuth-containing products or iron supplements may cause stools to appear melanic. Certain foods/dyes may turn emesis or stool red, purple, or maroon (such as beets). Other differentials to consider in GI bleeding are: **Upper GI Bleeding** - Peptic ulcer disease - Esophagitis - Gastritis and Duodenitis - Varices - Portal hypertensive gastropathy - Angiodysplasia - Dieulafoy lesion - Gastric antral valvular ectasia - Mallory-Weiss tears - Cameron lesion - Aortoenteric fistulas - Foreign body ingestion - Upper GI tumors - Hemobilia - Hemosuccus pancreaticus **Lower GI Bleeding** - Diverticulosis - Angiodysplasia - Infectious colitis - Ischemic colitis - Inflammatory bowel disease - Colon cancer - Hemorrhoids - Anal fissures - Rectal varices - Dieulafoy lesion - Radiation-induced collitis ## Prognosis Limited studies exist regarding the prognosis following GI bleeding. For upper GI bleeds, in-hospital mortality rates are approximately 10% based on observational studies. This rate holds steady up to 1-month post-hospitalization for GI bleed. Long-term follow-up of patients with UGIB shows that at
