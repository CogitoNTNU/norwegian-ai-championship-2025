due to precipitation of calcium soaps, shock, and organ failures such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure.[11] Elevated serum levels of lipase and amylase may or may not be present in chronic pancreatitis, in contrast to acute pancreatitis, where serum lipase is almost always elevated. Chronic pancreatitis is due to chronic inflammation, calcification, and atrophy of the pancreas. The primary causes of chronic pancreatitis include chronic alcohol abuse in adults and genetic predispositions such as cystic fibrosis in children. The complications of chronic pancreatitis include deficiency of pancreatic enzymes and the formation of pseudocysts. Pancreatic insufficiency usually occurs when there is less than ten percent of pancreatic function remaining due to a deficiency in pancreatic enzymes contained within the pancreas to digest fats such as lipase. This pancreatic enzyme deficiency leads to clinical manifestations of steatorrhea, as fat is not absorbed properly in the small intestine and is instead excreted. The inability to absorb fats appropriately can manifest as fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A, D, E, and K) deficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency can also lead to diabetes mellitus due to insufficient insulin release from pancreatic tissue.[12] Clinically, orlistat is a medication used for weight loss that acts on lipase. Specifically, this medication inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipases. This inhibition of the lipases leads to the reduced breakdown and absorption of dietary fats. This can lead to side effects due to decreased absorption of fats, such as reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Other side effects include abdominal pain, frequent bowel movements, bowel urgency, and flatulence.[13] Some cholesterol-lowering drugs act on lipases. Fibrates, such as bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate, work by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) and upregulating lipoprotein lipase (LpL), which leads to a decrease in serum triglyceride levels along with induction of increased synthesis of HDL. Fibrates are clinically indicated primarily for lowering triglycerides. Side effects of fibrates include cholesterol gallstones, rhabdomyolysis, mainly if used with statins, and increased LDL.[14] Niacin, or vitamin B3, is another cholesterol-lowering medication that acts on lipase. Specifically, niacin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase, leading to inhibition of VLDL synthesis in the liver. Niacin is clinically indicated primarily for increasing HDL levels. The side effects are erythema and flushing of the upper body, increased glucose levels, increased uric acid levels, acanthosis nigricans, and pruritus.[15] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=24303&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=24303) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/24303/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=24303) ## References 1.
