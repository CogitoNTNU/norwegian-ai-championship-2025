best illustrated in cases requiring regular monitoring of disease progression, most notably multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. MRI also offers a lower-risk diagnostic evaluation for those who are at a high risk of long-term radiation-related complications, such as children and pregnant women. The alternative non-contrast techniques used in MRI are important for time-sensitive neurological imaging; for example, MR arteriography assists in assessing the craniocervical vasculature in suspected stroke patients with poor renal function or severe iodinated contrast allergies. In summary, the judicious use of MRI by ordering clinicians is critical for positive patient outcomes, timely diagnosis, and healthcare costs. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes As healthcare costs continue to soar, it is the responsibility of healthcare providers to order advanced imaging judiciously. Not all facilities have access to MRI, and, as mentioned, there are strong preliminary imaging modalities widely available that can guide care and treatment. The clinician can inquire if the clinical question was addressed on recent existing imaging. Conversation with your radiology colleagues can also answer if the exam being ordered is appropriate. While MRI is our most technologically advanced modality, it is not appropriate in all situations. Medicare spends $10 billion annually on imaging, a good portion of which is repeat or unnecessary.[21] Fragmented health information exchange between healthcare systems contributes to repeat imaging because of the lack of access to prior exams. A study of 196,314 patients showed that 7.7% of imaging was repeated within 90 days when prior imaging was inaccessible.[22] Thus, all interprofessional team members can contribute to improved allocation of resources by integrating the radiology department into the multidisciplinary care team. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=24648&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=24648) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/24648/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=24648) ## References 1.
