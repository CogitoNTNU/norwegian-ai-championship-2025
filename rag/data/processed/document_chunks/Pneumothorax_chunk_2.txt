fractures and gunshot wounds. - Iatrogenic pneumothorax: A subtype of traumatic pneumothorax caused by medical interventions, such as central line insertion, thoracentesis, device implantation, computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation or resuscitation.[10][11][12][13] - Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs without external trauma and is divided into 2 categories. - Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Develops in individuals without underlying lung disease - Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in individuals with significant underlying parenchymal lung disease, such as COPD or cystic fibrosis), often triggered by events such as bleb rupture.[14] Pneumothorax can also be classified into 4 categories based on its physiological impact: - Simple pneumothorax - No communication with the outside atmosphere - No mediastinal or diaphragmatic shift - Example: A pleural laceration from a fractured rib [15] - Communicating pneumothorax - Occurs when a defect in the chest wall creates an open connection between the pleura space and the external environment, such as a gunshot wound - Results in paradoxical lung collapse and severe ventilatory impairment [16] - Tension pneumothorax - Progressive air accumulation in the pleural cavity leads to: - Mediastinal shift to the opposite side - Compression of the vena cava and great vessels, reducing diastolic filling - Compromised cardiac output, leading to hemodynamic instability - Occurs when a one-way valve effect traps air in the pleural space, preventing its escape. - Catamenial pneumothorax - A rare, nontraumatic pneumothorax that occurs in women of childbearing age, typically within 3 to 4 days after menstruation onset - Often affects the right lung. - Believed to be caused by pleural endometriosis, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Other causes of pneumothorax include barotrauma, occurring from scuba diving or air travel, especially in individuals with preexisting lung disease.[17] In addition, individuals with underlying lung cysts or bullae are at an increased risk of developing pneumothorax in response to rapid pressure changes. ## Epidemiology The incidence of nontraumatic pneumothorax ranges from 7.4 to 18 cases per 100,000 people annually.[18] However, the risk is significantly higher among smokers, with a lifetime risk of 12% compared to 0.1% in nonsmokers.[19] Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly affects tall, thin-built young males, particularly those who smoke.[20] The condition has a high recurrence rate, with 20% to 60% of patients experiencing a recurrence within the first 3 years following their initial episode. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in individuals with underlying lung disease, resulting in significant variation in its epidemiology.
