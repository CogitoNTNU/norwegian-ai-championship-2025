has a concentration of 200 units/mL, whereas the nasal solution delivers 200 units per actuation. Nasal administration of the medication offers a bioavailability of only 25% of the injectable form and is characterized by a slower absorption rate. In the injectable form, the SQ route is preferred for volumes less than 2 mL, whereas the IM route is recommended for volumes exceeding 2 mL. Self-administration through the SQ route or intranasal spray is recommended in an outpatient setting. Both intranasal spray and injectable forms are viable options for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the injectable form is the preferred choice when addressing conditions such as Paget disease of bone and hypercalcemia. Patients should be provided with supplementary calcium at a dosage of 1000 mg/d and vitamin D at a dosage of 400 IU/d alongside calcitonin therapy.[24][25][26] Oral administration of calcitonin is currently being investigated, and preliminary results are promising.[3] Adult dosages of calcitonin for managing postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and hypercalcemia are listed below. - Postmenopausal osteoporosis: For SQ or IM administration, 100 IU of the medication should be taken daily. The nasal spray option requires alternating nostrils daily and using 200 units per actuation. - Paget disease of bone: The recommended initial dosage is 100 IU daily through SQ or IM injection. A daily dosage of 50 IU or a range of 50 to 100 IU every 1 to 3 days is advised for maintenance. - Hypercalcemia: The initial dosage is typically 4 IU/kg administered every 12 hours via SQ or IM injection. If the response is inadequate, the dosage can be increased up to 8 IU/kg every 6 hours. **Specific Patient Population** Hepatic impairment: As the kidneys and other tissues primarily metabolize calcitonin, not the liver, dosage adjustments are unnecessary for patients with hepatic impairment. Renal impairment: As calcitonin and its metabolites are excreted via the urine, renal impairment can influence their clearance and elevate their exposure, possibly resulting in a prolonged half-life. However, no dosage adjustments are required for patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Pregnancy considerations: The available data on using calcitonin during pregnancy are limited. Although animal studies have not indicated any fetal harm, the data from human studies is insufficient to establish the drug's safety for use in pregnancy. Breastfeeding considerations: The available data on the effects of calcitonin on nursing infants are limited. Consequently, even the nasal spray option of calcitonin is not
