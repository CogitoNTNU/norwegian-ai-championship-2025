abnormalities: These are commonly iatrogenic due to medications that prolong the QT interval. In such circumstances, offending drug discontinuation is sufficient therapy. Inherited Channelopathies: In cases such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and other inherited causes of arrhythmogenic syncope, implantable cardiac defibrillators are the definitive management. The decision regarding when to implant these is patient- and circumstance-dependent.[10] **Implanted Pacemaker Failure** A patient with an implanted pacemaker who presents to a hospital following a syncopal event should have the pacemaker interrogated by any available electrophysiologist. Syncope in the setting of pacemaker failure is usually the result of battery depletion, lead oversensing, or lead underpacing. Such problems can be managed with a device or lead replacement.[17] **Structural Syncope** The management of structural causes of syncope is specific to the structural problem. For example, In cases of aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement is the definitive management. Atrial myxomas or other cardiac tumors should similarly be managed operatively. Heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be managed medically with nitrates and diuretics. Coronary artery disease can be managed with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Acute coronary artery occlusion, when present, can be managed with revascularization techniques such as angioplasty or cardiac bypass surgery. Pulmonary emboli are managed with anticoagulants/thrombolytics. Any patient with an unknown specific etiology of syncope but a known structural cardiac disease can and should be evaluated for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.[17][10] All patients presenting with cardiac syncope who have not had a definitive intervention to prevent future events should be advised not to drive. Patients who have syncopized are 2 to 4 times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions than the general population.[10] ## Differential Diagnosis All patients presenting with a transient, apparent loss of consciousness should be assessed for the possibility of cardiac syncope. However, they could also have any of the many other causes of loss of consciousness. In cases of head trauma preceding loss of consciousness, a patient is considered to have had a concussion. Nontraumatic transient loss of consciousness can occur from other sources of syncope or non-syncopal events such as seizures; metabolic disturbances like hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypoxia, or hypocapnia); vertebrobasilar cerebral transient ischemic events; alcohol intoxication or other central nervous system depressant substance use; pseudoseizures; or psychogenic pseudosyncope. In these instances, loss of consciousness or presumed loss of consciousness is not due to global cerebral hypoperfusion, as is the case in syncope. Among transient loss
