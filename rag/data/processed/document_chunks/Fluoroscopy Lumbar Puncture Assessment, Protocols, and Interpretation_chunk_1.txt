paraspinal fascia, muscles and then epidural fat, and the dura.[5] The thecal sac is an extension of the subarachnoid space of the brain. In the spinal canal, the thecal sac is formed by the outer dura and inner arachnoid mater. The thecal sac contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the spinal cord with pia mater, and nerves. Varying amounts of epidural fat covers the thecal sac. The lumbar vertebra encloses the spinal cord, nerve roots, thecal sac, and epidural fat. The periosteum covers the vertebra and then paraspinal muscles with their fascia. The subcutaneous fat and skin are present most superficially. ## Indications **Indications for Lumbar Puncture** 1. A sampling of the CSF for laboratory analysis to detect infection, malignancy, inflammatory/demyelinating disorders. 1. To determine the CSF pressure in suspected cases of increased intracranial pressure (infection, malignancy, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension). 1. Chemotherapy drug administration into the thecal sac 1. Myelography and cisternography. 1. Blood patch for CSF leak 1. Baclofen administration as a pump trial. 1. Lumbar shunt placement procedure. **Indications for Fluoroscopy-guided Lumbar Puncture** 1. Failed bedside attempt (most common indication). 1. Obesity 1. Prior lumbar spine surgery/hardware 1. Severe degenerative spinal disease and scoliosis. 1. Lack of training to do the procedure. 1. Patients request to avoid failed attempts, particularly after the first failed attempt. ## Contraindications **1. Coagulopathy and anticoagulant** s: Guidelines are available to follow during day-to-day practice.[6][7] For general-purpose discussion, any uncorrected coagulopathy can cause a spinal hematoma resulting in the spinal cord or nerve compression, which may require emergent surgery for decompression. Patients must have the INR corrected to \<1.5 and have the platelet count > 50000. The aPTT in patients receiving unfractionated heparin should be more than 1.5 x normal. Warfarin - Warfarin to be held for 5 days, and INR is confirmed at 1.5 or less. - Warfarin resumed within 12-24 hr after the procedure. Heparin - Unfractionated subcutaneous or IV heparin - wait for at least 4 hr after the previous dose and check aPtt, resume 1 hr after the procedure. Lovenox - Withhold the last dose or wait for 24 hr after the previous dose. Resume 6 hrs after the procedure. Fondaparinux - Withhold 48 hrs before the procedure. Resume therapy after 6 hrs. Rivaroxaban - Withhold 48hrs before the procedure. Resume therapy after 48h. Argatroban and Desirudin - Wait for 4 hrs after the last dose to do the procedure.
