further. Alternatively, sending a D-dimer test may be adequate in certain patient populations. Typical laboratory tests also should be sent to evaluate for coagulation status, blood count, and renal function.[[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470381/)[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470381/)[35] ## Treatment / Management Treatment of DVT aims to prevent pulmonary embolism, reduce morbidity, and prevent or minimize the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome. The cornerstone of treatment is anticoagulation. NICE guidelines only recommend treating proximal DVT (not distal) and those with pulmonary emboli. In each patient, the risks of anticoagulation need to be weighed against the benefits.[36][37][38] Treatment for DVT should be addressed mainly according to the underlying causality of DVT as follows: - The preferred anticoagulant to address DVT in cancer-associated thromboembolism is low molecular weight heparin and factor Xa inhibitors, including rivaroxaban.[39] However, in the following circumstances, the higher levels of anticoagulation should be considered: 1. recently diagnosed cancer, 2. extensive VTE circumstances, and 3. cancer treatment-related adverse effects, including vomiting.[40] - In circumstances where once-daily oral therapy is the preferred management, the following options are viable; 1. rivaroxaban, 2. edoxaban, and 3. vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) - In the context of liver disease, DVT should be managed with low-molecular-weight heparin.[41] Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated in raised INR levels. - In patients with renal disease suppressed creatinine clearance to less than 30 ml/min, VKAs are recommended. DOACs and LMWH should be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease. - In patients with a remarkable past medical history of coronary artery disease, the following alternatives are recommended: 1. VKA, 2. rivaroxaban, 3. apixaban, and 4. edoxaban.[42] - In patients with remarkable dyspepsia or any past medical history suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding, VKA, and apixaban are the preferred treatments. It should be noted that DOCAs, eg, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors, eg, rivaroxaban, and selective factor Xa inhibitors, eg, edoxaban, might be associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal bleeding.[43][44][45] - In the group of patients with a history compatible with poor compliance, VKA is preferred. However, it should be noted that some patients might still be highly compliant with other alternatives, including DOACs.[46] - If thrombolytic therapy is indicated, unfractionated heparin is indicated.[47] - In patients who might later be subjected to reversal of thrombolytic therapy, it should be noted that reversal agents for DOACs are not universally available. - Since most anticoagulants have the potential to cross the placenta, the preferred anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy is LMWH.
