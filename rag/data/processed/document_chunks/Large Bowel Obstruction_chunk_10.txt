has been found to support the practice.[5][34] Stenting can be deployed from a colonoscope under fluoroscopy following the placement of a guidewire, and many stents have markers to help with positioning. Post-stenting protocol includes a plain radiograph to assess for free air and stent placement.[35] **Stenting risks** Risks of stenting include perforation and possible dissemination of malignancy. A Japanese study involving 202 patients with colonic obstruction used a low axial force self-expanding metal stent. Study markers included the technical success of stent placement and the clinical alleviation of the obstruction, which were reported to be 97.5% and 97%, respectively, with no perforations noted in this cohort.[36] Some experts have voiced concern that stenting is associated with increased perineural invasion of malignant cells and questioned whether the observed invasion is secondary to the biology of the lesion or induced by the stenting. A study found stenting to be an independent risk factor for perineural invasion unrelated to the time interval from stenting to surgery. The study authors correlated this finding with the severity of the obstruction rather than the stenting, positing that the pathophysiology of the severe obstruction resulted in increased pressure, leading to local invasion. A meta-analysis found higher perineural and lymphatic invasion following stenting, decreasing overall survival.[37] Another meta-analysis found higher recurrence rates when stenting was used instead of an emergent stoma, with a lower 90-day mortality in the colostomy group versus those undergoing an emergent colectomy or stenting as a bridge to surgery. Higher costs in the stent group were identified, and more eventual anastomoses were found in the stoma group.[38] Current recommendations for treating a malignant obstruction following stenting include 2 cycles of chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin before operative intervention to address any theoretical risk for cancer dissemination.[6] **Alternative Interventions to Stenting** In addition to stenting, other options can bridge to surgery or provide palliative treatment for colonic obstruction. One such alternative is endoscopic dilation of the obstruction. Although stenting is more effective for malignancies and post-radiation strictures, balloon dilation is indicated for anastomotic or inflammatory strictures and often requires multiple dilations. The balloon catheter is positioned over a guidewire, inflated with saline, and then deflated and removed. The balloon size must be compatible with the lumen to minimize the risk of perforation. Dilation under fluoroscopic guidance is possible when available and involves the injection of dilute contrast into saline. Successful resolution of obstruction has
