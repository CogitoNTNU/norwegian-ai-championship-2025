AAT can resemble those of presbycusis. However, presbycusis typically presents with greater hearing loss at 8 kHz than at 3, 4, or 6 kHz. In contrast, AAT often shows more significant loss at 6 kHz than 8 kHz, with similar thresholds at 4 and 8 kHz, and peak loss sometimes occurring at 3 kHz.[49][50] A study of 24 young military personnel conducted follow-up audiometry at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 15 days after AAT caused by firearm discharge, confirming that mid-to-high frequency loss is characteristic of AAT. Notches at 3 and 4 kHz were present in 71% of patients, with losses ranging from 10 to 70 dB. Hearing improved over time, with an average loss of 24 ± 16 dB at 24 hours, 14 ± 13 dB at 72 hours, and 12 ± 14 dB by day 15.[51] Pure-tone audiometry was performed on 361 Finnish conscripts who experienced AAT during military service. Over 75% of affected ears showed hearing loss in the high-frequency range (above 2 kHz), while the speech frequency range was impacted in the remaining 25%.[52] Perez et al evaluated 143 patients exposed to explosions, finding that 46% of audiograms exhibited a downsloping pattern above 2 kHz, 41% showed a mid-frequency notch, and 12% had a flat configuration.[53] Pure-tone audiometry is subjective; obtaining acoustic reflex thresholds is essential to identify potential malingering in patients. **Otoacoustic Emissions** Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are a valuable tool for hearing screening after AAT, especially in cases where a patient may be feigning hearing loss. OAEs assess the peripheral auditory system, including the outer and middle ears, and the cochlea. OAEs are reliable and reproducible, providing important clinical insights, particularly when patients do not respond truthfully during pure-tone audiometry following a blast explosion. OAEs are sounds generated by the movement of outer hair cells in a properly functioning cochlea when stimulated by external sounds. This objective, sensitive, and user-friendly test involves an aural probe with a speaker that delivers an acoustic stimulus while a microphone detects the resulting emissions. Distortion product OAEs can identify early NIHL with 82% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity, even when pure-tone audiometry results are normal.[54] However, there is a risk of false positives associated with this test.[55] OAEs can assess auditory function following AAT. The connection between noise exposure and OAEs is well-documented, emphasizing their utility as sensitive indicators of hearing loss, particularly after AAT. Numerous studies have shown a
