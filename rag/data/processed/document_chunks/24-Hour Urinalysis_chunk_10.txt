for females. A lower-than-expected creatinine excretion value typically indicates an incomplete collection. Creatinine clearance, described in the next section, provides further insights into kidney function. ## Clinical Significance **Measurement of Renal Function (Creatinine Clearance)** Numerous formulas are available to estimate renal function, with most relying on creatinine levels. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, CKD-EPI equation, is currently the most commonly used formula in laboratories and hospitals. This formula estimates the GFR using creatinine levels and sex as critical variables.[23] The gold standard for GFR is injecting inulin and measuring kidney clearance.[24] However, this method is invasive, time-consuming, and unavailable in all laboratories. As an alternative, the biochemical marker creatinine in serum and urine is commonly used to estimate GFR.[25] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Renal Function Tests](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28359)," for further information. Creatinine is the anhydride product of creatinine and is directly related to muscle mass.[10] Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma cleared of creatinine per unit time and provides a rapid, cost-effective method for assessing renal function. CrCl and GFR can be estimated using urine creatinine, serum creatinine, and urine volume collected over a specific period. However, because the peritubular capillaries secrete creatinine, CrCl tends to overestimate GFR by about 10% to 20%. Despite this margin of error, CrCl remains an accepted method for measuring GFR due to its ease of measurement.[26] CrCl is calculated using the equation: - CrCl= (UCr × V) / PCr CrCl = creatinine clearance; UCr= urinary creatinine concentration (mg/dL); V= urinary flow rate (volume/time in mL/min); and PCr= plasma creatinine concentration (mg/dL). Urea clearance, similar to creatinine clearance, is used to estimate renal function: - Clur= (Uur × V) / Pur Clur= urea clearance; Uur= urinary urea concentration (mg/dL); V= urinary flow rate (volume/time in mL/min); and Pur= plasma urea concentration (mg/dL).

Accurate collections can identify treatable abnormalities predisposing individuals to stone formation and help monitor treatment effectiveness. Since urinary constituents can vary significantly based on diet and lifestyle, their interpretation can be complex and often subjective. More than 90% of patients with kidney stones will exhibit at least 1 suboptimal chemical disorder. While 24-hour urine testing alone does not cure nephrolithiasis, it helps guide effective prophylactic treatment for patients committed to adhering
