with advanced maternal age, Black race, and multifetal pregnancies. If wall motion abnormalities are present, anticoagulation is essential due to the hypercoagulable state caused by pregnancy. Recovery is variable by global region and inversely correlates with lowered EF.[14] **Obesity** Obesity\*\*\*\* is a leading cause of CHF in patients younger than 40 years, according to the "Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity" (the CHARM study). The "obesity paradox" described elsewhere has significant study flaws and is derived from older data. Up to 10% of CHF cases are thought to be attributable to obesity alone. Patients with obesity are more likely to have HFpEF, possibly secondary to adipose-produced cytokines, eg, IL-1b, IL-8, and TNFÎ±. Adipose tissue also degrades natriuretic peptides.[15][16][17] **Tachycardia and arrhythmia** Tachycardia and arrhythmia can induce a low-output CHF state. Dilation of all cardiac chambers and preservation or thinning of biventricular wall thickness is usually noted. Electrophysiologic changes accompany this, including prolonged duration and decreased amplitude of action potentials in the myocytes. All of these factors induce the typical neurohormonal response causing CHF. With rate control, these changes are often reversible due to myocardial hibernation.[18] **Thyrotoxicosis** Thyrotoxicosis is a rare cause of HF despite initiating a hyperdynamic circulatory state. This may be partially due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, causing sodium and water retention, as well as upregulation of erythropoietin-stimulating agent, both of which will cause increased blood volume. Sustained tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation can also cause CHF.[19] **High-output cardiac failure** High-output cardiac failure can be associated with thiamine deficiency, which is a rare condition found primarily among patients who are elderly, homeless, or have alcohol abuse disorder. Thiamine deficiency causes decreased ATP production with an accumulation of adenosine, which causes systemic vasodilation. This leads to lowered systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. This evolves to weakened myocardium and decreased EF. Diuretic use can also cause urinary thiamine loss, further compounding the situation.[20][21] Other common causes of high-output cardiac failure are obesity, liver disease, and arteriovenous shunts. The causative physiologic changes are decreased afterload (ie, systemic vascular resistance) and increased metabolism. These can often present with preserved EF, pulmonary congestion, increased filling pressures, and elevated natriuretic peptides.[22][23] ## Epidemiology The global magnitude of the disease cannot be accurately assessed given the significant differences in geographical distribution, assessment methods, lack of imaging modalities, and nonadherence to the uniform staging and diagnosis of
