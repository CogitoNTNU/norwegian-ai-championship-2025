either clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromesâ€” acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and stroke.[9][10] **Anticoagulants** - reduce mortality by decreasing re-infarction rates in combination with antiplatelet agents. Used intravenously for acute treatment.[9] **Anatomic assessment of coronary arteries/consideration of revascularization** - high-risk patients should be identified with risk stratification methods and considered for urgent revascularization.[9] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of angina can divide into body systems: - Gastrointestinal: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, peptic ulcer disease - Pulmonary: pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism - Musculoskeletal: costochondritis, rib injury, muscle spasm, chest wall injury - Psychiatric: panic attack, generalized anxiety - Cardiac non-ischemic: pericarditis, myocarditis - Vascular: aortic dissection ## Prognosis The prognosis of chronic stable angina progression to cardiac events varies among patients. Factors affecting prognosis include cardiovascular comorbidities as well as compliance with lifestyle modifications and medical treatment plans. Long-term prognosis is also affected by left ventricular systolic function, the degree of exercise the patient can tolerate, and the extent of CAD present.[1] Risk factors for poorer prognosis are diabetes mellitus, previous MI, hypertension, increasing age, and male sex.[11] The use of nitrates has also been demonstrated to be a negative prognostic indicator of mortality, likely because their use indicates more advanced disease. ## Complications As the initial symptom of CAD in many cases, the main complication of angina is a future cardiac event, such as myocardial infarction. In one study, estimates are that the 10-year risk of MI exceeded 10 percent in women with chronic stable angina starting from when they initially began to use nitrates to treat symptoms.[12] Aside from this potentially fatal complication, chronic stable angina has implications for society as well as patients. These include lower quality of life due to decreased ability to perform daily activities, as well as an increased burden to society from indirect costs, such as early retirement or disability.[1] Angina treatment should be aimed not only at improving mortality but also at treating symptoms so patients can be more active.[13] ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients with cardiac risk factors should be monitored for symptoms of angina and receive education about alarming signs, such as symptoms occurring at rest and symptoms no longer relieved by nitrates. It is imperative to stress risk factor modification as an essential component of treatment to slow progression. So, dietary and exercise education, along with smoking
