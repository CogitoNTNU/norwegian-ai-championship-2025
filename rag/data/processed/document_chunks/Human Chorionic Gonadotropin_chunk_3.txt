hCG levels are reported in milli-international units of hCG hormone per milliliter of blood (mIU/mL). International units per liter (IU/L) may also be used. Serum assays are highly sensitive and can detect beta-hCG levels as low as 1 to 2 mIU/mL. Urine hCG testing can also be qualitative, reporting a positive or negative result. The assays detect hCG levels typically starting at 20 to 50 mIU/mL, reportedly as low as 6.3 to 12.5 mIU/mL, corresponding to levels approximately 4 weeks post-conception.[20] ## Clinical Significance hCG holds significant clinical value in both reproductive and oncologic medicine. The levels of hCG can provide critical insights into early pregnancy, pregnancy viability, and certain hormone-secreting tumors. **Pregnancy** hCG is a key hormone in pregnancy, and its clinical utility is primarily centered around its detection in early pregnancy, along with serial measurement during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications. hCG levels can vary widely among women with normal pregnancies. Typically, serum and urine concentrations of hCG rise exponentially during the first trimester of pregnancy, doubling approximately every 24 hours for the first 8 weeks. The peak typically occurs around 10 weeks of gestation, after which levels decrease until approximately week 16, where they remain relatively constant until term.[4] Patients whose hCG levels plateau before 8 weeks of gestation or fail to double commonly have a nonviable pregnancy, whether intrauterine or extrauterine. Extrauterine (ectopic) pregnancies typically exhibit a low rate of rise without the expected doubling. However, given the wide range of normal hCG levels and the variability in its rate of rise, serum hCG testing is often combined with ultrasound evaluation to improve sensitivity and specificity.[21] A threshold of 5000 IU/L has been associated with the need for surgical intervention (>5000 IU/L) versus successful medical intervention (\<5000 IU/L).[22][23] In addition, there has been recent discussion that elevated beta-hCG levels in the second trimester may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and should prompt further investigation.[24] The return of hCG to zero following delivery or termination of pregnancy typically takes between 7 and 60 days.[25] Monitoring the decline in hCG levels is crucial in terminating molar pregnancies and also following the termination of normal or ectopic pregnancies to assure that the therapy has been successful. Notably, many different combinations of antibodies are used in commercial assays. This variety yields heterogeneous results, with a 50-fold difference in immunoassay results.[4] This potential disparity is clinically relevant, particularly when comparing results
