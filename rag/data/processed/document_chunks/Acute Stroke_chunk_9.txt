harm.[39] Anticoagulation should be discontinued immediately in patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH, and rapid reversal should be performed as soon as possible.[39][52] Platelet transfusion may be considered in patients treated with aspirin who require emergency neurosurgery.[39][53] However, platelet transfusion should not be administered for patients treated with aspirin who do not require emergency neurosurgery due to potentially harmful effects.[39][54] Surgical management has reduced mortality for specific patients compared to medical management alone. Surgical options for managing ICH include minimally invasive hematoma evacuation with endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration, external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion, and craniotomy.[39] **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage** According to the latest guidelines from the European Stroke Organization (ESO) and AHA/ASA, early treatment of aneurysms is recommended to decrease the risk of rebleeding. The ESO recommends intervention within 72 hours after symptom onset.[50][55] However, a recent meta-analysis on the timing of endovascular treatment in SAH indicates a lack of evidence regarding the optimal timing in SAH patients.[56] Short-term antifibrinolytic therapy was considered a strategy to reduce the rebleeding risk; however, the routine use of tranexamic acid after SAH cannot be recommended.[57] Between the onset of SAH symptoms and the obliteration of the aneurysm, AHA/ASA recommends maintaining SBP below 160 mm Hg. On the contrary, ESO suggests maintaining the SBP below 180 mm Hg until the ruptured aneurysm has been coiled or clipped.[34][50][55] Complete obliteration of the aneurysm is the recommended goal, with endovascular coiling being the preferred treatment when a ruptured aneurysm is considered suitable for either coiling or clipping.[34][50][55] In case of a patient experiencing a seizure associated with SAH, treatment with antiepileptic drugs is recommended.[55] Short-term seizure prophylaxis may also be considered during the immediate posthemorrhagic period.[50] Depending on the clinical situation, the management of hydrocephalus involves diverting cerebrospinal fluid through methods such as EVD or lumbar drainage.[34][50][55] Nimodipine should be administered to all patients to prevent DCI, with oral administration preferred over IV administration.[34][50][55] Additional treatment goals include pain control, euvolemia, normothermia, and normoglycemia. ## Differential Diagnosis The systematic review of the differential diagnosis of suspected stroke includes a table listing the 20 most common differential diagnoses. These 20 diagnoses collectively account for nearly 100% of patients with suspected stroke who were not diagnosed with a confirmed transient ischemic attack or stroke. Arranged in the order of frequency, the top 5 non-stroke diagnoses are seizure (19.6%), syncope (12.2%), sepsis (9.6%), benign headache disorder (9%), and brain tumor (8.2%).[58] ## Prognosis
