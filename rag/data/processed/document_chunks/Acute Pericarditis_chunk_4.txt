pericardial compliance allows the sac to dilate over time in response to slowly accumulating fluid, preventing compression of the cardiac chambers.[2] Consequently, the rate of fluid accumulation—and the resulting pressure changes—often has a greater impact than the volume in determining the hemodynamic effects on the heart. As a result, a relatively small pericardial effusion can lead to life-threatening tamponade if it accumulates rapidly, while a gradual process, such as malignancy, may allow a large pericardial effusion to develop over weeks before causing constrictive physiology in the cardiac chambers.[24] ## History and Physical Pericarditis is classified based on duration. Acute pericarditis lasts less than 4 to 6 weeks, incessant pericarditis persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks but resolves within 3 months, and chronic pericarditis extends beyond 3 months. Recurrent pericarditis refers to a new episode that occurs following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks between episodes.[23] Acute pericarditis accounts for approximately 5% of non-ischemic chest pain presentations in emergency departments and 0.1% of inpatient admissions.[23] The classical presentation involves central, severe chest pain that is pleuritic (which worsens with deep inspiration) and positional (which improves with sitting up and leaning forward). The pain may radiate to the trapezius ridges if the phrenic nerve is inflamed as it passes through the pericardium.[23][25] When myocarditis is also present, the pain may be less specific, with symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, potentially accompanying the presentation.[26] Pericardial pain can be distinguished from ischemic pain, which typically worsens with exertion or emotional stress and improves with rest or nitroglycerin. Ischemic pain is generally non-positional, non-pleuritic, and non-reproducible with palpation. However, atypical presentations of ischemic pain are common, making clinical differentiation challenging.[27] Pleuritic chest pain that does not improve with sitting up and is accompanied by respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sputum production, is more likely secondary to pulmonary disease. In contrast, lower chest pain that improves with leaning forward, is non-pleuritic, and occurs alongside food intake should raise suspicion for abdominal conditions, such as esophagitis or acute pancreatitis. ## Evaluation The differential diagnosis for chest pain should include angina due to stable ischemic heart disease or acute coronary syndrome, subendocardial ischemia associated with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, myocarditis, pleurisy secondary to pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, costochondritis, esophageal spasm, peptic ulcer disease, or referred pain from another organ, such as acute cholecystitis.
