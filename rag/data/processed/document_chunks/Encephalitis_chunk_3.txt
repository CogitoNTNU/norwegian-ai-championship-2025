acid in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens or _Naegleria fowleri_ antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens. To establish the diagnosis of GAE, brain tissue demonstrating trophozoites and cysts is needed. Moderate granulomatous inflammation with prominent vascular involvement is typically present on brain biopsy. CSF parameters show mild pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low or normal glucose concentration. Rarely,_Acanthamoeba_ trophozoites may be seen on the Giemsa stain of the CSF sediment. Head computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should precede lumbar puncture if clinical signs of focal central nervous system involvement or elevated intracranial pressure are present. MRI of the brain shows the presence of single or multiple space-occupying lesions with ring enhancement. Computed tomography may show progressive hydrocephalus, meningeal thickening, pseudotumoral lesions, largely isolated lesions, or multifocal ring-enhancing lesions. On post-mortem examination, significant edema and hemorrhage of the brain are seen.[12][13][14] ## Treatment / Management Due to the rarity of the disease and lack of clinical trials, the definitive treatment for GAE is not clear at this time. A combination of drugs is used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend combination treatment with pentamidine, sulfadiazine, flucytosine, and either fluconazole or itraconazole. Multiple other regimens are also recommended. Chronic Acanthamoeba meningitis was successfully treated in 2 children with a combination of oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and ketoconazole. Resection of brain lesions may help as well.[12][13][14] Similarly, the optimal treatment of PAM is unknown; reports range from 9 to 30 days. For the treatment of PAM amphotericin B, both intravenously and intrathecally is recommended, but considering the fulminant course of the disease and high mortality rates, a combination of drugs is generally used. Reports include the use of amphotericin in addition to rifampin, fluconazole, miltefosine, and azithromycin. Posaconazole has also been shown to be effective in mouse models of disease. It may replace fluconazole as the azole of choice, although further studies are warranted to confirm this choice.[12][13][14] Only one case of GAE due to _Sappinia_ has been reported in humans (attributed to _S diploidea_).[15] The patient was a previously healthy male farmer who engaged in handling livestock. The disease manifested as headache, vomiting, blurry vision, and loss of consciousness following a sinus infection. Histopathology of a single 2 cm focal lesion in the posterior left temporal lobe demonstrated trophozoites (40 to 60 microns in diameter) with two nuclei. The infection was likely acquired by
