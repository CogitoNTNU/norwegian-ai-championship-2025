methotrexate, as there may be decreased efficacy due to adverse interactions with the drug. Methotrexate may increase immunosuppression when paired with other medications, among other potential adverse effects. Patients undergoing surgical interventions must adhere to the surgeon's recommendations to limit the risk of infection and other postoperative complications. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of ectopic pregnancy requires a well-coordinated, interprofessional approach to ensure accurate diagnosis, timely treatment, and optimal patient outcomes. When a woman presents to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, the healthcare team—including nurses, emergency physicians, obstetricians, advanced practitioners, and pharmacists—must work collectively to provide efficient, patient-centered care. Nurses play a critical role in the initial assessment by recognizing key symptoms and ensuring prompt evaluation by a physician. It is the responsibility of the clinician to consider ectopic pregnancy in any sexually active woman of childbearing age presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. Evidence-based tools can enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary testing or delays in care. By incorporating standardized protocols and leveraging clinical decision-making models, healthcare teams can improve efficiency and enhance patient safety. Interprofessional communication is essential in the management of ectopic pregnancy, particularly when consulting specialists such as obstetricians, radiologists, and pharmacists. Emergency physicians and obstetricians must collaborate closely to confirm the diagnosis, determine the appropriate management plan, and discuss treatment options with the patient. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the safe administration of methotrexate when medical management is appropriate, providing education on potential adverse effects, and monitoring requirements. Nurses are responsible for patient education, emotional support, and posttreatment follow-up, reinforcing adherence to care plans and recognizing potential complications. By fostering teamwork, clear communication, and adherence to established protocols, healthcare professionals can enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure the highest patient safety standards in managing ectopic pregnancy. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27633&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27633) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/ectopic-pregnancy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27633) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27633/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27633) [![Ectopic Pregnancy](/books/NBK539860/bin/A__-__pos__FAST__ectopic.gif)](/books/NBK539860/figure/article-27633.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK539860/figure/article-27633.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Ectopic Pregnancy.
