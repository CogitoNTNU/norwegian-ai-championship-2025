personal protective equipment and safe handling of biological specimens. Maintaining a safe and compliant laboratory environment helps ensure consistent performance while minimizing risks of errors or exposure.[42] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes All clinicians caring for patients with diabetes mellitus need a thorough understanding of HbA1c and its clinical significance. In general, HbA1c reflects the average glucose concentration over 3 months. HbA1c is often used as an outcome measure to determine whether an intervention in a population is successful by demonstrating a decrease in HbA1c by a specific percentage. There is a movement within the medical community to shift away from using HbA1c as an exclusive standard of care test to assess patient response to treatment. The newest proposed methods include the estimated average glucose and the glucose time in range.[43] These methods use data obtained from continuous glucose monitors that record blood glucose levels around the clock. In addition, these methods can offer healthcare professionals a more accurate picture of the blood sugar average and fluctuations. However, these methods are not available to all patients on a widespread basis. According to ADA guidelines, HbA1c levels should be measured 2 times annually in stable patients and at least 4 times in patients with glucose fluctuations or those who have changed their diabetes treatment. HbA1c is one of the preferred diabetes diagnostic tests today. The blood draw can occur anytime, and no special handling requirements exist. However, to ensure that the A1c value is correct, clinicians must be aware of the causes of false-positive and false-negative results. As many patients with diabetes mellitus are treated in outpatient settings, diabetes care nurses must understand HbA1c results and know when to refer patients to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Pharmacists must also fully understand and interpret this test, as they are involved in glycemic management, medication, agent selection, dosing, and monitoring. The nurse and pharmacist must inform the treating clinician regarding any changes in HbA1c and verify patient medication compliance. HbA1c is a valuable tool for managing diabetes mellitus and other glycemic control disorders, but its effectiveness is maximized within an interprofessional healthcare team environment. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22729&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22729) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22729/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22729) ## References 1.
