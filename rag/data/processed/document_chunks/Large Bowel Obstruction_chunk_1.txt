prompt resuscitation and diagnosis to limit morbidity and improve outcomes.[1][2][3] In some cases, an obstruction is the first clinical sign of colorectal carcinoma, particularly left-sided carcinoma, and up to 25% of colorectal carcinomas present as large bowel obstruction.[4][5] A reported 8% to 13% of colorectal cancer cases are obstructed at the time of diagnosis. A majority of emergency admissions for colorectal cancer are due to large bowel obstruction.[6] The incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing in young adults, often presenting as acute obstruction.[5] ## Etiology The majority of large bowel obstruction arises from neoplastic, neurogenic, inflammatory, and mechanical causes within the colon. However, large bowel obstruction is also caused by extrinsic factors, such as compression from a space-occupying tumor, carcinomatosis, or fibroproliferative process within the peritoneal or retroperitoneal cavities. The most common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults is underlying colorectal cancer. A colonic malignancy may also present in the form of colonic intussusception, and other lesions, including polyps, lymphomas, lipomas, and stool impaction, may also cause intussusception. Approximately 40% of colorectal cancers cause clinical emergencies, and large bowel obstruction is the most common emergent presentation.[7][8] Benign intrinsic causes of large bowel obstruction include inflammatory processes, foreign body or food blockages, and volvulus, particularly of the sigmoid colon. Inflammation and strictures caused by conditions such as diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, anastomotic narrowing, ischemic colitis, radiation, tuberculosis, and trauma can result in obstruction.[8] Food impaction is more common in older adults, and drug packs and other foreign bodies may cause obstruction or perforation. In rare cases, the sigmoid colon can become incarcerated within a hernia, most commonly within the left inguinal area. External compression causing obstruction occurs secondary to gynecologic neoplasms, carcinomatosis, and lymphadenopathy from a variety of malignancies and inflammatory processes such as pancreatitis.[9][10] Endometriosis can cause colonic obstruction either intrinsically or extrinsically. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a less common cause of obstruction, characterized by inflammation and deposition of fibrotic tissue, particularly around vascular structures. This condition may result from a systemic, regional, or local response to atherosclerosis due to prior or current infection, malignancy, medication, or radiation. Rare occurrences include congenital bands, migration of medically implanted devices, such as intrauterine devices, and gallstones.[8][11][12] A case study documented an acute colonic obstruction secondary to a pharmacobezoar composed of multivitamins, exacerbated by chronic constipation, redundant sigmoid colon, and dementia.[13] Pseudo-obstruction, a dysfunction of colonic innervation, can stem from multiple etiologies, including
