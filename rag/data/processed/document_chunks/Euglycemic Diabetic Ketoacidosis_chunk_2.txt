glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine elevations, worsening lipolysis and ketogenesis. Additionally, decreased gluconeogenesis by the liver occurs in fasting where hepatic glycogen is already depleted, or increased glucosuria by the kidneys contributes to EDKA.[3] Often, insulin-using patients do not recognize their symptoms as DKA because serum glucose is not elevated, and they may maintain or decrease their insulin dose.[1] If insulin dosing is adequate for glucose levels, it prevents gluconeogenesis, resulting in euglycemia. EDKA can be considered a “partially treated DKA” in this setting.[9] SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) are a newer class of antidiabetic drugs that increase the risk of EDKA unrelated to the duration of exposure.[16][18][19] The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in T1DM is not recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is discouraged because the risk of ketone-associated effects can be as high as 9%.[1][20][21] The risk of EDKA among T2DM patients on SGLT2 inhibitors may be higher in patients with beta-cell insufficiency and perhaps predict those at greater risk for evolving to T1DM.[20] The mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is to enhance excretion and block reabsorption of filtered glucose from the proximal convoluted tubule.[22] The loss of urinary glucose again creates a state of carbohydrate starvation and volume depletion, increasing the glucagon/insulin ratio and resulting in severe dehydration and ketosis.[1] Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to directly stimulate the release of glucagon from the pancreas, further worsening the glucagon/insulin imbalance and suppressing the removal of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate by the kidneys.[22][23][24] Euglycemia is maintained due to the loss of urinary glucose [2][9][10][25][26] and SGLT2 inhibitor-triggered hypoinsulinemia.[27] SGLT2 inhibitors also increase ketone reabsorption, such that ketosis is common in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors after a trigger such as pregnancy, alcohol, surgery, infection, or starvation.[9][18] Pregnancy is a risk factor for EDKA because of the physiologic state of hypoinsulinemia and increased starvation. Increased levels of cortisol and placental lactogen result in insulin resistance, and episodes of vomiting or fasting can lead to exaggerated starvation ketosis.[28] Respiratory alkalosis leading to bicarbonate loss in the urine exacerbates the acidosis.[29] These factors, taken together, can result in starvation, euglycemia, and ketoacidosis by the previous mechanisms described.[2] Alcoholic ketoacidosis may have a similar presentation to EDKA, with anorexia, vomiting, dyspnea, and significant anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonemia. Some consider alcoholic ketoacidosis a subtype of EDKA, and both are associated with increased glucagon/insulin ratio.[1][9][15] The differentiating factors are that
