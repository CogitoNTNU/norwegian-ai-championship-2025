of inhaled induction for children at risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events. Guidelines also recommend cuffed endotracheal tubes and less invasive airway devices such as mask ventilation or a supraglottic airway when possible.[18] Noninvasive airway management, such as supraglottic airway placement, is associated with a decreased risk of postoperative hypoxemia and coughing compared to endotracheal tube use in adults.[[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537327/#article-17923.r14) When comparing the supraglottic airway to an endotracheal tube for airway control in children, the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events was lower with the supraglottic airway. However, there was no statistically significant difference in bronchospasm or aspiration between the 2 groups. Propofol is a suitable induction agent that avoids volatile agents. Ketamine is suitable for the hemodynamically unstable pediatric patient. For children with poorly controlled asthma, delaying surgery for improved asthma management is ideal. If unable to postpone, experts recommend bronchodilators and steroids before and after surgery. IV magnesium and continuous ß2-agonist therapy may be necessary. Aminophylline is not a recommended treatment option, and antibiotics are not required for asthma exacerbations unless a known bacterial cause exists.[[19]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_34890494)[[20]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_28546381)[[21]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_34514673) Neuromuscular-blocking drugs (NMBDs) improve conditions during intubation by minimizing airway resistance. Clinicians often avoid depolarizing NMBDs in children, given the risk of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible undiagnosed myopathy. The use of topical and inhaled lidocaine applied to prevent airway irritation and bronchoconstriction before endotracheal intubation is controversial, as evidence suggests an increased incidence of desaturation using this technique.[[16]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537327/#article-17923.r16)[[22]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_22211867) If heart rate or blood pressure control is necessary in acute settings, cardioselective β-blockers such as esmolol and metoprolol are safer options for patients with asthma.[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537327/#article-17923.r13) Before patients emerge from general anesthesia, anesthesia providers reverse neuromuscular blockade. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine must be used cautiously, as these drugs can increase bronchoconstriction by inhibiting acetylcholine breakdown. Alternatively, sugammadex, which directly binds to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers such as rocuronium and vecuronium, may be preferred as it does not increase the risk of bronchospasm. Although deep extubation theoretically reduces the risk of bronchospasm from the ETT, current research offers limited support for this benefit; a recent randomized controlled trial found no significant difference between awake and deep extubation regarding perioperative respiratory adverse events.[[23]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=174406#ref_33121440) ## Other Issues All that wheezes is not asthma. When caring for an anesthetized patient with asthma, bronchospasm is likely to be at the top of the list of differential diagnoses for an episode of wheezing. However, the following
