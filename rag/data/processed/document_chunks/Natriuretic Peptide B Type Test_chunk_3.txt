BNP production in cardiomyocytes is significantly increased by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta, an effect that is markedly increased when fibroblasts are present; inflammatory cytokines directly stimulate BNP production in the heart independent of hemodynamics.[27] This phenomenon is not seen with ANP. In clinical practice, plasma BNP levels will be higher in patients with myocarditis than expected solely from the hemodynamics.[28] ## Specimen Requirements and Procedure The b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is labile and must be collected into tubes containing EDTA and tested ideally within four hours of collection. Serum samples and citrated or heparinized plasma cannot be used. BNP can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2^oC to 8^oC for some assays.[29] BNP is degraded by contact activation of the blood coagulation system and can be stabilized by storage under frozen conditions or by adding kallikrein protease inhibitors.[30] In contrast, NT-proBNP is much more stable than BNP and can be kept at refrigerated temperatures for three days. NT-proBNP can be tested in serum and plasma collected in either heparin or EDTA. When EDTA plasma is used, NT-proBNP concentration is about 10% lower than for serum or lithium heparin.[31] ## Testing Procedures Both BNP and NT-proBNP levels can be tested through standard blood draws. There are also point-of-care BNP assays, which take approximately fifteen minutes for results and are often helpful in emergent settings.[32] BNP and NT-proBNP are determined by several different immunoassays using antibodies directed to different epitopes on the antigen molecules.[33] Before introduction into clinical practice, BNP and NT-proBNP assays must be characterized with respect to the following pre-analytical and analytical issues:[34] **Pre-Analytical** a. Effect of storage time and temperatureb. Influence of different anticoagulantsc. Influence of gel separator tubesd. Plastic blood collection tubes are necessary for BNP; for NT-proBNP, either glass or plastic is acceptable **Analytical** a. Identification of both antibody recognition epitopesb. Cross-reactivity characteristics with related natriuretic peptides, including NT-pro ANP, ANP, CNP, BNP, and glycosylated and nonglycosylated NTproBNP and proBNPc. Identification of interferences from heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors, and human antimouse antibodiesd.

Clarification of dilution responses ## Interfering Factors BNP and NT-proBNP levels may be affected by specific comorbidities, such as chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[23] Levels are higher in patients with renal failure, diabetes, and ACS and lower in patients
