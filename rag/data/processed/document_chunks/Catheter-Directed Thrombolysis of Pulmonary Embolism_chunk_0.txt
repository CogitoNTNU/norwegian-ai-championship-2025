An estimated 10 million individuals experience VTE annually, resulting in over 500,000 fatalities in Europe and a range of 100,000 to 300,000 deaths in the United States. Pulmonary embolism, as the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality behind heart attack and stroke, presents a complex treatment challenge. While systemic thrombolytic therapy remains part of the pulmonary embolism management arsenal, its effectiveness and safety, particularly for the growing intermediate-risk group, remain debated. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has emerged as a potential paradigm shift in the therapeutic landscape of pulmonary embolism. This minimally invasive technique, delivering thrombolytic agents directly to the clot via catheterization, promises targeted therapy with potentially reduced systemic bleeding risks. This activity on CDT for pulmonary embolism is crucial for healthcare professionals involved in pulmonary embolism management. This activity delves into the science and evidence behind CDT, examining its effectiveness, safety, and potential benefits for different patient groups. Participants will gain insights into CDT implementation's technical considerations and possible limitations, identifying knowledge gaps and outlining future research directions. Key endpoints like mortality, hemodynamic improvement, and bleeding risks will be scrutinized within this specific context. By staying informed about the latest advancements and best practices in CDT, healthcare professionals can enhance their knowledge and skills, ultimately improving patient outcomes in managing pulmonary embolism. **Objectives:** - Identify appropriate candidates for catheter-directed thrombolysis in acute pulmonary embolism management based on clinical presentation, risk factors, and imaging findings. - Apply evidence-based guidelines and protocols for catheter-directed thrombolysis administration, dosage, and monitoring in managing acute pulmonary embolism. - Select appropriate catheterization techniques and thrombolytic agents based on patient characteristics and clot location for catheter-directed thrombolysis. - Collaborate with interventional radiologists and cardiologists to optimize catheter-directed thrombolysis procedures and outcomes in acute pulmonary embolism management.
