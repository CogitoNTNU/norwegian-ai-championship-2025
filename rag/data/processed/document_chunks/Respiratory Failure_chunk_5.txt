to areas of the lung that are not anatomically or physiologically able to exchange gas. Tachypnea can contribute to high CO2 by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/Vt). High alveolar VA and the associated ventilation-perfusion mismatch are considered one of the main mechanisms for developing hypercapnia in individuals with COPD.[15] **Increased CO production:** CO2 is a by-product of oxidative metabolism, and high CO2 production may occur due to fever, exercise, hyperalimentation, sepsis, and thyrotoxicosis. High CO2 production becomes pathologic if the compensatory increase in minute ventilation mechanism fails.[16] **Alveolar hypoventilation: A** lveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure.[8] (as discussed later in this section under Type 2 respiratory failure). ## History and Physical Respiratory failure is a syndrome with a myriad of etiologies; therefore, a thorough history and physical examination are required to narrow the differential diagnosis. **History** Patients typically present with respiratory symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, and wheezing); however, symptoms from other organ systems (ie, chest pain, decreased appetite, heartburn, fever, and significant weight loss) are important. Loss of smell and/or exposure to sick people or unprotect contact with individuals with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is essential in suspecting COVID-19 illness and associated respiratory failure, particularly in high-risk patients (older patients, men, and morbidly obese).[17] For a specific population, the presence of immunocompromised conditions or taking immunosuppressants is also essential in risk-stratifying patients at risk for respiratory failure early on. For patients already diagnosed with airway disease, it is important to assess inhaler compliance and technique, recent steroid use, as well as exposure to environmental triggers. For patients with hypertension and chronic cough, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be investigated. Social history is also crucial when considering respiratory failure. Alcohol use and sexually transmitted diseases may lead to an immunocompromised state, making patients more susceptible to certain infections, while a sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism. Habits such as having birds and hobbies such as diving and flying may have implications when considering etiologies of respiratory failure. Most importantly, a patient's tobacco smoking history should be investigated, including exposure to second-hand smoke, marijuana smoking, smoking e-cigarettes, and vaping.[18] Finally, an occupational history may be helpful when considering work-related lung disease (i.e., hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pneumoconiosis), while a family history may be beneficial when considering atopic, genetic (ie, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis), and
