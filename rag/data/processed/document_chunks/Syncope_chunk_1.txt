of consciousness stems from a problem in the heart that prevents it from supplying enough nutrients and oxygen to the brain. This cardiac problem may be a rhythm disturbance, a structural problem, or a structural problem that predisposes a patient to a rhythm disturbance. Cardiac syncope is estimated to be the cause of syncope in 15% of syncopal events.[3] Distinguishing cardiac syncope from the myriad of other syncopal etiologies can be challenging. For this reason, it is imperative for all healthcare providers to have a general understanding of cardiac syncope and how to recognize it.[4][5] ## Etiology Syncope is caused by a temporary global failure of cerebral perfusion. When cardiac, the brain is not perfused because the heart is failing to generate enough cardiac output to send its freshly oxygenated blood to the brain. This is typically secondary to either a mechanical or structural cardiac defect or an arrhythmia that alters electrical conduction through the myocardium. Arrhythmias are recognized as the more common mechanism of the two. However, structural and mechanical abnormalities in the heart will often induce such arrhythmias. These processes are therefore often interrelated. The following is a brief list of the more common etiologies of cardiac syncope. Further discussion regarding how to recognize and manage these etiologies will follow. **Structural** - Ischemic cardiomyopathy (most common structural cardiac etiology of syncope) - Valvular abnormalities (second most common structural etiology, most commonly aortic stenosis) - Nonischemic/Dilated cardiomyopathy (third most common structural etiology) - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy - Aortic dissection - Cardiac tamponade - Obstructive cardiac tumors - Pericardial disease - Pulmonary hypertension - Pulmonary emboli - Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy[5][3] **Electrical** - Tachyarrhythmia - Supraventricular (examples: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), PSVT in the setting of pre-existing accessory conduction pathways) - Ventricular (often secondary to mechanical/structural heart disease or channelopathies, such as Brugada) - PR interval disorders/accessory conduction pathways (WPW, LGL, Mahaim syndrome, Breijo syndrome) - Bradyarrhythmia - Sinus node dysfunction - Atrioventricular conduction block (typically second or third degree) - Pacemaker malfunction - Inherited channelopathies - QT interval disorders (Long or short QT) - Romano-Ward syndrome: Autosomal dominant congenital long QT syndrome - Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome: autosomal recessive long QT syndrome associated with deafness - Brugada syndrome - An autosomal dominant mutation in the SCN5A gene, which encodes for voltage-gated sodium channels found in the heart - Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia - Autosomal dominant
