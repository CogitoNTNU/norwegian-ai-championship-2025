on Gram stain.[1] _M. pneumoniae_ ,_C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species are typically gram-negative bacteria, but each has unique virulence factors and characteristics that allow them to survive in hostile environments, including against host defenses. These bacteria are acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets, and, except _Legionella_ species, are transmitted from human to human.[34][33][34] When the inoculating bacteria overwhelm the host defenses, it causes a proliferation of the infectious agent. The pathogen replication triggers the host immune response, leading to inflammation, alveolar irritation, and impairment.[40] These immune responses result in the following signs and symptoms—cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia.[41]\*\*\*\* Atypical bacterial pneumonia infections result in less lobar consolidation and are more likely to be associated with interstitial and bronchopneumonia radiological changes on imaging.[42] Therefore, many patients have subacute presentations and do not appear toxic in these cases; hence, the common term _walking pneumonia_ is typically associated with _M. pneumoniae._ However, this can be a misnomer, as _M. pneumoniae_ can still progress to shock and mechanical ventilation.[43] Due to their intracellular nature, these infections are often challenging to treat because antibiotics must be able to penetrate intracellularly to reach their intended target. ## History and Physical Patients often present with prolonged constitutional symptoms. Although not found to be predictive, it is traditionally taught that patients with atypical bacterial pneumonia infections present gradually, often accompanied by a viral prodrome that includes a sore throat, headache, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fevers.[9] Atypical infections rarely have an obvious consolidation area on auscultation/imaging compared to pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, extra-cardiopulmonary symptoms are often observed; for example, _Mycoplasma_ infections have been associated with vasculitis and thrombosis, and _L._ _pneumophila_ is classically associated with gastrointestinal ailments and electrolyte abnormalities.[21][44][45] Despite the classical thought that bullous myringitis is associated with _M. pneumoniae_ , it has been rarely documented in the literature compared to typical bacteria such as _S. pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_. _M. pneumoniae_ is a significant cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia. Symptoms may include malaise, cough, myalgia, and sore throat. The cough is often dry and worsens at night, often appearing as intractable. Most cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection are mild and resolve on their own. _M. pneumoniae_ can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and cerebral ataxia.[21] Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax, or even respiratory distress
