rate of CO2 elimination (i.e., alveolar ventilation) (PaCO2 =VCO2 /VA). The relationship between minute ventilation and CO2 production in response to exercise can be affected by age and pregnancy.[13] Alveolar ventilation (VA) is the product of minute ventilation (VE) and the ratio of dead space (VD) to tidal volume (Vt) (VA = VE x [1 - VD/Vt]). While decreased VA is the most common reason for the respiratory failure of hypercapnia, increased CO2 production is a very rare reason. Depending on the cause of respiratory failure, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) may be normal or decreased. The two main paradigms responsible for hypercapnia respiratory failure are either manifested by "won't breathe" due to a central drive issue or "can't breathe" as a result of a peripheral neuromuscular defect, resistive loading (narrow airway) or restrictive defect that lead to hypoventilation and hypercapnia. **Respiratory pump failure:** The respiratory pump is comprised of the chest wall, the pulmonary parenchyma, the muscles of respiration, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. The inability to ventilate can occur if any of the components mentioned above of the respiratory pump fails. - Decreased central dive: Sedatives (i.e., alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opiates) and diseases of the central nervous system (i.e., encephalitis, stroke, tumor, and SCI) may impair the respiratory drive, resulting in hypoventilation.[14] - Altered neural and neuromuscular transmission: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, botulism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia graves, organophosphate poisoning, poliomyelitis, spinal cord injury (SCI), tetanus, and transverse myelitis may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation.[14] - Chest wall and pleural disorders: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis, hyperinflation, large pleural effusions, obesity, and thoracoplasty may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation. - Dead space ventilation: Conditions that increase the V/Q ratio, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, and pulmonary embolism, can result in hypoventilation. Hypoventilation typically occurs once dead space ventilation exceeds 50% of total ventilation. - Muscle abnormalities: Diaphragmatic paralysis, diffuse atrophy, muscular dystrophy, and ruptured diaphragm may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation. **Increased dead space:** Dead space (VD) refers to areas of the lung that are not anatomically or physiologically able to exchange gas. Tachypnea can contribute to high CO2 by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/Vt). High alveolar VA and the associated ventilation-perfusion mismatch are considered one of the main mechanisms for developing hypercapnia in
