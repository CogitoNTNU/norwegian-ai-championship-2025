Septal reduction therapy (SRT) effectively reduces LVOT gradients in HCM patients due to LVOT obstruction. SRT can be done by surgical myomectomy or by percutaneous catheter-directed alcohol septal ablation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment options for HCM patients. It highlights the interprofessional team's role in catheter-directed management of HCM as an alternative option to surgical myomectomy. **Objectives:** - Assess the indications of catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. - Evaluate the contraindications of catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. - Identify the equipment needed for catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The diagnosis is established by non-invasive imaging modalities such as 2-dimensional echocardiography (ECHO), cardiovascular magnetic resonance, or cardiac computed tomography. The maximal end-diastolic wall thickness of â‰¥1.5 cm or 1.3 to 1.4cm with a positive family history or positive genetic test without other obvious causes is diagnostic of HCM.[1][2] Septal reduction therapy (SRT), either percutaneously or surgically, is effective in reducing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients. Even though there is increased mortality among HCM patients with LVOT obstruction, the evidence lacks SRT in asymptomatic patients to improve survival. Despite maximal medical therapy in a comprehensive HCM center, SRT is recommended in symptomatic patients.[3] It can be done by either surgical myomectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed alcohol septal ablation (ASA).[4] Here, we discuss the catheter management of HCM with ASA. ## Anatomy and Physiology HCM patients are symptomatic due to dynamic LVOT obstruction, arrhythmias, diastolic dysfunction, ischemia, and autonomic dysfunction. Dynamic LVOT obstruction is due to left ventricular septal hypertrophy and abnormal mitral valve or sub-mitral valvular apparatus morphology. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be observed in any pattern and distribution, with a basal anterior septum and anterior free wall
