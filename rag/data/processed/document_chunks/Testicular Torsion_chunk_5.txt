an interprofessional team. The first person to encounter the patient is the triage nurse, who must be familiar with the symptoms of the disorder. Time is of the essence, and the nurse should be aware of torsion, quickly admit the patient, and quickly notify the ED physician. The ED physician should consult with a radiologist for the appropriate test and, at the same time, consult with the urologist. The nurses should prepare the patient as if he will be going for surgery by keeping the child NPO and having all the blood work completed. If the testing confirms torsion, the urologist is usually required to perform the surgery. The nurse should educate the family and the patient about the potential complications, including loss of the testis and infertility. The nurse should ensure that the patient is administered no food or drink by mouth and have the patient prepared to go for urgent surgery. More importantly, the nurse should avoid giving any pain medications until the patient has been seen by the urologist- or the pain medication will mask the symptoms and delay the diagnosis. Only through a systemic approach to diagnosis and treatment, is the salvage of the testis possible.[9][10] Open communication between the team members is vital if the outcomes are to be improved. [Level 5] **Outcomes** The outcomes of testicular torsion depend on when the patient presents to the ED and how quickly the diagnosis is made and treatment is undertaken. Delays in diagnosis and treatment always lead to testicular atrophy. About 20% to 40% of cases of testicular torsion result in an orchiectomy. The risk of losing a testis is much higher among African Americans and younger males. For those who present within the first 6 hours of symptoms, the salvage rate is nearly 100%, but this number quickly drops to less than 50% if the delay in seeking help is more than 12 to 24 hours. More importantly, when the testis is fixed by orchiopexy, there is also a potential for future torsion.[11][12] [Level 5] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=29993&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=29993) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/mens-health/testicular-torsion/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=29993) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/29993/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=29993) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK448199/figure/article-29993.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK448199/figure/article-29993.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Testicular Necrosis in the Setting of Testicular Torsion.
