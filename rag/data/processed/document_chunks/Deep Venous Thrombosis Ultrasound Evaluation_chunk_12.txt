vascular technicians, and pharmacists. The focus is on the prevention of DVT. In addition to clinicians, both nurses and pharmacists are vital in educating patients about DVT prophylaxis. Nurses are the first professionals to encounter patients being admitted to the hospital, and it is here that the prevention of DVT starts. Nurses must educate the patients on the importance of ambulation, complying with compression stockings, and taking the prescribed anticoagulation medications. In both the operating room and post-surgery, nurses play a key role in reminding physicians of the need for DVT prophylaxis. Each hospital has guidelines on DVT prophylaxis and treatment, and all healthcare workers should follow them. Once a DVT has developed, the pharmacist should be familiar with the current anticoagulants and their indications. They can consult with the prescribing/ordering clinician and perform medication reconciliation. Plus, the pharmacist must educate the patients on the need for treatment compliance and the need to undergo regular testing to ensure that the INR is therapeutic.[37][52] Once DVT is diagnosed, the treatment is with an anticoagulant for 3 to 6 months, and again, monitoring of the INR by a hematology nurse or pharmacist is necessary. Further, these patients need to be monitored for bleeding. Open communication between the interprofessional team is the only way to treat DVT and lower the morbidity of the drugs safely. **Outcomes** Nearly 300,000 patients die from a pulmonary embolus yearly in the US alone. Despite countless guidelines and education of healthcare workers, DVT prophylaxis is often not done. The fact is that DVT is preventable in the majority of patients, and the onus is on healthcare workers to be aware of the condition. For those who develop a DVT and survive, post-thrombotic phlebitis is a lifelong sequela with no ideal treatment.[53][54] This is why interprofessional care coordination and open communication is crucial to managing these patients long-term. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20298&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20298) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20298) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20298/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20298) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK507708/figure/article-20298.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK507708/figure/article-20298.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Deep Vein Thrombosis.
