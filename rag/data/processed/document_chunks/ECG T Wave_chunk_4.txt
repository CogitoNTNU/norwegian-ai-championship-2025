be integrated into a complete diagnostic workup. Metabolic panels and biomarkers of myocardial ischemia are needed in scenarios of suspected ischemia or electrolyte abnormalities. If cerebral T waves are seen, a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan is suggested to look for any acute bleeding or trauma to the central nervous system. If a pulmonary embolism is suspected, a CT angiography should be conducted. ## Treatment / Management Treatment options differ depending on the etiology of the T-wave changes. Some T-wave changes require no intervention. However, some causes of T-wave changes are associated with high morbidity and mortality without emergent intervention. **Ischemia and Infarction** If acute T waves are seen as indicative of ischemia in a coronary artery distribution, management should be focused on reperfusion and treatment of the acute coronary syndrome.[11] **Hyperkalemia** In severe hyperkalemia in the presence of peaked T-waves, calcium gluconate should be administered promptly to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmia. Mild hyperkalemia without T-wave abnormalities can be managed with polystyrene sulfonate, a potassium binder, insulin, which forces potassium intracellularly, or furosemide, which drives potassium out of the body through the urinary tract.[12] **Pulmonary Embolism** Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of T-wave changes. Treatment options for PE vary depending on the size and severity. Acute massive and submassive PEs should be considered for catheter-directed tPA. Smaller pulmonary embolisms in the absence of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain can be found for systemic anticoagulation.[13] All institutions currently or planning on treating PEs in the future are encouraged to set up a pulmonary embolism response team made up of a cardiologist and pulmonologist. This team is designed to swiftly and accurately triage new PEs for appropriate treatment.[14] **Pericarditis** Pericarditis can be managed with ibuprofen and colchicine for at least three months. If recurrent pericarditis occurs, a longer course of treatment is recommended.[15] **Drug-drug interaction or Intoxication** Serum drug levels may help identify intoxication with a particular medication that may be causing ECG abnormalities. It is recommended to stop the drug if intoxication or drug-drug interaction is suspected while workup is being done. Some drugs have reversal agents. For example, dig immune Fab is the first-line agent for digoxin toxicity. It is an immunoglobulin fragment that binds with digoxin and neutralizes it.[10] ## Differential Diagnosis **The differential diagnoses for ECG T waves include the following:** **T-wave Inversion** - Normal variant - Myocardial ischemia - Ventricular strain - Cerebrovascular
