This form of stress testing is generally performed according to protocols. However, patients unable to exercise can sometimes still undergo this test with the administration of a pharmacologic agent that stimulates the heart's activity, simulating exercise-induced changes. This activity specifically focuses on treadmill exercise stress testing and reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing treadmill exercise stress testing; this activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure. **Objectives:** - Review the indications for treadmill testing. - Identify the contraindications to a treadmill test. - Explain the clinical significance of a treadmill test. - Summarize a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing a treadmill stress test.

This form of stress testing is usually performed with exercise protocols using either a treadmill or bicycle. In addition, patients who are unable to exercise may benefit from the administration of a pharmacologic agent that stimulates the heart's activity, simulating exercise-induced changes. With treadmill stress testing, providers can determine a patient's functional capacity, assess the probability and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), and assess the risks, prognosis, and effects of therapy.[1] Observations from the Henry Ford exercise testing (FIT) study appear to suggest a graded and inverse correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness and incidental atrial fibrillation, especially for obese patients.[2] **Exercise Physiology** Exercise is associated with sympathetic stimulation and changes in the coronary vasomotor tone, which affects coronary blood flow. Several studies have reported that the coronaries dilate during exercise.[3] Some reported mechanisms contributing to this dilatation include the release of vasoactive substances from the endothelium due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption, passive relaxation due to the increase in coronary arterial pressure, and endothelium-mediated limitation of constrictor effects of catecholamine. During exercise,
