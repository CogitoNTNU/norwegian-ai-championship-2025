weight heparin showed a decrease in the incidence of pulmonary embolism.[[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remains the preferred anticoagulation option for managing cancer-associated thrombosis.[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) The dosage recommendation for LMWH is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and 1 mg/kg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/minute. Avoid the use of LMWH in patients on dialysis. Other treatment options include direct oral anticoagulants like apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, fondaparinux, and warfarin. In the Caravaggio trial, researchers found apixaban to be non-inferior to LMWH in treating cancer-associated VTE without an increased risk of significant bleeding.[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) Thrombolytic therapy can be used in patients with life or limb-threatening pulmonary embolism or acute deep vein thrombosis considering contraindications such as intracranial tumors or metastasis, active bleeding, and a history of intracranial hemorrhage. NCCN recommends a treatment duration minimum of 3 months or for the duration of active malignancy. For patients with non-catheter-related deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, indefinite anticoagulation is the recommendation. Continuing to assess for benefits vs. risks, as well as monitoring for complications, is essential. In patients with DVT located in the inferior vena cava, iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins, in addition to a contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation, placement of retrievable vena cava filters can prevent pulmonary embolism. Once placed, it is important to periodically assess patients for resolution of contraindications, removal of the vena cava filters, and switching to therapeutic anticoagulation. For patients with catheter-associated thrombosis, treatment consists of removing the catheter or anticoagulation if the catheter remains.[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562222/) ## Staging The severity of the disease is classified as follows: - Provoked: Due to acquired states (surgery, oral contraceptives, trauma, immobility, obesity, cancer) - Unprovoked: Due to idiopathic or endogenous reasons; more likely to suffer recurrence if anticoagulation is discontinued - Proximal: Above the knee, affecting the femoral or iliofemoral veins; much more likely to lead to complications such as pulmonary emboli - Distal: Below the knee ## Prognosis The prognosis for DVT includes the following: - Many DVTs will resolve with no complications. - Post-thrombotic syndrome occurs in 43% of patients 2 years post-DVT (30% mild, 10% moderate, and severe 3%). - The risk of recurrence of DVT is high (up to 25%). - Death occurs in approximately 6% of DVT cases and 12% of pulmonary embolism cases within one month of diagnosis. - Early mortality after venous thromboembolism is strongly associated with the presentation of pulmonary
