Opiates have been used since antiquity to relieve pain and induce euphoria. Today, these agents remain a widely used option for pain relief. Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years and have long been assumed to be relatively safe and nonaddictive when used for chronic pain.[2] In 1995, Dr. James Campbell addressed the American Pain Society, advocating for the evaluation of pain as a vital sign.[3] His intentions were well-meaning, motivated by concerns about the undertreatment of pain. However, over the past 2 decades, numerous reports have raised alarms about the safety of these drugs. Cases of overdose and opiate toxicity are reported regularly across major cities in the United States. Particularly concerning is the dramatic increase in opiate prescriptions over the same period. This widespread prescribing by healthcare providers has contributed to an epidemic of overdoses outside the healthcare setting. Consequently, practicing healthcare professionals should recognize opiate toxicity in patients who present as lethargic or unresponsive without an apparent cause. ([CDC,](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html) 2017) Data released by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that, from 2001 through 2010, the rates of opiate diversion, opiate prescriptions, and opiate-related deaths exponentially increased in the United States. These rates plateaued from 2011 through 2013 but spiked again between 2013 and 2014. Experts in pain management believe that the high number of opiate overdoses is likely unintentional, as patients may have been attempting to manage unrelenting pain. (CDC, 2016) Prescriptions for opioid-containing medications quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, paralleling a 4-fold increase in overdose deaths due to opioids. The majority of opioid-related deaths are attributed to the use of heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone. The issue
