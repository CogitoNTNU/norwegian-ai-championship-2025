exclude any potential metastatic site.[50] **Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma** Adenocarcinoma of the appendix, a rare appendiceal neoplasm with three histopathological subtypes, commonly presents as acute appendicitis. The standard treatment is a right hemicolectomy. The surgical management of appendiceal adenocarcinoma is irrespective of the tumor size or the involvement of the lymph node basin.[51] **Mucocele and Mucinous Neoplasm** Appendiceal mucoceles can manifest with symptoms similar to acute appendicitis. Mucoceles can arise from various benign or malignant processes involving mucosal hyperplasia and intra-appendiceal cystic formations. Several preoperative radiological features, including a well-encapsulated cystic structure in the right lower quadrant, would raise the suspicion of an appendiceal mucocele; a definitive diagnosis requires intraoperative evaluation and histopathological reports. The preferred surgical management of appendiceal mucoceles is an appendectomy with great cautionary measures to prevent capsular rupture. It is important to assess for peritoneal involvement; peritoneal biopsy should be considered. In cases of suspicious mucinous neoplasm of the appendix, it is vital to perform a thorough peritoneal examination and consider recording any findings using the PCIS when mucin is present. Patient selection for the laparoscopic approach in managing appendiceal mucocele is limited to those with radiologic features suggestive of a homogenous cyst.[52] ## Prognosis Appendectomy is a relatively safe surgical procedure. In a global observational study, the overall mortality rate for appendicitis was 0.28%.[53] The mortality rate for appendicitis is higher in under-industrialized countries and ranges from 1% to 4%, whereas in industrialized countries, the mortality rate is 0.24%. The following factors are associated with increased mortality rates in appendicitis: age greater than 80 years, immunosuppression, severe cardiovascular disease or the presence of other comorbidities, previous episodes of suspected appendicitis, and prior antimicrobial therapy. If acute appendicitis is diagnosed and definitively treated early in the course of the disease, recovery is expected within 24 to 48 hours. However, patients that present with advanced abscesses, peritonitis, or sepsis may have a more prolonged and complicated course, possibly requiring additional surgery. ## Complications The most common complication of appendectomy is an infection of the surgical site; this risk is highest in patients with complicated appendicitis with perforation. Surgical site infections include postoperative abscesses and wound infections. Hematomas and postoperative pain are also common complications of appendectomy. [6] Recurrent appendicitis can occur in almost half of the patients managed nonoperatively; reported recurrence rates vary by study and length of follow-up. An interval appendectomy may be performed to mitigate the risk
