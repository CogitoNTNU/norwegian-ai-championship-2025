= PA02 - Pa02** - Pa02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery - PA02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar sac To calculate the PAO2 and Pa02 - PAO2 = FiO2 (P atmospheric - P water vapor) – (PCO2/R). - PaO2 = partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. PaO2 in arterial blood gas can be used as follows. - FiO2 is the concentration of inspired oxygen expressed as a fraction. This is around 0.21 at room air. - P atmospheric is the barometric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level). - P water vapor is the water vapor pressure (48 mmHg at 37 C). - PaCO2 is the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide. If approximated, this is presumed to be equal to arterial PCO2. PACO2 is presumed to be equal to 40 mmHg - R is the respiratory quotient, equating to about 0.8 on a regular diet. The normal alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is as follows: - PA02 = alveolar partial pressure of O2 = FiO2 × (patmospheric - P water vapor) - (PCO2/R). - 0.21 × (760 - 48) - (40/0.8) = 150-50 = 100 mmHg The normal partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood is between 75 to 100mmHg. - PA02 - Pa02 = 100 mmHg - 75 mm = 25 mmHg - PA02-Pa02 =100 mmHg -100 mmHg = 0 mmHg This implies that the A-a gradient can have values that range from 0 to 25 mmHg The normal A-a gradient is usually less than 10 mmHg. However, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch can significantly increase FES. **Bronchoalveolar Lavage** Bronchoalveolar lavage has been extensively researched as a diagnostic tool for FES. Lipid inclusion in the macrophages might point to a diagnosis of FES but is not specific, as this can be seen in other clinical conditions. Moreover, the procedure is time-consuming and invasive and might not give the best diagnostic yield. Attempts at developing biological markers for FES have been disappointing because of low specificity. Lipase, free fatty acid, and phospholipase A2 have been demonstrated to be elevated in FES, but this also can be seen in other disease conditions of the lung Blood, urine, and sputum analysis might show the presence of fat globules. Again, this is nonspecific in fat embolism and FES. **Imaging Studies** \*\*_Chest X-ray_ \*\* The chest X-ray reveals the presence of the following: - Diffuse
