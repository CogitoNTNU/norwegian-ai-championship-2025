for ancillary diagnostic testing such as computed tomography (CT) and offer valuable insights into fluid characteristics, which can aid in diagnosis (see **Image.** Bilateral Pleural Effusions on Chest Computed Tomography).[15] In addition, thoracic ultrasound assists in differentiating fluid accumulation from other conditions that present as radiopaque abnormalities on chest radiographs, such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Pleural fluid appears hypoechoic on ultrasound. The dependent chest area and surrounding anatomical structures must be examined for better visualization. Effusion echogenicity must be noted since features such as septations may indicate a complex effusion arising from conditions such as parapneumonic effusion or empyema. The hematocrit sign is characterized by smoke-like shadows, which may indicate the presence of a hemothorax. A complex-appearing fluid collection necessitates planning for chest tube thoracostomy (CTT). Blood tests should include a complete blood count with differential (a leukocytosis may indicate infection, bleeding, or malignancy), serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function tests and enzymes, albumin, lipase, and cardiac enzymes. Routinely assessed biomarkers after thoracentesis include fluid pH, fluid and serum protein levels, fluid and serum LDH levels, fluid glucose levels, fluid cell count differential, fluid gram stain, and culture. Fluid cytology may also be examined in specific situations. Light's criteria may then be applied to classify the fluid as an exudate or transudate. Light's criteria should be interpreted within the clinical context as it has been reported to misclassify 25% to 30% of transudates as exudates in heart failure-related pleural effusion. In such instances, obtaining a fluid B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or computing the albumin or protein gradient between serum and pleural fluid is helpful. A serum-to-pleural fluid albumin ratio exceeding 1.2 g/dL or a serum-to-pleural fluid total protein gradient greater than 2.5 g/dL in suspected heart failure could indicate a transudative effusion.[16] Exudative effusions require further investigation to identify the underlying cause. In some cases, cell count differentials can aid in narrowing down potential diagnoses. A primarily lymphocytic effusion may suggest tuberculosis, post-CABG, rheumatoid arthritis, yellow nail syndrome, chylothorax, or malignancy. Eosinophilia in pleural effusion is rare and typically observed in pneumothorax, hemothorax, parasitic disease, or drug-induced effusion. Parapneumonic effusions show a neutrophil-predominant cell count. Pleural LDH values exceeding 1000 U/L are observed in tuberculosis, lymphoma, and empyema. A pH below 7.2 indicates a complex pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia, which almost always requires CTT insertion for drainage. Low pH levels may also indicate esophageal rupture or rheumatoid
