echocardiogram in patients who are in cardiogenic shock and suspected to have LVOT obstruction is essential in the early management of these patients. Patients with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are also at risk of developing an intraventricular thrombus in the setting of severe left ventricular dysfunction. Approximately 1% to 1.5% of patients with all types of stress cardiomyopathy, including mid-ventricular cardiomyopathy in the International Takotsubo Registry Study, were found to have an LV thrombus. In the management of patients with LV thrombus, the use of warfarin is recommended for three months; however, the duration of systemic anticoagulation can be modified based on the rate at which the LV dysfunction improves, and the thrombus resolves.[4] ## Differential Diagnosis Patients suspected of having mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should have acute coronary syndrome ruled out with coronary angiography to ensure that there is not significant coronary artery disease in the territory of the affected walls of the ventricular cavity. It is critical to understand that in some patients, the angiographic analysis will show evidence of concurrent obstructive coronary artery disease; however, the disease in the coronaries will not match the territory of the LV wall motion dysfunction.[13] Other medical conditions to consider in patients with suspected mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are as follows: - An acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine abuse - Myocarditis - Acute brain injury in patients with pheochromocytoma Detailed history, physical exam, and toxicology assays can help narrow our differential diagnoses. Myocarditis is diagnosed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which will show myocardial inflammation and scar. Patients with pheochromocytoma will have clinical findings and symptoms of tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and headache.[14][15][16] ## Prognosis Patients with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mostly recover with conservative management; patients who survive the acute phase of this syndrome recover their LV ejection fraction within four weeks.[17][9][18] ## Complications The risk of in-hospital complications in patients with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is similar to that in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The combined risk of CPR, ventilatory therapy, cardiogenic shock, and catecholamine use is about 19% for patients with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome.[4] ## Deterrence and Patient Education If available, patient education should be provided using resources familiar to the patient, such as online resources and pamphlets. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Educating patients at risk for this type of cardiomyopathy (for example, post-menopausal females) and making a closed-loop communication between them and their providers, can help
