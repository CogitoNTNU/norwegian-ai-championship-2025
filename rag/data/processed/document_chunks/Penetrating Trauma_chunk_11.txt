the second day, and 40 mg on the final day.[64] - Oral prednisone: This drug may be administered at a dosage of 1 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 60 mg daily, for 1 to 2 weeks. Longer courses often yield better outcomes in patients who can tolerate high-dose steroids for more than 1 week.[65][61] - Steroid injections: The JTS guideline recommends high-dose oral or transtympanic steroid injections, when not contraindicated, for patients with threshold shifts of more than 25 dB in 3 consecutive frequencies. The injection regimen typically includes transtympanic dexamethasone at a concentration of 24 mg/mL. Patients should undergo weekly audiometric evaluations, regardless of the treatment approach. If follow-up audiograms indicate some recovery, additional injections are recommended, up to a total of 3.[25] **Antioxidants and neurotrophins:** These may provide benefits in the acute treatment of NIHL.[66] Although the evidence supporting the use of antioxidants and neurotrophins is limited, they are generally well-tolerated. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy:** This therapy may be beneficial for AAT, particularly if corticosteroid therapy is ineffective. Treatment typically involves 120-minute dives to pressures ranging from 200 to 280 kPa daily for 10 days.[64][67][68][49][50] The AAOHNS guidelines on sudden sensorineural hearing loss indicate that if there is no response to initial therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with corticosteroids can serve as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset.[45] Temporary placement of ear ventilation tubes may also be necessary. In summary, key management factors include the prior use of HPDs, whether in a linear or nonlinear manner, and the initiation of early steroid treatment following an AAT injury, preferably within 24 to 72 hours.[64] Hearing recovery may vary based on age and comorbidities, necessitating individualized clinical treatment. Despite guideline recommendations, oral steroid treatment may be more favorable than transtympanic steroid injections and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in clinical practice. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses for AAT include: - Sudden sensorineural hearing loss - Head trauma causing inner ear, cochleovestibular nerve injury, or brainstem pathology - Stroke - posterior circulation cerebrovascular accident, typically characterized by sudden onset of hearing loss and frequently associated with other neurological deficits [69] - Viral infections (primarily) - Autoimmune diseases - Chemotherapy for cancer or infections - Neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis - Ménière disease ## Prognosis The time interval from AAT to triage, initial audiometry, and treatment by an otolaryngologist is crucial for improving prognosis, especially if steroid therapy is initiated.
