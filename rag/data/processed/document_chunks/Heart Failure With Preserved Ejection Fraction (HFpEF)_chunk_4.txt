the predominant risk factor may or may not indicate a specific phenotype of HFpEFâ€”thus, the heterogeneity of the disease.[16] Risk factors for the development of HFpEF appear to include but are not limited to: - Increasing age - Female sex - Type 2 diabetes - Obesity - Sleep apnea - Hypertension - Pulmonary hypertension - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Iron deficiency, with or without anemia - Coronary artery disease - Atrial fibrillation - Dysrhythmias [16] The exact pathogenic role of each risk factor is poorly understood. **Etiologies of Secondary Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** Secondary HFpEF occurs in a clinical condition that directly causes the heart to fail. These conditions are sometimes referred to as "HFpEF mimics."[16] These mimics include but are not limited to restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies of any etiology, constrictive pericarditis, and valvular heart disease.[16][7] In the United States, left-sided valvular disease is the most commonly encountered HFpEF mimic, and aortic stenosis should be suspected in all patients with signs, symptoms, or suspicion of HFpEF.[21][16] **Etiologies of Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction** Patients with HFpEF are at increased risk for deterioration of cardiac function in the setting of various commonly encountered clinical conditions. The development of a clinical condition requiring increased cardiac output that the failing heart cannot meet increases the risk of acute pulmonary and systemic venous congestion.[22] Examples of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions that may induce the acute decompensation of patients with HFpEF include but are not limited to: - Acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease - Anemia - Chronic pulmonary disease, or the exacerbation thereof - Dysrhythmia, particularly tachyarrhythmia, especially new-onset atrial fibrillation - Infection - Ischemia - Increased salt intake or water retention - Medication noncompliance, including antihypertensive or diuretics - Poorly controlled or uncontrolled hypertension. ## Epidemiology Heart failure is a significant public health issue in the United States and globally. Worldwide estimates for individuals living with heart failure exceed 60 million people, equating to a prevalence of 1% to 3% of the global population.[17] Heart failure is the most common reason for hospitalization for patients 65 and older in the United States, and rates of hospitalizations increased from 2014 to 2017.[23] Approximately 6.7 million Americans older than 25 are estimated to have some form of heart failure; this number is expected to increase to 8.5 million Americans by 2030.[23] The incidence and prevalence
