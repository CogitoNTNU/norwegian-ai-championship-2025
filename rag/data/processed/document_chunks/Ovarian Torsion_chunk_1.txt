of the two ligaments holding it in suspension. This torsion impedes venous outflow and eventually, arterial inflow. In a study of torsions confirmed by surgery, 46% were associated with neoplasm, and 48% were associated with cysts. Of these masses, 89% were benign, and 80% of patients were under age 50. Therefore, reproductive-age females are at greatest risk of torsion.[2] However, torsion can still occur in normal ovaries, especially in the pediatric population. Pregnancy, as well as patients undergoing fertility treatments, are high risk due to enlarged follicles on the ovary.[1] ## Epidemiology Torsion occurs in females of all ages but is most common in women of childbearing age. In a 10-year review of surgical emergencies at a womenâ€™s hospital, ovarian torsion was the fifth most common, accounting for 2.7 percent. Only 20% of patients are premenarchal, and 50% of these will have a normal ovary. The majority of reproductive-age females with torsion had a benign ovarian mass.[3] Pregnancy is also an independent risk factor for torsion. In a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with torsion, 8 to 15% of them were pregnant.[1] ## Pathophysiology Torsion occurs when the ovary twists over the supporting ligaments, the infundibulopelvic ligament, and the utero-ovarian ligament. This causes swelling and obstruction of blood flow. Initially, the venous outflow is obstructed, and later arterial inflow is also interrupted due to increased swelling, leading to necrosis of the ovary, infarction, hemorrhage, and possibly peritonitis. The right side has been seen more commonly than left-sided torsion, which is thought to be due to increased space in the right pelvis due to the location of the sigmoid colon in the left.[4] ## History and Physical The patient most commonly will present with lower abdominal pain or pelvic pain. Pain can be sharp, dull, constant, or intermittent. Pain may radiate to the abdomen, back, or flank.[5] One study showed that post-menopausal women commonly presented with dull, constant pain when compared to premenopausal, who more commonly had sharp stabbing pain. Symptoms may or may not be intermittent if the ovary is torsing and detorsing. The patient may also have associated nausea and vomiting. In one study of children and adolescents with lower abdominal pain, vomiting was found to be an independent risk factor for ovarian torsion.[6] The patient may or may not already have a known adnexal mass, which predisposes them to torsion. Fever may be present if the ovary is
