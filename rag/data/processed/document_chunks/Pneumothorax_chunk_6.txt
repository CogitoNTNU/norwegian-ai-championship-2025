observation or needle aspiration is typically insufficient. These cases require hospital admission and chest tube insertion (ranging from 20 to 28 French), which is typically connected to a water-seal device with or without additional suctioning.[41] **Management of Unstable Patients** Patients with traumatic or tension pneumothorax require emergent thoracostomy or chest tube placement.[42] In most cases, non-tension pneumothorax can be effectively managed with small-bore pigtail catheters inserted using the Seldinger technique. Very large pneumothoraces may necessitate large-bore chest tubes.[43] A thoracostomy with a large-bore chest tube insertion is necessary if there is a concomitant hemothorax. Studies have shown that simple aspiration has a higher failure rate compared to chest tube drainage when used as the initial management strategy for complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases.[44] As a result, chest tube placement is often preferred in patients with large or recurrent pneumothoraces to ensure adequate lung reexpansion and reduce the risk of early recurrence. **Air Drainage Techniques** Air drainage techniques are essential in managing pneumothorax. These techniques help remove air from the pleural space, facilitate lung reexpansion, and prevent recurrence. The choice of technique depends on the size of the pneumothorax, the patient's clinical stability, and the underlying etiology. - Needle aspiration technique: A large-bore (14-gauge) needle approximately 10 cm long can be inserted at one of 2 locations (see **Image.** Chest Wall Decompression.) - Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, above the superior edge of the third rib - Fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, above the upper border of the sixth rib This placement method aims to prevent injury to the neurovascular bundle, which runs along the inferior edge of each rib.[45] - Large-bore catheter drainage technique: For cases requiring large-bore catheter drainage, an 8.3-French pigtail catheter can be introduced into the pleural cavity using ultrasound. Similar to needle aspiration, there are multiple insertion points. - Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line - Fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, ensuring placement above the superior rib edge to minimize the risk of neurovascular bundle injury.[46] **Special Considerations in Pneumothorax Management** The management of pneumothorax in special populations requires specific considerations. In pregnant women, nearly 50% of pneumothorax cases resolve with conservative observation, and fetal complications remain below 5%.[47] Patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, even if asymptomatic, should be educated about the risk of pneumothorax, particularly during pregnancy, and should seek immediate medical attention if symptoms arise. Throughout pregnancy,
