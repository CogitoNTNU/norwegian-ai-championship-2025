heart due to the persistence of autoantigens. This prolonged inflammation causes myocyte necrosis, followed by fibrosis, and ultimately results in dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] ## History and Physical The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild viral illness to fulminant heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or sudden cardiac death. The onset can be acute or insidious, and there are no pathognomonic symptoms specific to the condition. The classic triad includes chest pain, arrhythmias, and signs of heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Common symptoms may include fever, malaise, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, presyncope, and syncope. Chest pain may either mimic pericarditis—particularly in cases of myopericarditis, which occurs in at least 35% of patients—or resemble the central, severe discomfort characteristic of acute coronary syndrome. A preceding acute febrile illness, often respiratory or gastrointestinal in origin, is reported in approximately 60% of cases. Clinicians should also inquire about a history of prior myocarditis, autoimmune disorders, family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death, and recent exposure to cardiotoxic agents. Fulminant presentations may resemble acute decompensated heart failure, characterized by respiratory distress, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope, hemodynamic instability, and potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In a study involving patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, approximately 25% exhibited reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or symptoms of low cardiac output. On physical examination, findings typically correlate with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. In patients with decompensated heart failure, signs may include an S3 gallop, pulmonary rales, jugular venous distension, and peripheral edema. A pericardial friction rub may be heard in cases with pericardial involvement. A pansystolic murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation may be present in patients with ventricular dilation. Additional findings may point toward systemic disease, depending on the underlying etiology. For example, lymphadenopathy may indicate sarcoidosis; a maculopapular rash may suggest eosinophilic myocarditis; and features such as erythema marginatum, polyarthralgia, chorea, and subcutaneous nodules are characteristic of acute rheumatic fever. Dysphagia may be observed in Chagas disease, while diphtheritic myocarditis can be associated with neurologic manifestations. ## Evaluation The ACC recommends a structured 5-step approach for evaluating and diagnosing acute myocarditis. This framework integrates clinical judgment with targeted diagnostic tools to ensure a comprehensive and systematic assessment. - Step 1—Initial evaluation: When acute myocarditis is clinically suspected, the first step involves obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, cardiac biomarkers, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a transthoracic echocardiogram.
