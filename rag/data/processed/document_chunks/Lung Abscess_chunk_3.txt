foreign body, enlarged lymph nodes, aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, and congenital malformation. In remaining cases, a lung abscess results from the hematogenous spread of an extrapulmonary pathology, including abdominal sepsis, infective endocarditis, and septic thromboembolism. ## Histopathology Acute lung abscesses are typically characterized by poorly defined borders within the lung parenchyma and are filled with thick necrotic debris. Histologically, the central region of an acute abscess contains necrotic tissue intermingled with necrotic granulocytes and bacteria. Surrounding this central area are intact neutrophilic granulocytes, dilated blood vessels, and inflammatory edema (**Image.** Acute Lung Abscess). In contrast, chronic lung abscesses often have an irregular, star-like shape with well-defined borders in the lung parenchyma. These abscesses contain a grayish lining or thick debris. The center of a chronic abscess is filled with pus, with or without bacteria. Surrounding the abscess is a pyogenic membrane through which white blood cells migrate into the abscess cavity. The area around the pyogenic membrane includes lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes within the connective tissue.[2] (**Image.** Chronic Lung Abscess) ## History and Physical Early signs and symptoms of a lung abscess are similar to pneumonia and include fever, chills, cough, night sweats, dyspnea, weight loss, fatigue, chest pain, and occasionally anemia. Initially, the cough is nonproductive, but it becomes productive when bronchial communication develops, a hallmark sign of lung abscess. This productive cough may sometimes be accompanied by hemoptysis. Differential diagnoses for lung abscesses include conditions like cavitary tuberculosis and mycoses, although these rarely show the radiological sign of a gas-liquid level. Cavitating bronchial carcinomas (eg, squamous cell or small cell carcinomas) typically present with thicker, more irregular walls than infectious lung abscesses. The absence of fever, purulent sputum, and leukocytosis can suggest a carcinoma rather than an infectious disease. ## Evaluation Chest radiographs and CT aid in the diagnosis of a lung abscess. Differentiating between lung abscesses and pulmonary cystic lesions, including intrapulmonary bronchial cysts, sequestration, or secondary infected emphysematous bullae, can be challenging. However, the lesion's location and clinical signs often guide the diagnosis. Localized pleural empyema can be distinguished using a CT scan (**Image**. Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess) or ultrasound. The radiological sign of an air-fluid level can also be seen in hydatid cysts of the lung.[10] Sputum examination helps identify microbiological agents or confirm bronchial carcinoma. Microbiologic analysis of sputum can potentially assist in management. If the patient presents with risk factors
