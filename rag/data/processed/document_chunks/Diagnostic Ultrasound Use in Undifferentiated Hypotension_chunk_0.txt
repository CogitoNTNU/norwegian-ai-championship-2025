At times, the available history is limited, and the physical exam alone can be misleading. Multiple ultrasound protocols have been proposed for the evaluation of the hypotensive patient. This activity reviews the commonly used rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of hypotensive patients. **Objectives:** - Identify the indications for the rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol. - Explain the steps involved in performing the rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol. - Summarize how ultrasound can be a useful modality for the evaluation of hypotensive patients. - Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of ultrasound to evaluate hypotensive patients to improve patient outcomes.

Instead, using bedside ultrasound can quickly narrow the potential etiologies of the hypotension.[4] Multiple ultrasound protocols have been proposed for the evaluation of the hypotensive patient. The commonly-used rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) exam will be reviewed here. This bedside protocol has been demonstrated to quickly and accurately determine the etiology of shock in the hands of an emergency medicine physician.[5] The HI-MAP mnemonic describes the components of the RUSH protocol: heart, inferior vena cava (IVC), Morrison’s pouch (focused assessment with sonography for trauma [FAST] views with thoracic windows), aorta, pulmonary. This allows for a systematic approach to the exam.[5] Others have also simplified the exam into the “pump, tanks, pipes” approach. ## Technique or Treatment **The RUSH Exam** Heart: At least two views of the heart should be obtained to answer 3 important clinical questions. 1. First, how well is the heart pumping? This question can be answered by obtaining a parasternal long-axis view to assess the volume change and general activity of the left ventricle from systole to diastole. From here, various
