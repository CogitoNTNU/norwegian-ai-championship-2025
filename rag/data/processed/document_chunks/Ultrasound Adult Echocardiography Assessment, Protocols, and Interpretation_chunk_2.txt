view: left atrium, aortic arch, brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and right pulmonary artery - This view helps diagnose aorta diseases such as aortic dissection and coarctation of the aorta. In this view, a congenital heart defect, patent ductus arteriosus, can be identified.[4] ## Indications **Appropriate Use And Indication Criteria for Echocardiography According to ACCF/ASE/AHA/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCM/ SCCT/SCMR 2011** 1. Symptoms related to cardiac diseases such as chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, palpitations, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and peripheral embolic event 1. Previous diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray indicating cardiac disease 1. Premature ventricular contraction (frequent or exercise-induced) 1. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular node re-entry tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia (sustained or non-sustained) 1. Evaluation of right ventricular function (fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, right index of myocardial performance, and pulmonary artery pressure in a patient with suspected pulmonary artery hypertension 1. Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance (>1 year) for diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension patients without a change in symptoms or physical examination 1. To guide management in patients diagnosed with pulmonary artery hypertension and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination 1. Patient in shock with an uncertain or suspected cardiac cause 1. For evaluation of a patient with a suspicion of myocardial infarction, either with chest pain or diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram indicating myocardial infarction 1. For diagnosis of valvular heart disease 1. To guide management in patients diagnosed with valvular heart disease and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination 1. Patients with suspicion of hypertensive heart disease, prosthetic valve dysfunction, infective endocarditis, heart failure, congenital heart disease, cardiac mass, pericardial disease, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, or cardiovascular source of embolus [5][6] **Indication for Transesophageal Echocardiography** 1. Transthoracic echo is nondiagnostic due to the patient's characteristics 1. To guide percutaneous noncoronary cardiac interventions such as closure device placement, radiofrequency ablation, and percutaneous valve procedures 1. To rule out cardiovascular sources such as embolus in patients with no other non-cardiac cause 1. To help decide cardioversion, anticoagulation, and ablation in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation 1. To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with moderate-high pretest probability **Indication for Stress Echocardiography** 1. Patients with intermediate and high pre-test probability for coronary artery disease 1. Patients with a possible acute coronary syndrome (electrocardiogram: no ischemic changes or with left bundle branch block or
