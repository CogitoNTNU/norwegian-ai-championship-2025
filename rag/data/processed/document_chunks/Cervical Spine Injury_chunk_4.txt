sensitive in detection of cervical injury, but the incidence of injury in this study was low.[12][13] The weight of the evidence supports clinical decision rule use to clear the geriatric cervical spine, but given that the geriatric trauma patient has double the risk of cervical spine injury as compared to younger patients, the provider should have a low threshold to image these patients. Geriatric patients with a cervical spine fracture have a high rate of fractures to other vertebrae in the spinal column. Therefore, diagnosis of a fracture in the cervical spine should prompt imaging of the spine in its entirety.[14][15][16][17][18][17] ## Treatment / Management Management of cervical spine injury in geriatric patients is controversial. Options for upper cervical spine injuries include rigid collar immobilization without reduction, halo cast immobilization with reduction, and surgical management. A metanalysis of these management strategies found no difference in morbidity, mortality, or complications, and non-union was common. Since patients often have other associated injuries, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team including trauma surgery, orthopedics, physical therapy, and medical doctors.[12] ## Differential Diagnosis - Acute torticollis - Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndrome - Cervical strain - Hanging injuries and strangulation - Neck trauma - Septic shock - Spinal cord infections - Spinal cord injuries - Spinal cord neoplasms - Thoracic outlet syndrome imaging - Vertebral artery dissection ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes An interprofessional approach to cervical spine injury in the elderly is recommended. Unlike the younger patient, the management of cervical spine injury in the elderly patient remains controversial. Making the treatment more difficult is that many elderly patients also have numerous comorbidities. Thus, these patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes trauma surgery, orthopedics, physical therapy, and medical doctors. No matter what treatment approach is undertaken, one should consider the patient's age, comorbidity and potential complication of the procedure. Many elderly patients may not be candidates for surgery, and one also has to take into account the post-procedure quality of life.[12] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=38689&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=38689) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/joint-muscle-and-bone/geriatric-cervical-spine-injury/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=38689) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/38689/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=38689) ## References 1.
