CK levels, potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis.[56] This risk increases if the patient takes a drug that inhibits cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4).[57] Some common medications to avoid in patients on statin therapy include clarithromycin, erythromycin, verapamil, tamoxifen, and antifungal agents.[56] Low levels of CK can be present in patients with connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Low levels may be seen in patients with reduced physical activity, such as elderly bedridden patients.[58] A low level of serum CK is associated with an increased risk of death in a CKD population.[59] A CK before the start of peritoneal dialysis between 111 and 179 IU/L is associated with a lower risk of death.[60] Serum CK activity demonstrates an inverse relationship with thyroid activity. About 60% of hypothyroid subjects show an average elevation of CK activity fivefold more than the upper reference limit.[61] The major isoenzyme is CK-MM, suggesting muscular involvement. In subclinical hypothyroidism, some degree of dysfunction is evident in skeletal muscle metabolism.[62][63] Strenuous, prolonged exercise results in large increases in serum CK.[64] In untrained persons, serum CK appears to increase proportionately to the duration and intensity of the exercise; however, conditioned persons show smaller changes. Sustained exercise increases the CK-MB content of skeletal muscle, owing to the phenomenon of “fetal reversion,” where fetal patterns of protein synthesis reappear.[65][66] Thus, serum CK-MB isoenzyme may increase in such circumstances. This explanation may also account for the elevated CK-MB values sometimes observed in chronic renal failure (uremic myopathy).[67] Plasma CK activity is significantly associated with blood pressure in the general population and is thought to contribute to hypertension by increasing vascular contractility and renal sodium retention.[68][69] Similar to the association in the general population, plasma CK activity measured in early pregnancy is associated with blood pressure during pregnancy.[70] Plasma CK activity is also associated with severe gestational hypertension diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation but not with preeclampsia or HELLP, which suggests differences in pathophysiology.[71] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety A quality management system (QMS) is essential for laboratory tests to ensure accuracy, reliability, and timeliness. Poor QMS can lead to unwarranted treatment or complications, delayed diagnoses, and unnecessary follow-up, among other consequences.[72] A QMS framework provides the laboratory with a set of essential building blocks, including well-defined objectives, standards, and procedures concerning quality management, employee training, education, calibration, maintenance of lab equipment, raw material or test sample handling, instrumentation
