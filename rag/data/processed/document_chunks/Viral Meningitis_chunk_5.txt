overall bacterial meningitis, the annual case fatality rate in 2010 was 14.3%. Pathogen-specific mortality:[6] - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 17.9% - _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 10.1% - Group B _Streptococcus_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 11.1% - _H._ i _nfluenzae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 7% - _Listeria monocytogenes_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 18.1% ## Complications A metaanalysis published in 2010 from a cohort of pediatric patients reported that the median risk of sequelae post-discharge was 19.9%. In this study, the most common organism isolated was _H. influenzae_ , followed by _S. pneumoniae_. The most common sequelae were hearing loss (6%), followed by behavioral (2.6%) and cognitive difficulties (2.2%), motor deficit (2.3%), seizure disorder (1.6%) and visual impairment (0.9%). [17] Other complications include: - Increased intracranial pressure from cerebral edema caused by increased intracellular fluid in the brain. Several factors are involved in the development of cerebral edema: increased in blood-brain barrier permeability, cytotoxicity from cytokines, immune cells, and bacteria. - Hydrocephalus - Cerebrovascular complications - Focal neurologic deficits ## Consultations - Infectious diseases specialist in case of unidentified or rare pathogen - Neurology to aid in seizure management - Neurosurgery when there is suspicion of progression to brain abscess - Rheumatology and heme/oncology in case of non-infectious cause ## Pearls and Other Issues Differentiating between bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis may be difficult. CSF analysis may not be conclusive, and cultures do not immediately yield an answer. Multiplex and specific PCR panels are available and provide information in a few hours. Given the morbidity and mortality, it is prudent to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy and admit all those with suspected meningitis to the hospital on droplet precautions, until pathogen is identified, and appropriate antibiotics have been given for 24 hours. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Meningitis is a serious disorder with high morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with meningitis first present to the emergency department and a streamlined interprofessional approach is vital if one wants to lower the high morbidity. The triage nurse must be fully aware of the signs and symptoms of the illness and refer the patient immediately to the emergency department clinician. Other specialists who are usually involved in the care of these patients are neurologists, pediatricians, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and pharmacists. If bacterial meningitis is suspected, prompt antibiotics should be started even in the absence of laboratory results. The pharmacist,
