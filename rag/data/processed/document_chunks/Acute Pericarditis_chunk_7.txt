diagnosis of acute pericarditis.[32] Certain clues may help identify the underlying cause of pericarditis. Viral pericarditis is often associated with a flu-like prodrome, such as fever or upper respiratory symptoms. Autoimmune and inflammatory etiologies may present with systemic manifestations, such as polyarthritis in rheumatoid arthritis, skin and kidney manifestations in SLE, or asterixis and encephalopathy in uremia.[34][35] A history of prior pericardial injury, such as cardiac surgery or blunt trauma, should also be considered, as symptoms may emerge days to weeks after the initial event.[32] ## Treatment / Management All patients with suspected acute pericarditis should undergo an ECG, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Myocardial inflammatory and injury markers, such as ESR, CRP, and troponins, should also be measured (Class I, LOE C).[34][36][37] In regions where tuberculosis is not a concern, the initial workup is often sufficient, as most cases respond promptly to empiric treatment.[36] However, additional testing may be warranted if a specific cause is suspected and should be tailored to the suspected etiology. First-level tests, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, are recommended if further evaluation is pursued, as they may suggest specific etiologies such as uremia or infection. Blood cultures, viral seromarkers, and tuberculosis testing—such as purified protein derivative (PPD) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRAs)—may also be indicated in select patients. HIV testing, using antibody/antigen tests or nucleic acid testing, should be performed if an opportunistic infection is identified, given the strong correlation between immunocompromised states and fungal or tuberculosis infections.[36] Additional workups may include testing for antinuclear antibodies or conducting targeted investigations for suspected systemic diseases, such as sarcoidosis. The 2015 ESC guidelines recommend CT or MRI as Class I options for second-line testing.[36][38] Cardiac CT may reveal thickened pericardial layers and pericardial fluid accumulation, with calcification often prominent in cases of constrictive pericarditis. However, cardiac CT is unsuitable for assessing hemodynamic compromise in cardiac tamponade, as echocardiography is more effective for this purpose. Additionally, cardiac CT carries an increased radiation risk. Cardiac MRI provides detailed information, including late gadolinium enhancement within the pericardial layers or myocardium in cases of myopericarditis. This imaging technique can also detect intra-myocardial strands associated with fibrinous pericardial effusion and is highly effective for evaluating myocardial function and identifying suspicious pericardial masses.[39] Emergent pericardiocentesis is recommended for patients presenting with cardiac tamponade.[40] Pericardiocentesis may also be performed electively in cases of moderate-to-large pericardial
