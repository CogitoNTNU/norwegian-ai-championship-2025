or heat exhaustion can occur concurrently with EAH, given the similarities in precipitating events and risk factors.[6] The serum sodium should be determined if point-of-care (POC) serum sodium testing is available (though this is not often practical due to cost and limited functional temperature range of POC testing devices).[1][2] A history supporting excessive hypotonic fluid intake and prolonged exertion should be taken if the patient can participate in an interview or a coach, teammate, partner, or another witness is available. A serum sodium level of less than 135 mmol/L with accompanying excessive fluid intake history is diagnostic for EAH.[1][2] The serum glucose should also be determined if POC glucose testing is available, as hypoglycemia can present similarly. ## Treatment / Management **Prehospital** Prior to treatment, EAH must be correctly differentiated from other exertional illnesses such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST), as their treatments are often contradictory. Treatment is dictated by the presence or absence of neurologic symptoms. The goal of treatment is the correction of serum sodium and improvement in symptoms. If a patient does not demonstrate neurologic symptoms, EAH is considered mild, and the patient is eligible for oral fluid restriction. Patients restrict their total fluid intake to induce osmotic ADH suppression and, therefore, free water excretion.[2] Patients may also be given concentrated oral sodium repletion, though this may be poorly tolerated due to taste or nausea and vomiting. Proposed regimens include 100 ml of hypertonic saline, 3 or 4 broth bouillon cubes in 125 ml of water, or a serving of salted pretzels.[2] Oral hypertonic saline is as effective as IV hypertonic saline in mild EAH. One study demonstrated faster time to recovery and shorter duration of hospital stay for athletes who receive oral treatment.[5] IV isotonic fluids of any type or volume are not recommended in mild EAH. EAH is considered severe if a patient demonstrates neurologic symptoms (altered mental status, seizure, coma). The patient should receive a bolus of 100 ml of IV hypertonic saline.[2] This can be repeated every 10 minutes for a total of 3 doses. Up to 600-1000 ml over 1 hour of hypertonic saline has been given without complication in case studies, though larger volumes of sodium repletion increase the risk for rapid sodium correction and osmotic demyelination.[8][2] **Hospital** On transfer to the hospital for advanced care, patients with suspected EAH should have immediate
