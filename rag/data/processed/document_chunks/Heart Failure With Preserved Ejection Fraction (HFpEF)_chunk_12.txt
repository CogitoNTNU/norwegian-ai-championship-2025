reduce hospitalizations, and effectively manage underlying comorbidities. To this end, lifestyle and behavioral modifications are a cornerstone of therapeutic intervention. **Lifestyle interventions** Several studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[71] Exercise training, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, and weight loss improve functional status, exercise performance, rates of heart failure-specific hospitalization, and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[72] Caloric restriction and exercise training may have positive additive effects in patients with HFpEF, especially if they are older with concomitant obesity.[73] In addition to caloric restriction, at least 1 study has demonstrated that sodium restriction as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improves ventricular diastolic function and arterial elastance in patients with HFpEF and hypertension.[74] **Antihypertensive therapies** Diuretics, angiotensin receptorâ€“neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) are the preferred pharmacologic interventions if blood pressure is uncontrolled in a patient with HFpEF. The currently recommended blood pressure goal is below 130/80 mm Hg.[12] The nonrandomized Optimize-HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) registry demonstrated improved 30-day mortality and decreased hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared to no diuretic therapy after hospital discharge for heart failure.[75] Bumetanide and torsemide have better bioavailability than furosemide. Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Diuretic resistance is a common problem and may be due to excessive dietary sodium consumption, using medications that negatively affect diuretic action, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or underlying chronic kidney disease. A meta-analysis of 11 trials of 14,262 patients in sinus rhythm, including 244 patients with HFpEF, demonstrated that beta blockers reduce mortality and have beneficial effects.[76] Patients with HFpEF and concomitant coronary artery disease also benefit from beta-blocker administration. The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial of 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and an LVEF of greater than 45% that demonstrated some reduction in hospitalization rates for heart failure.[77] This was particularly true for patients with an LVEF of less than 55% to 60% and those with elevated BNP.[78] A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan, as compared with valsartan, has a tendency to lower the risk of heart failure-related
