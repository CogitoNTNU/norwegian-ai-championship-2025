obtain influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations to limit the risk of secondary or co-infections when unwell with atypical bacterial pneumonia.[104][105] ## Pearls and Other Issues Key considerations in the management and monitoring of atypical bacterial pneumonia include: - Most patients respond with clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours. - The chest x-ray findings lag behind clinical features and may take 6 to 12 weeks to resolve.[42] - If patients fail to improve within 72 hours, another cause should be suspected, such as antibiotic resistance or the development of complications, such as empyema. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of atypical bacterial pneumonia are often challenging due to the often delayed availability of laboratory results, making clinical judgment essential. An interprofessional team, including an emergency department physician, infectious disease consultant, nurse practitioner, internist, radiologist, and pharmacist, is key to effective management. Given the potential delays in diagnosis, treatment should not be postponed if atypical pneumonia is suspected and the patient is not improving. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medication adherence and the importance of having the annual influenza vaccine among at-risk and older patients. Nurses should closely monitor patients for respiratory distress, nutrition, and mental status changes. For outpatient management, an infectious disease nurse should follow up with patients in a clinic to ensure proper recovery. If complications arise, the infectious disease physician should reassess the patient for appropriate management, with radiology involved in evaluating any related complications.[106] To minimize morbidity and mortality, it is essential to monitor patients until complete resolution of symptoms is achieved.[107] Close communication and coordination among the interprofessional team are vital for improving patient outcomes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27355&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27355) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/infectious-disease/atypical-bacterial-pneumonia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27355) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27355/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27355) ## References 1.
