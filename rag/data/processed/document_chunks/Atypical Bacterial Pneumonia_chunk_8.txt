de pointes.[66] Despite these recommendations, clinicians often have challenges in understanding when to use combination therapy without guidelines.[67] Clinician tools such as the CURB-65 or SMART-COP scores and the pneumonia severity index are frequently used to stratify management into outpatient management, admission, or intensive care admission. However, these tools are yet to supplant clinical judgment regarding the appropriate management of patients with pneumonia, including atypical bacterial pneumonia.[49][62][68][69] Well-appearing individuals in whom an atypical organism is suspected can likely be managed with outpatient antibiotics and symptomatic care, while monitoring for potential complications. Treatment failures are common due to antibiotic resistance, poor patient compliance, and inability to tolerate oral medications, among other factors.[1][70] In addition, some patients may have autoimmune conditions, primary respiratory pathology, or obstructing lung lesions/other opacities of non-infective etiology that may obscure consolidation, leading to an incorrect diagnosis. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may have a parapneumonic effusion on the chest x-ray or CT chest.[71][72][73][74][75] If this fluid does not resolve, empyema may develop. Aspiration and fluid drainage are highly recommended if the pH is less than 7.2.[76] In children younger than 5, atypical bacterial pathogens are less common, with the incidence and frequency of atypical pathogens increasing with age.[8] Bacterial isolates may only be cultured less than 15% of the time, and less so for atypical pathogens, given the predominance of viral pathogens in children younger than 5.[77] As such, the evidence for empirical coverage of atypical bacterial pneumonia in children remains uncertain. [70] Of the bacterial causes of pneumonia, typical bacterial pathogens predominate. Therefore, when pneumonia is suspected in children younger than 5, the empirical outpatient treatment is amoxicillin, typically administered for 3 to 10 days.[70][78] The data behind antimicrobial duration are historically arbitrary, and more recent randomized trials suggest shorter durations may be similar in efficacy to longer durations. Duration should instead be guided by clinical status and exclusion of persisting sources of infection, such as empyema or parapneumonic effusions. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and co-trimoxazole have shown efficacy comparable to amoxicillin in children and can be considered alternative antimicrobial therapies.[79] Despite the uncertainty of evidence, the addition of clarithromycin or azithromycin can be considered for atypical bacteria in children if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours.[70] Macrolides are recommended for children older than 5 for 10 days.[77] Children who develop severe disease require parenteral therapy, which may include amoxicillin/clavulanate in addition to macrolides.
