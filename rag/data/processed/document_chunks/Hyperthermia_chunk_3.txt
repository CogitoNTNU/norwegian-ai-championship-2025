also irrigate the bladder with cold saline. More frequent ice pack changes and reapplication of cold water will allow for more rapid cooling.[3][4] One of the most effective cooling methods is a water bath with water at 90 F (26.7 C). Colder temperatures may cause shivering. ## Complications Overall, cooling is a useful intervention that has few complications. The patient's vital signs must be monitored closely during the cooling process. As mentioned, patients should be monitored for shivering and hindering cooling efforts. Critically ill patients may further decompensate during cooling. Additionally, if a patient's body temperature drops below normal (36 C), they will be at risk for the sequelae of hypothermia, including arrhythmias and coagulopathy. An important organ to monitor during the cooling process is the skin. It is susceptible to damage from prolonged exposure to ice. Covering ice packs with a towel or sheet and regularly adjusting the application site will mitigate this risk.[5][6][7][8] ## Clinical Significance Decreasing core body temperature is the most critical intervention in managing heat-related illness and heat stroke. Cooling may also be an adjunct to the usual therapies for numerous conditions that may cause secondary hyperthermia. The techniques described are easy, simple, and effective ways of cooling a patient in the emergency department. They require little training and can be performed by an individual provider. Additionally, they are applicable in many environments. Rapidly identifying patients benefitting from this intervention is the key to effective management.[9][10] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Hyperthermia is not an uncommon presentation to the emergency room. Some of these patients may require systemic cooling to prevent neurological damage. Decreasing core body temperature is the most critical intervention in managing heat-related illness and heat stroke. The cooling is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, emergency department physician, and ICU nurses Cooling may also be an adjunct to the usual therapies for numerous conditions that may cause secondary hyperthermia. Rapidly identifying patients benefitting from this intervention is the key to effective management.[9][10] The outcomes in most patients who are promptly treated are good. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19961&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19961) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/therapeutics/cooling-techniques-for-hyperthermia-cooling-therapy/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=19961) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19961/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19961) [![Image ](/books/NBK459311/bin/Cooling_Techniques_For_Hyperthermia_-01.gif)](/books/NBK459311/figure/article-19961.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459311/figure/article-19961.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Cooling Techniques for Hyperthermia Graphic by E Gregory ## References 1.
