Some examples include ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients. **Objectives:** - Identify risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. - Identify how a patient with acute coronary syndrome might present, and describe the evaluation that should be done. - Describe the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. - Describe the importance of well-coordinated interprofessional teamwork in caring for patients with acute coronary syndrome.

It is a type of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is responsible for one-third of total deaths in people older than 35. Some forms of CHD can be asymptomatic, but ACS is always symptomatic.[1][2][3] ## Etiology ACS is a manifestation of CHD (coronary heart disease) and usually a result of plaque disruption in coronary arteries (atherosclerosis). The common risk factors for the disease are smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, male sex, physical inactivity, family obesity, and poor nutritional practices. Cocaine abuse can also lead to vasospasm. [4][5][6]A family history of early myocardial infarction (55 years of age) is also a high-risk factor. ## Epidemiology CHD affects about 15.5 million in the United States. The American Heart Association estimates a person has a heart attack every 41 seconds. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Chest pain is among the top reasons for emergency department visits. ## Pathophysiology The underlying pathophysiology in ACS is decreased blood flow to part of heart musculature which is usually secondary to plaque rupture and formation of thrombus. Sometimes ACS can be secondary to vasospasm with or without underlying atherosclerosis. The result is decreased blood flow to a part of heart musculature resulting first in
