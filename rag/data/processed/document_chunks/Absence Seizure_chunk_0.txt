Absence seizures are generally seen in children aged 5 to 15 years and occur in multiple genetic generalized epilepsies, including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Atypical absence seizures have been reported in up to 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A classic EEG finding of a 3-Hz spike and wave discharges is found. Absence epilepsy is an electroclinical diagnosis (clinical presentation and EEG findings). While primarily affecting children, absence seizures can persist into adulthood, significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life if left untreated. This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of absence seizures, a condition that often goes unrecognized or misdiagnosed. The clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment options for absence seizures are reviewed. This activity also addresses the unique electroencephalogram (EEG) findings characteristic of absence seizures and the differential diagnosis to distinguish them from other seizure types and nonepileptic events. Participants will gain insights into the latest evidence-based management strategies, including pharmacological interventions and nonpharmacological approaches, tailored to effectively control absence seizures. The role of an interprofessional team in managing this challenging neurological condition is highlighted. **Objectives:** - Evaluate a patient presenting with staring spells for characteristics consistent with absence seizures. - Identify the first-line medications for absence epilepsy and associated adverse effects. - Assess approaches to counsel absence seizure patients and family members on safety precautions. - Collaborate with interprofessional team members to promptly diagnose, evaluate, and treat patients with absence seizures.

Atypical absence seizures have been reported in up to 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Historically, absence epilepsy
