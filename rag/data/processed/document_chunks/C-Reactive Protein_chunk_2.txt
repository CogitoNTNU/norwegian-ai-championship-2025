oozing, bruising, or tenderness. Infection at the venipuncture site is rare. Although other body fluids, such as synovial fluid, may contain CRP, testing these fluids is not a routine practice. CRP quantification is performed using immunoassays or laser nephelometryâ€”methods that are inexpensive, accurate, and rapid. For detecting lower concentrations of CRP (0.3-1.0 mg/L), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) assays are preferred due to greater precision at low levels. The term "high-sensitivity" refers solely to the analytical technique, not to a distinct clinical interpretation or differential diagnosis. Recent advances have introduced reliable point-of-care CRP testing options cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ProciseDx CRP Assay, approved in 2022, delivers quantitative CRP results from serum samples in under 5 minutes using a compact fluorescence-based device.

Innovative approaches, such as integrating paper-based microfluidic immunoassays with smartphones (eg, the CRP-Chip), offer low-cost, rapid testing options suitable for resource-limited environments.[9] ## Indications This test is performed when a physician suspects acute or chronic inflammation, such as in conditions like SLE or rheumatoid arthritis, or when an infection is being considered. The utility of hsCRP for cardiac screening remains debatable. Although some correlation exists between elevated hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk, the test's poor specificity complicates its clinical application. Further evaluation of its role in cardiovascular risk assessment is ongoing.[10][11][12] The FDA has approved several types of CRP assays for clinical use. Conventional CRP assays are typically used to evaluate infection, inflammatory disorders, and tissue injury. HsCRP assays are designed to assess inflammation in individuals who are otherwise healthy. Cardiac CRP (cCRP) assays are indicated for identifying and stratifying individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the future.
