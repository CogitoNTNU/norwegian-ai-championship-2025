of intravenous drug use, often resulting from injecting illicit drug mixtures with contaminated needles. Diagnosing infectious endocarditis can be challenging due to the initially vague symptoms. While right-sided heart valves are most commonly affected, left-sided valves may also be involved in some cases. The tricuspid valve is the valve most frequently affected in individuals who use intravenous drugs. Endocarditis often presents with fever, malaise, and a new murmur. In some patients, recurrent septic pulmonary embolism may be the only presenting feature. The organism most commonly involved in right-sided endocarditis is _Staphylococcus aureus_. In contrast, left-sided endocarditis may be polymicrobial, involving organisms such as _Streptococcus_ , _E. coli_ , _Pseudomonas_ , and _Klebsiella_. Symptoms and signs tend to be more pronounced in left-sided endocarditis compared to right-sided cases. Other infectious manifestations of opioid abuse include recurrent pneumonia, with aspiration pneumonia occurring in some unconscious individuals. Necrotizing fasciitis, another life-threatening complication, often presents with severe pain, fever, and dark, dusky skin with crepitus. The individual may show signs of septic shock. Aggressive resuscitation and immediate surgical debridement can be life-saving. **Musculoskeletal and Neurologic Sequelae** Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively common complication of opioid overdose that may occur even without compartment syndrome. Opioids are likewise known to increase the risk of seizures, particularly drugs like propoxyphene, meperidine, pentazocine, intravenous fentanyl, and heroin. The individual may present with a prolonged seizure, which may result from CNS hypoperfusion and hypoxia or from intracranial injury due to a fall. **Narcotic Bowel Syndrome** Narcotic bowel syndrome is a type of opiate-induced bowel pathology characterized by frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe abdominal pain that worsens with escalating or continued opiate doses. This syndrome typically occurs in individuals without prior bowel pathology and represents a maladaptive response. Narcotic bowel syndrome may also be associated with intermittent vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation. Eating tends to aggravate the symptoms, which can last for days or weeks. Anorexia may result in weight loss, and delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit are delayed. The syndrome is often mistaken for bowel obstruction. The key to diagnosis lies in recognizing that continued and escalating opiate doses worsen abdominal pain rather than provide relief. Treatment for narcotic bowel syndrome involves psychotherapy, as well as tapering or discontinuing the opioid. Successful treatment depends on developing a strong patient-physician relationship and trust, gradually withdrawing the narcotic, and using nonpharmacological treatments to manage pain. **Withdrawal Reaction** Withdrawal symptoms following cessation of
