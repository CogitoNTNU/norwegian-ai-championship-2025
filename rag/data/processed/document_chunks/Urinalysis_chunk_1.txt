each year due to rising risk factors, particularly high-animal protein and high-salt diets, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity.

The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has also been increasing worldwide. Determining the true incidence and prevalence of CKD is challenging due to the asymptomatic nature of early to moderate stages. Globally, CKD accounted for 2,968,600 (1%) disability-adjusted life-years and 2,546,700 (1%-3%) life-years lost in 2012.[4] The rising incidence of CKD is due to increased risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as longer life expectancies, as GFR naturally declines with age.

Pheochromocytomas originate from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, and their clinical manifestations result from excess catecholamine release. Paragangliomas arise from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. While paragangliomas are not always symptomatic, they typically present with symptoms related to catecholamine excess when they do. Additionally, paragangliomas can cause symptoms based on their location, mass effect, or bony erosions. Paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are often grouped together for statistical purposes, with a combined incidence estimated at 0.7 to 1.0 cases per 100,000 person-years. Another review found that 0.3% of patients tested for secondary hypertension were diagnosed with pheochromocytoma.[5] Thus, even among patients at higher risk for pheochromocytoma, the incidence remains very low outside of inherited endocrine disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, neurofibromatosis type I, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

These compounds have a long half-life and are excreted in the urine, making them more suitable for measurement than catecholamines. Elevated plasma metanephrines are considered more specific than elevated urine metanephrines. Additionally, the level of increased metanephrine correlates with tumor size. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Renal Calculi, Nephrolithiasis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28339)" and "[Chronic Kidney Disease](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28357)," for details on the pathophysiology of nephrolithiasis and CKD. The European Society of Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry or electrochemical detection methods over other techniques. Literature reports that urine metanephrines' sensitivity ranges from 86% to 97%, while specificity ranges from 69% to 95%.[7] A key consideration is that, due to the frequent testing and the low prevalence of true pheochromocytoma
