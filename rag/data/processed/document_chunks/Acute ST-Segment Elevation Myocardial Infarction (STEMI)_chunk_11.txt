with an overall mortality rate greater than 70%.[65][66] Prompt surgery reduces the mortality rate in both conditions. Acute mitral regurgitation following a myocardial infarction is most commonly due to ischemic papillary muscle displacement, left ventricular dilatation, or rupture of the papillary muscle or chordae. In STEMI, the degree of mitral regurgitation is usually severe and associated with a 30-day survival of 24%.[67] Inflammation of the pericardium, known as pericarditis, and pericardial effusion resulting from pericardial injury are collectively referred to as postcardiac injury syndrome. This syndrome includes conditions such as postmyocardial infarction, pericarditis (Dressler syndrome), postpericardiotomy syndrome, and posttraumatic pericarditis. Even minor injuries, like those from PCI, cardiac implantable electronic device placement, or radiofrequency ablation, can provoke cardiac injury. These conditions share a common trigger of pericardial or pleural damage, leading to a pleuropericardial syndrome characterized by pericarditis with pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.[68] ## Pearls and Other Issues Critical considerations in managing STEMI include the following: - Chest pain or discomfort: This symptom is the primary trigger for the diagnostic and treatment processes in acute coronary syndrome. - Coordination between emergency medical services and hospitals: Effective STEMI management relies on the seamless coordination between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals, facilitated by standardized written protocols. EMS should notify the PCI center as soon as a reperfusion strategy is decided, and the patient should be directly transferred to the PCI center, bypassing the emergency department. - Invasive strategy: An invasive approach is advised for patients with ACS due to the condition's time-sensitive nature. Immediate invasive intervention is strongly recommended for STEMI. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes A door-to-balloon time of less than 90 minutes is the goal of a PCI-capable facility. This parameter is one of the core measures of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.[69] The door-to-balloon time is the time between the patient's arrival in the emergency department and the crossing of the culprit lesion by a guide wire in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Teamwork between EMS, emergency department physicians, and interventional cardiologists sets the groundwork for optimal door-to-balloon times. The median door-to-balloon time in 2010 was 64 minutes, with 91% of patients receiving PCI in under 90 minutes and 70% in under 75 minutes.[70] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17173&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17173) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-heart-attack-with-ecg-changes/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17173) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17173/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17173) [![ ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction on Electrocardiogram](/books/NBK532281/bin/12_Lead_EKG_ST_Elevation_tracing_color_coded.gif)](/books/NBK532281/figure/article-17173.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure")
