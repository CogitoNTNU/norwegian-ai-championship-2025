acute coronary syndromes (ACS), this entity is still associated with a relevant clinical burden.[2][3][4] In this context, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is central to the diagnostic process and treatment allocation, as early diagnosis allows for a timely reperfusion strategy. Though differentiation between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is pivotal, over the years, several electrocardiographic patterns associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events have been described.[2][3][5][6][4] The de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is a finding that, in a proper setting, is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. This electrocardiogram finding consists of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall, peaked positive T waves. The pattern is considered to be equivalent to an ST elevation as a clinical indication of myocardial infarction. Therefore, clinical recognition of this finding and the additional evaluation it should precipitate is critical to improving patient outcomes. Emergent consultation with a cardiologist should be undertaken when the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is observed to allow for timely cardiac catheterization and primary percutaneous coronary intervention, if appropriate, to ensure appropriate reperfusion as per ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines.[2][5][7][4] ## Etiology The de Winter ECG pattern is associated with occlusion of the coronary arteries, most often the LAD. However, cases involving other coronary arteries (eg, the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery) have also been described.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Most cases reported occlusion due to atherosclerotic disease in line with other presentations of myocardial infarction,[5][12][5][8] though this pattern has also been described as due to a thromboembolic event.[13][5][12][5][8][13] The de Winter ECG pattern has also been noted without an acute epicardial occlusion after a percutaneous coronary intervention, hypothesized as associated with impaired microvascular perfusion.[12] ## Epidemiology The de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is an infrequent presentation, reported to occur in 2% to 3.4% of patients with anterior myocardial infarction.[8][10][14][15] Because the de Winter electrocardiogram pattern relates to patients presenting with ACS, the risk factors associated with this pattern are similar to those of ischemic heart disease (eg, increased age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity).[1][2][3][14] In some studies, male patients were more likely to present with this pattern, and some authors have reported that individuals with this pattern tend to be younger than those who present with an anterior STEMI.[14][15][10][15] ## Pathophysiology Though the specific pathophysiology associated
