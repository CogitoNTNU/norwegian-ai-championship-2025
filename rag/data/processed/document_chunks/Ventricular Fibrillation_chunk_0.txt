This includes a subset of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), and ventricular flutter. Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is used to define all tachyarrhythmia with QRS complex duration greater than 0.12 seconds. VF is a WCT caused by irregular electrical activity and characterized by a ventricular rate of usually greater than 300 with discrete QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of VF and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. **Objectives:** - Describe the causes of VF. - Recall the pathophysiology of VF. - Summarize the treatment options for VF. - Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected with VF.

This includes a subset of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), and ventricular flutter. Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is used to define all tachyarrhythmia with QRS complex duration greater than 0.12 seconds. VF is a WCT caused by irregular electrical activity and characterized by a ventricular rate of usually greater than 300 with discrete QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). QRS morphology in VF varies in shape, amplitude, and duration with a prominent irregular rhythm.[1] VF is an extremely dangerous rhythm significantly compromising cardiac output and ultimately leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). VF has been identified in nearly 70% of cardiac arrest patients. Without treatment, the condition is fatal within minutes. The rates of survival for VF patients outside the hospitals have increased slightly but many continue to have residual anoxic brain damage and neurological deficits. ## Etiology VF is often linked to underlying structural heart disease. Three percent to 12% of cases of myocardial infarction (MI) develop VF during the acute phase.[2] MI patients with complete coronary occlusion
