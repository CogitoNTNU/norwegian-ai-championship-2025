where time is crucial, one can consider using a carbon monoxide oximeter. Unfortunately, such devices are not commonly found in modern hospitals. Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen (about 230 to 270 times higher), leading to a shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve towards the left. This results in reduced oxygen delivery to the body's tissues, which can manifest as mental confusion, agitation, nausea, dizziness, and headachesâ€”all indicative of carbon monoxide poisoning. Any patient with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning should immediately receive 100% oxygen. Administration of normobaric 100% oxygen can reduce the half-life of carbon monoxide to 40 to 80 minutes from 240 to 320 minutes, thus expediting recovery. After the carboxyhemoglobin level falls below 10%, stopping administering 100% oxygen is safe. However, monitoring the patient for roughly 24 hours is crucial to ensure they're not experiencing any respiratory issues. Patients with a carboxyhemoglobin level >20% should be considered for intubation and mechanical ventilation to expedite carbon monoxide elimination further and improve tissue oxygenation. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation with accompanying carbon monoxide poisoning should receive 100% FiO2 until carboxyhemoglobin levels normalize to expedite dissociation with hemoglobin. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should also be considered in severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.[1][6][7][8] ## Preparation **Airway Management** When dealing with a burn patient requiring anesthesia in an acute setting, conducting a thorough airway assessment is crucial to detect any indications of airway edema that could lead to a complex airway challenge. Decreased mandibular mobility from burn contractures or glottic edema from airway swelling may make laryngoscopy difficult. When faced with a suspected difficult airway due to thermal injury to supraglottic structures, the most widely accepted and safe approach is to use fiberoptic intubation. This technique involves the application of topical anesthetic and minimal general anesthetics. If fiberoptic intubation is chosen, ketamine-induced sedation/anesthesia can create ideal intubation conditions due to the maintenance of pharyngeal muscle tone. Ketamine is associated with preserving hemodynamic stability, hypercapnia responses, and decreased airway resistance, making it an ideal agent for individuals with supraglottic swelling. Utilizing anesthetic agents that disrupt airway tones, such as propofol and paralytic agents, may further obstruct the airway creating much more difficult intubating conditions.[1][3] **Intravascular Access** Individuals who have suffered severe burns may face challenges when receiving intravenous treatment due to the damage caused to common access areas such as the neck, limbs, and groin. Additionally, edema resulting from the burn
