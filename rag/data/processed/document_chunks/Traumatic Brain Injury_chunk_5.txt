traumatic injuries who is also on an anticoagulant will likely need a full lab panel. When clinically indicated, common labs include a CBC, CMP, coagulation profile (PT and PTT), and a type and screen. The initial imaging study of choice is a CT scan of the brain without contrast, as it is often readily available in just about any hospital setting and is rapidly obtainable. Skull X-rays are not recommended unless assessing foreign bodies, gunshots, or stab wounds due to their poor diagnostic value. MRI can be helpful but takes much longer to obtain than a head CT. MRI may be indicated in follow-up for head injuries but is not used as the initial evaluation. A CT scan of the brain is advocated for patients with moderate to severe head injury as this helps rule out or diagnose the majority of intracranial emergencies like subdural, epidural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Those suffering from DAI may have normal initial CT scans, but some may reveal small punctate hemorrhages to white matter tracts. MRI imaging is best used to help diagnose DAI, especially diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and gradient-recalled echo (GRD) MRI.[30] For adults with mild head injury (mild TBI) and are at low risk for intracranial injuries, there are two commonly used and externally validated scoring algorithms that help guide when to obtain a head CT scan after a head injury.[31][32][33][34][35] These are the New Orleans Criteria (NOC) and Canadian CT Head Injury/Trauma Rules (CCHR). For patients with minor head trauma and a GCS of 15, both rules have a 100% sensitivity in predicting the need for neurosurgical intervention with the CCHR, resulting in lower CT rates (52% vs. 88%) and being more specific (50.6% vs. 12.7%).[34] Similar to the CCHR and NOC, the PECARN head injury rule has a 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in ruling out clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) in the pediatric population under two years of age. In those over two, the rules had a 96.8% sensitivity and negative predictive value of 99.95% for ruling out ciTBI but had a 100% sensitivity in predicting those requiring neurosurgical intervention.[36][37][36] If any of the criteria are met, a CT scan of the brain may be warranted. **New Orleans Criteria** - Headache - Vomiting (any) - Age > 60 years - Drug or alcohol intoxication - Seizure - Trauma visible above clavicles - Short-term memory deficits
