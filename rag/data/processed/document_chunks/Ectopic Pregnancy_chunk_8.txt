as much as possible, if desired. Therefore, interventions should be tailored to optimize the patient's preferences for future reproductive outcomes.[3] The patient's hemodynamic stability directs the initial management approach for an ectopic pregnancy. Any patient exhibiting signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be urgently transferred for surgical intervention. If the ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed early, the patient remains hemodynamically stable, and the affected fallopian tube is intact, treatment options include medical management with intramuscular methotrexate or surgical options, eg, salpingostomy (removal of the ectopic pregnancy while preserving the fallopian tube) or salpingectomy (removal of part or all of the affected fallopian tube).[3] The choice between medical and surgical management depends on clinical findings, ultrasound results, serum β-hCG levels, and patient preference. In patients with an initial β-hCG level of \<200 mIU/mL, 88% of ectopic pregnancies spontaneously resolved with expectant management. Therefore, expectant management, though seldom used, may be considered in select patients who are asymptomatic with low and declining β-hCG levels and who are accepting of the risks for tubal rupture or hemorrhage.[1][6] Medical or surgical treatment should be initiated; however, if the patient begins to have pain, persistent or increasing β-hCG levels, or begins to show signs of tubal rupture.[6][1] **Medical management** Though surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy provides definitive treatment, fertility rates are higher in patients who have undergone medical management with methotrexate. Therefore, for appropriate candidates who desire to maintain their fertility options, methotrexate may be preferred.[3] Methotrexate, a folate antagonist that disrupts rapidly dividing cells, is the only medication used for medical management of ectopic pregnancy.[1][4] Medical management is successful in approximately 70% to 95% of patients, though the efficacy decreases as initial β-hCG levels increase.[4] Absolute contraindications to methotrexate include: - Hemodynamic instability - Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia - Immunodeficiency - Ruptured ectopic pregnancy - Renal or hepatic dysfunction - Unreliable follow-up - Active pulmonary or peptic ulcer disease - Breastfeeding Relative contraindications to methotrexate include: - Fetal cardiac activity - Serum β-hCG levels > 5000 mIU/mL or adenxal mass > 4 cm in diameter - Blood transfusion refusal Before administrating methotrexate, patients should be assessed for the presence of these contraindications, including a complete blood count and metabolic panel.[4] Methotrexate can be administered via different protocols, including single-dose, 2-dose, and multidose regimens. The single-dose protocol has the least adverse effects, while the 2-dose protocol is more effective, having a lower treatment failure rate,
