circulation as the unprocessed precursor protein.[8] When the effects of this peptide are evaluated on vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and myocytes, this peptide did not appear to have any biological activity.[10] The C-type natriuretic peptide is synthesized primarily in the central nervous system. It is also found in vascular endothelial cells and may play a role in the local regulation of vascular tone.[11] Unlike ANP and BNP, the human gene encoding CNP, _NPPC_ , is not located on chromosome 1 but on chromosome 2. In normal human subjects, the mean CNP concentration is very low (1 fmol/mL).[12] It is elevated in patients with heart failure, although to a much lower extent than ANP and BNP. The clearance of CNP-22 in human plasma is very rapid, with a calculated half-life of 2.6 minutes.[13] The natriuretic peptide system consists of 3 receptors: natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A), natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B), and natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C).[14] The human NPR-A gene is located on chromosome 1q21–22 and consists of 22 exons and 21 introns within 16 kilobases. The human NPR-B gene is located on chromosome 9p12–21, and the murine version, _Npr2_ , is located on chromosome 4. The human NPR-C gene is located on chromosome 5p13–14 and contains 8 exons and 7 introns spanning more than 65 kilobases.[15] The natriuretic peptide receptors NPR-A and NPR-B catalyze the synthesis of a classic intracellular second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate or cGMP. cGMP binds to proteins such as cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-binding phosphodiesterases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.[16] NPR-C controls the concentrations of NPs through receptor-mediated internalization and degradation. The NPR-A to NPR-C ratio plays a role in regulating the biological activity of natriuretic peptides (NP).[17] ## Pathophysiology BNP is a 32–amino acid peptide hormone with a molecular weight of 3472 daltons.[6] The molecule consists of an N-terminal tail of 9 amino acids, a C-terminal tail of 6 amino acids, and a 17-member ring closed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues. Eleven amino acids found in the ring are conserved across the family of natriuretic peptides.[18] BNP binds to natriuretic peptide receptors A and C, causing the loss of water and electrolytes, vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (RAAS).[19] BNP is cleared from the circulation by neutral endopeptidases. The first two amino acids from the N-terminal sequence (serine and proline) are removed by dipeptidyl peptidase IV very soon after BNP is released
