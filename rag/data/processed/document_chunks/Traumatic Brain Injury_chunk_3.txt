nerve cell. This influx of ions activates various enzymes, which then degrade cell membranes and structure, leading to free radicals, cell death, and edema.[23] According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) are the prime buffers against any extra volume increment inside the rigid skull.[26] Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) may be estimated by measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) and the mean arterial pressure (MAP), CPP=MAP-ICP. ICP is a function of the relative amounts of CBV, brain parenchyma, and CSF in the inelastic space of the cranium. When raised, ICP overrides the compensatory displacement of the CSF and disrupts the cerebral autoregulatory capacity, leading to decreased brain compliance and a fall in compensatory reserve. This triggers sequential cascades of herniation syndrome, each showing salient neurological and radiological characteristics.[27] Subfalcine herniation leads to contralateral lower limb weakness due to pericallosal and callosomarginal vessel compression. Uncal herniation causes ipsilateral anisocoria with contralateral motor weakness. Furthermore, the torsion on the diencephalon alters the sensorium following distortion of the reticular activating system and obliteration of CSF pathways. The transtentorial herniation shows decorticate and decerebrate posturing alongside loss of brainstem reflexes. The patient may develop Cheyne-Stoke breathing followed by hyperventilation, ataxia, apnoea, and eventually respiratory arrest from tonsillar herniation.[27] ## History and Physical **History** Important historical features, including the mechanism of injury and the presence of loss of consciousness (and, if so, for how long), are essential components in the initial evaluation. In addition to the mechanism of injury, the clinician must understand the patient's past medical history and whether or not there is any use of any antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents. Symptoms of TBI may be nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, headaches, tinnitus, visual changes, dizziness, "foggy" feeling, or confusion. In the longer term, many patients struggle with ongoing post-concussive symptoms, including dizziness, balance problems, cognitive difficulties, memory deficits, emotional lability, anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties, delusions, hallucinations, vision changes, and headaches. **Exam** It is important to review initial vital signs in patients following a closed head injury. In patients with increased intracranial pressure of >20 mmHg (normal is \<15 mmHg), the Cushing triad, a combination of hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular or decreased respirations, may be present. Assuming that the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation are intact, the patient should be evaluated using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), assessing for eye-opening, verbal responses, and motor responses. The minimum score is 3, and
