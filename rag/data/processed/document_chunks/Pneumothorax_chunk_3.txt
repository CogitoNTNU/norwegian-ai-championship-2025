tall, thin-built young males, particularly those who smoke.[20] The condition has a high recurrence rate, with 20% to 60% of patients experiencing a recurrence within the first 3 years following their initial episode. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in individuals with underlying lung disease, resulting in significant variation in its epidemiology. Among patients with COPD, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax accounts for 50% to 70% of cases.[21] In 11% of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax instances, bacterial pneumonia was identified as the causative factor. In addition, pneumothorax is a known complication in 5% to 10% of pneumocystis pneumonia cases, further emphasizing the role of infections in its development.[22] ## History and Physical The clinical presentation of pneumothorax varies depending on its size and etiology. Some patients may be asymptomatic, and the condition may be diagnosed incidentally during the imaging performed for an unrelated reason.[23] The most common symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath, reported in 64% to 85% of cases.[24] Chest pain is typically sudden, unilateral (though rarely bilateral), sharp or stabbing, pleuritic, and may radiate to the ipsilateral shoulder or arm. The severity of symptoms varies, depending on the extent of the lung collapse. In cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, symptoms may gradually improve after 24 hours, possibly due to the spontaneous reabsorption of air from the pleural space. Other possible symptoms include anxiety and cough, though these are less common. Physical examination findings depend on the size of the pneumothorax. In small pneumothoraces, the exam may be entirely normal. However, the affected side may have absent breath sounds in larger pneumothoraces. Many patients experiencing a first-time spontaneous pneumothorax may delay seeking medical attention for several days. Hypoxia (oxygen saturation below 90%) is rare, occurring in only 3% to 11% of cases.[25] **Tension Pneumothorax** Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention.[26] In addition to chest pain and shortness of breath, patients with tension pneumothorax exhibit hemodynamic compromise, which can include profound hypoxia and hypotension. The pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax involves the gradual accumulation of air in the pleural space caused by a one-valve effect that prevents air from escaping. The increasing intrapleural pressure leads to a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, compression of the vena cava, and decreased cardiac output, ultimately resulting in severe hypotension and hypoxia. On physical examination, classic findings of tension pneumothorax include absent breath sounds on the affected hemithorax, tracheal deviation to
