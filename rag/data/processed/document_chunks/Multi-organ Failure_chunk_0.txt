This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of acute liver failure. In addition, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with acute liver failure. **Objectives:** - Describe the etiology of acute liver failure and cite the most common causes. - Review how a patient with acute liver failure might present. - Outline how to evaluate a patient for acute liver failure. - Explain why the management of acute liver failure should involve a well-integrated interprofessional team.

Though it has high morbidity and mortality, its overall survival has improved through intensive care management and emergency liver transplantation advancements.[1][2][3] A high index of suspicion, early referral to a specialist liver transplantation center, and adequate supportive management remain the cornerstone for the management of ALF. Future better understanding and knowledge of the pathophysiology of liver injury and management of multi-organ failure will help improve outcomes. ALF is defined as the development of severe acute liver injury with encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (INR of 1.5 or higher) in a patient without cirrhosis or preexisting liver disease and with an illness of fewer than 26 weeks duration.[4][5] ## Etiology An extensive workup for the etiology of ALF is recommended, as this guides directed therapy and helps determine the outcome. Viral hepatitis and drug-induced hepatitis are the 2 most common causes of ALF worldwide. Other causes include hypoxia-induced liver injury, acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, Wilson disease, mushroom ingestion, sepsis, autoimmune hepatitis, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet) syndrome, heatstroke, and malignant infiltration (with metastasis from breast cancer, small cell lung cancer,
