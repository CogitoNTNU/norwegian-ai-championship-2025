activation. This role has been the target of study in pulmonary tuberculosis infection in which mice deficient in the enzyme showed increased mycobacterial counts and decreased inflammatory response to infection. **Adipose-Specific PLA** Although designated as adipose-specific PLA, the enzyme expresses throughout many tissues, with the highest levels of expression occurring in adipocytes. The currently studied roles of the enzyme in the regulation of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation make it a viable target for further research on obesity. **Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase** As previously mentioned, researchers have studied the role of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase as playing a role in atherogenesis of blood vessels. This process has shown increased expression of the enzyme in association with oxidized LDL and inflammation, promoting the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. This studied function of the enzyme makes it a potential pharmaceutical target to prevent the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Another studied pathophysiological mechanism involving platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase includes neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This disease results in intestinal necrosis of premature infants. Low levels of the enzyme, along with the accumulation of platelet-activating factor in newborns, correlate with the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest that the administration of exogenous forms of the enzyme may help to improve outcomes in NEC.[1][6][7][8][9] ## Clinical Significance **Secretory PLA** Due to the well-known significance of secretory PLA in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory disease processes, attempts at synthesizing inhibitors of the enzyme have been underway for quite some time for the treatment of asthma and atherosclerosis in relation with cardiovascular diseases. Broad-spectrum inhibitors of the enzyme, such as varespladib, have been shown to cause a substantial decrease in the size of atherosclerotic lesions and an increase in HDL in mice. These results indicate that the enzyme remains a viable target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, and further research is needed to evaluate safety and efficacy in humans. Other research targets related to the enzyme may be shifted towards upstream or downstream enzymes in the same pathway to achieve similar results, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). **Cytosolic PLA** Cytosolic PLA has received much attention as a target for pharmaceutical drugs being the most potent PLA enzyme studied as playing a pivotal role in inflammatory disease pathogenesis. A wide variety of cytosolic PLA inhibitors have been developed and studied regarding their efficacy in treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory-mediated hyperalgesia.
