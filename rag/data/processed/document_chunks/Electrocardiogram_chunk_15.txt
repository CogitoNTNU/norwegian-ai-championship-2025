and strategies to improve system-related issues to drive optimal patient outcomes.[62][63][64] [Level 5] ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions Continuous EKG monitoring is one of the current technologies used in the emergency department, intensive, post-anesthesia, and cardiac care units. Often, nurses are the first care responders in these hospital settings. The first interaction of the EKG view puts great responsibility on the nurses in managing technical aspects of the EKG monitoring and decision-making on the clinical grounds with information received from the monitor. The current practice includes that nurses initially interpret the EKG, gather data, and promptly notify the physician-in-charge to ensure an appropriate management plan.[65] ## Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring Among the healthcare providers in a hospital setting, especially in intensive and cardiac care units where round-the-clock monitoring of critical patients is required, nurses play a very crucial role in cardiac monitoring. It is the nurse's responsibility to assess the patient's clinical condition, monitor, and ensure that an excellent quality of care is delivered. The nurses' should monitor the continuous EKG monitoring very carefully and have competency in initial interpretation. Their knowledge about correct EKG leads placement, analysis, and thrombolytic treatment in acute coronary syndrome patients have significant implications for reducing morbidity and mortality.[66] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20969&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20969) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/diagnostics/electrocardiogram-ecg/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20969) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20969/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20969) [![Image ](/books/NBK549803/bin/EKG.gif)](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Figure 1: Normal EKG showing P waves (green arrows), QRS complex (blue arrows), and T waves (red arrows) Contributed by Yasar Sattar, MD [![Image ](/books/NBK549803/bin/atrialfibri.gif)](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f2/?report=objectonly) Atrial fibrillation Image courtesy S Bhimji MD [![Image ](/books/NBK549803/bin/third__degree__HB.gif)](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f3/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f3/?report=objectonly) Third degree heart block Image courtesy S Bhimji MD [![Image ](/books/NBK549803/bin/left__atrial__enlarge1.gif)](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f4/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f4/?report=objectonly) Left atrial enlargement Image courtesy S Bhimji MD [![Image ](/books/NBK549803/bin/Premature__ventricular__contract.gif)](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f5/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK549803/figure/article-20969.image.f5/?report=objectonly) Premature ventricular contractions Image courtesy S Bhimji MD ## References 1.
