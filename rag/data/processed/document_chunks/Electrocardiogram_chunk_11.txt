Conduction system disorders can cause the right bundle branch block, but it may be present as a standard variant in specific individuals. The left bundle branch block is represented on the ECG by a widened QRS complex greater than 0.12 seconds, broad or notched R wave with prolonged upstroke in the leads V5, V6, I, and aVL, along with ST-segment depression and T wave inversion, and reciprocal changes in leads V1 and V2. Usually, a left-axis deviation is also present. The left bundle branch usually signifies an underlying pathology, such as degenerative disease of the conduction system or ischemic heart disease.[42] **QRS Complex** It represents ventricular depolarization as current passes down the AV node. A standard QRS complex has a duration of less than three small squares (under 120 ms, usually 60 to 100 ms). A prolonged QRS may indicate hyperkalemia or bundle branch block. Conversely, a premature ventricular contraction or a ventricular rhythm can be associated with a wide QRS. **Septal Q-Wave** Q-wave often appears as a tiny negative deflection in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. It represents the depolarization of the interventricular septum. Its amplitude is not bigger than 0.1 mV, so septal depolarization is not always visible on the ECG. Pathological Q-waves on ECG can signify an old infarct. A Q-wave duration greater than 40 milliseconds (one small box), depth greater than 1 mm, or a size greater than 25% of the QRS complex amplitude is pathologic.[43] **R-Wave** It is the tallest wave of the QRS complex, representing the electrical stimulus as it passes down the ventricles during depolarization. The R-wave progressively increases in amplitude, moving right to the left in the precordial leads, and is called R-wave progression. Lead V1 has the smallest R wave, and lead V5 has the largest. A reduced R-wave progression has several causes, including prior anteroseptal MI, left ventricular hypertrophy, inaccurate lead placement, etc.[44] **S-Wave** It represents the final depolarization of the Purkinje fibers. It is any downward deflection after R-wave. It may not be present in all ECG leads. S-wave is most significant in V1 and progressively becomes smaller to no S-wave in the lead V6. **T-Wave** It represents ventricular repolarization. Its morphology is highly susceptible to cardiac and noncardiac influences like (hormonal and neurological). It is usually positive in leads with tall R-waves (upward deflection). The suggested criteria for the typical T wave include the size of one-eighth
