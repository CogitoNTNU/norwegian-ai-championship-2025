importance of their hypertensive medication and should regularly follow up with their obstetrician. **Eclampsia Prevention** Primary and secondary preventative strategies have been recommended to decrease the occurrence of eclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (60 to 150 mg daily) is a primary prevention of eclampsia, focused on stopping the disease before it starts. This intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 10% to 15%. Secondary prevention consists of early disease detection and mitigation of adverse events. Strategies for the secondary prevention of eclampsia include weekly monitoring of patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, including blood pressure measurements, laboratory studies, fetal growth measurements, blood pressure regulation, timely delivery, and magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis. Magnesium sulfate is also utilized to prevent recurrent seizures and reduce the risk of maternal death. While the exact mechanisms of magnesium sulfate are unclear, it is believed to work by acting as a vasodilator, protecting the blood-brain barrier, reducing cerebral edema, and functioning as a central anticonvulsant.[11] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Eclampsia is a severe medical condition that demands swift diagnosis and intervention to minimize risks for the mother and the unborn child. Effective management of eclampsia requires the coordinated efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, with each member playing a critical role. Clinicians and advanced clinicians must recognize and promptly address the signs of eclampsia, particularly in emergency settings where rapid intervention is crucial, especially during active seizures. Nurses are responsible for closely monitoring patients and promptly relaying any changes in the patient’s condition to clinicians, ensuring that timely interventions (eg, administering anticonvulsant medication) are initiated. Communication between emergency clinicians and obstetricians is also essential, particularly when emergent delivery is necessary to manage the condition and safeguard maternal and fetal health. Pharmacists contribute by reviewing and verifying medication dosages, ensuring no dangerous drug interactions, and collaborating with clinicians to adjust treatments. Seamless communication across all healthcare professionals—including nurses, clinicians, pharmacists, and other support staff—is fundamental to ensuring patient safety and enhancing outcomes. In this patient-centered approach, all care team members must remain focused on the well-being of both the mother and child, providing coordinated, efficient care that leads to better overall team performance and patient outcomes in cases of eclampsia. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27632&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27632) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/womens-health/eclampsia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27632) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27632/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27632) ## References 1.
