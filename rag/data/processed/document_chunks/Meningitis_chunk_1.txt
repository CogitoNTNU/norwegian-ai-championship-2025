based on CSF pleocytosis, indicated by an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 5 cells/mm³.[1] Aseptic meningitis is a prevalent and generally benign inflammatory disorder affecting the meninges.[2] Viruses, such as herpes simplex \_\_ virus type 2 (HSV-2), enteroviruses, and arboviruses are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis.[1][2][3] However, aseptic meningitis can also be triggered by diverse factors, including infections caused by mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes, parameningeal infections, medications, and malignancies. Notably, aseptic and viral meningitis are not interchangeable, highlighting the wide array of potential causes. The clinical manifestations of aseptic meningitis can vary significantly based on the affected individual's underlying cause and immune status. Patients with deficient humoral immunity, including neonates and individuals with agammaglobulinemia, are particularly at risk for negative outcomes in cases of aseptic meningitis.[1][2][4] ## Etiology The causes of aseptic meningitis can be broadly classified into infectious and noninfectious origins. Despite progress in diagnostic methods, only 30% to 65% of cases reveal a precise cause.[5] Cases without identified causes are termed idiopathic.[1] Infectious causes of aseptic meningitis include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, with viruses being the predominant agents.[2] Among viral causes, enteroviruses (such as coxsackie and enteric cytopathic human orphan [ECHO] viruses) account for over half of the cases, followed by HSV-2, West Nile virus, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).[2][5] Other viruses associated with aseptic meningitis include respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus), mumps virus, arbovirus, HIV, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.[2][5][6] Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections leading to aseptic meningitis are less common than viral infections. Bacterial causes may arise from partially treated meningitis, parameningeal infections (such as epidural abscess and mastoiditis), _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , endocarditis, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , _Treponema pallidum,_ and leptospirosis. Fungal infections can be attributed to _Candida_ , _Cryptococcus neoformans_ , _Histoplasma capsulatum_ , _Coccidioides immitis_ , and _Blastomyces dermatitides_. Parasitic causes of aseptic meningitis include _Toxoplasma gondii_ , naegleria, neurocysticercosis, trichinosis, and _Hartmannella_.[7][8] Regarding the noninfectious causes of aseptic meningitis, these etiologies can be categorized into 3 main groups:[1] - Systemic diseases involving meningeal inflammation, such as sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis - Drug-induced aseptic meningitis is most commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (sulfamides, penicillins), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and monoclonal antibodies - Neoplastic meningitis is linked to either metastasis from solid cancers or lymphoma/leukemia. Aseptic meningitis triggered by specific vaccines has been documented, notably following immunizations such as measles,
