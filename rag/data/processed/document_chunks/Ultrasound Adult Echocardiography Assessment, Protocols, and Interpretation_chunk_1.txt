valve disease and patent ductus arteriosus. **Apical 4 Chamber View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle - Valves identified in this view: mitral and tricuspid valve - This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the inferior septal wall and anterolateral wall of the left ventricle, mitral, and tricuspid valve disease. See **Image.** Apical Four-Chamber View on Transthoracic Echocardiography. **Apical 5 Chamber View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, right ventricle, and aorta - Valves identified in this view: mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve - This view provides additional information on the Left ventricle outflow tract, aortic valve, and aortic root compared to the 4-chamber view. **Apical 2 Chamber View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium and left ventricle - Valves identified in this view: mitral valve - This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the inferior wall and anterior wall of the left ventricle and mitral valve disease. See **Image.** Apical Two-Chamber View on Transthoracic Echocardiography. **Apical Parasternal Long-axis View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, and aorta - Valves identified in this view: mitral valve and aortic valve - This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the anterior septal wall and the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle. In this view, mitral valve and aortic valve disease are identifiable. See **Image.** Apical Parasternal Long-Axis View on Transthoracic Echocardiography. **Subcostal Coronal View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle - Valves identified in this view: mitral and tricuspid valve - This view helps diagnose interatrial septal defect, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade. **Subcostal Saggital view** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: right atrium, inferior vena cava, hepatic vein, and descending aorta - This view helps in assessing the fluid status of the patient. **Suprasternal Noch View** - **Structures** - Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, aortic arch, brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and right pulmonary artery - This view helps diagnose aorta diseases such as aortic dissection and coarctation of the aorta. In this view, a congenital heart defect, patent ductus arteriosus, can be identified.[4] ## Indications **Appropriate
