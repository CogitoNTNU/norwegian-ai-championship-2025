Willem Einthoven first invented it in 1902. An EKG is an integral part of the initial evaluation of a patient suspected of having a cardiac-related problem. This activity reviews the basic anatomy and electrical conduction system of the heart, illustrates the indications of ECG, and outlines the preparation, technique, and clinical significance. The article also highlights inter-professional teamwork and collaboration to enhance the delivery of quality care to patients. **Objectives:** - Explain the indications for obtaining an ECG. - Describe the procedure for obtaining an ECG. - Review the clinical significance of ECG. - Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance ECG and improve patient outcomes.

The word ECG derives from the German language. In German, it is elektro-kardiographie. In 1902, the Dutch physician Einthovan invented ECG, and his tremendous input in clinical studies for about ten years led to full recognition of the clinical potential of the technique.[1] Many arrhythmias and ECG changes associated with angina and atherosclerosis were identified by 1910. William Einthoven was named the "father of electrocardiography" and was awarded Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1924 for his hard work that laid the foundation of the most fundamental technique for investigating heart disorders. ECG was soon recognized as a robust screening and clinical diagnostic tool, and today it is used globally in almost every healthcare setting.[2] ECG is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that has a substantial clinical impact on investigating the severity of cardiovascular diseases.[3] ECG is increasingly being used for monitoring patients on antiarrhythmics and other drugs, as an integral part of preoperative assessment of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and for screening individuals in high-risk occupations and those participating in sports. Also, ECG serves as a research tool for surveillance and experimental trials of drugs with recognized cardiac effects.[4] Cardiovascular disease, as the
