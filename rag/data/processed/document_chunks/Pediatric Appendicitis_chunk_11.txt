suggestive of acute mesenteric adenitis. Acute bacterial ileitis may be due to infections with _Yersinia_ or _Campylobacter_ species.[47] Severe cervical motion tenderness during the bimanual pelvic examination may indicate pelvic inflammatory disease. One of the most challenging differential diagnoses of acute appendicitis is the acute presentation of Crohn disease. While a past medical history significant for Crohn disease can prevent unnecessary surgical procedures in the setting of acute abdominal pain, Crohn disease can initially present acutely, mimicking acute appendicitis. Intraoperatively, ileal inflammation should raise the suspicion of Crohn disease. ## Surgical Oncology The occurrence rate of appendiceal neoplasms in the United States is 1.2 cases per 100,000; nearly 30% of these patients present with acute abdominal pain. The most common appendiceal malignancies are gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors (GEP-NETs), goblet cell carcinoma (GCC), colonic-type adenocarcinoma, and mucinous neoplasm.[48] **Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP-NETs)** GEP-NETs are the most common histopathological subtype of appendiceal malignancies. They rarely metastasize; primary metastatic sites are the liver and lymph nodes. Therefore, in patients with suspicious GEP-NETs, further evaluation of the liver and the ileocolic lymph node basin are essential. Surgical management is dictated by the size of the primary tumor. An appendectomy with negative margins is the only surgical management in carcinoid tumors of \<1 cm in size. A right hemicolectomy is indicated for a carcinoid tumor of >2 cm. The optimum surgical intervention for carcinoid tumors measuring from 1 to 2 cm remains undefined. However, a right hemicolectomy is recommended for mesenteric invasion, enlarged lymph nodes, or equivocal surgical margins. **Goblet Cell Carcinoma** Goblet cell carcinomas are ubiquitous in appendiceal malignancies, sharing the diagnostic features of both appendiceal adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. A comprehensive peritoneal evaluation with further peritoneal cancer index score (PCIS) documentation should be undertaken. A right hemicolectomy will benefit patients with a non-metastatic lesion or a lesion â‰¥2 cm in size.[49] **Lymphoma** Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphoma, may initially present as acute appendicitis. The surgical management of this highly uncommon appendiceal malignancy should be limited to a simple appendectomy. However, a comprehensive systemic evaluation should be undertaken to exclude any potential metastatic site.[50] **Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma** Adenocarcinoma of the appendix, a rare appendiceal neoplasm with three histopathological subtypes, commonly presents as acute appendicitis. The standard treatment is a right hemicolectomy. The surgical management of appendiceal adenocarcinoma is irrespective of the tumor size or the involvement of the lymph node
