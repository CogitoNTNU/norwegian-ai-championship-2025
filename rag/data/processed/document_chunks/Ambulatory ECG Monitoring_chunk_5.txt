has many etiologies, including primary cardiac causes such as bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or inherited disorders such as Brugada or long-QT syndromes. Correlating symptoms with rhythm is the key to confirming cardiac electrical system involvement in syncope.[26] A 12-lead ECG may establish this link; ECG monitoring over an extended period is an essential evaluation component in cases of intermittent syncope. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope suggest ambulatory ECG monitoring in symptomatic patients with near syncope, unexplained syncope, or episodic dizziness with an unknown cause.[27] In a study of 85 patients with recurrent, undiagnosed syncope who underwent ILR placement to facilitate diagnosis, 42% of patients who recorded a rhythm during symptomatic syncopal episodes demonstrated an arrhythmia, usually some form of bradycardia.[28] Data indicates that external loop recorders (ELRs) may be comparably effective to ILRs. Locati et al demonstrated that ELRs offered a diagnostic yield similar to ILRs within the same timeframe in patients with syncope and presyncope.[29] Consideration of an ELR is a viable initial step for patients requiring extended ECG monitoring before resorting to implantable options. **Palpitations** The 2017 ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope also suggest ambulatory ECG monitoring in symptomatic patients with recurrent palpitations of an unknown cause. [27] Palpitations are one of the most prevalent reasons for ambulatory ECG monitoring. The underlying cause of palpitations can often be identified through an initial assessment and a 12-lead ECG; one-third of cases will have a psychiatric origin.[30] Ambulatory ECG monitoring is recommended when the cause of the palpitations remains unknown, even after obtaining a comprehensive medical history, performing a physical examination, and evaluating a resting 12-lead ECG.[31][32] Choosing an appropriate ECG monitoring device is predicated upon consideration of the clinical presentation and frequency of the palpitations. A traditional Holter monitor is indicated for patients experiencing daily symptoms. Loop recorders and patch monitors offer more diagnostic potential for those with infrequent palpitations, and opting for a 2-week monitoring period strikes a reasonable balance between diagnostic effectiveness and overall cost for most patients.[33][34] **Chest Pain and Ischemic Episodes** Ambulatory ECG monitoring is valuable for patients with atypical chest pain associated with stresses other than exercise by enabling the assessment of myocardial ischemia during routine activities. Ambulatory ECG monitoring sometimes unveils an underlying arrhythmia as the initiator of chest pain. In a study
