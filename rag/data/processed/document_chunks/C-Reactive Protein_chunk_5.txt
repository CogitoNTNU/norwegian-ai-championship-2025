as a nonspecific indicator of inflammation, and its levels are influenced by factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Therefore, CRP results should be interpreted within the broader clinical context and, when necessary, complemented with other diagnostic tests to enhance accuracy. ## Patient Safety and Education Patients should be informed about the significance of CRP testing, particularly its role in detecting inflammation and how the results contribute to their care plan. Clear communication helps set expectations and enhance understanding of the testâ€™s purpose. Patients should also be educated on factors that may influence CRP levels, such as medications, lifestyle habits, and chronic conditions like obesity or smoking. Providing adequate information about this test ensures accurate analysis of results and helps avoid misinterpretation caused by external factors. Educating patients fosters informed decision-making, improving their engagement in the diagnostic process and overall care. ## Clinical Significance CRP levels greater than 50 mg/dL are linked to bacterial infections in approximately 90% of cases. Multiple studies have explored CRP as a prognostic marker in both acute and chronic infections, including hepatitis C, dengue, and malaria.[25][26][27] Mild elevations, however, may lack clinical relevance. Careful clinical correlation remains essential when interpreting CRP results. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18744&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18744) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18744/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18744) [![C-Reactive Protein Isoforms and Their Phosphocholine Complexes](/books/NBK441843/bin/fimmu-15-1425168-g001.gif)](/books/NBK441843/figure/article-18744.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK441843/figure/article-18744.image.f1/?report=objectonly) C-Reactive Protein Isoforms and Their Phosphocholine Complexes.
