heart failure, ask if this is the same presentation as when they had previous episodes of heart failure or an acute decompensation. - **Symptom Causes:** Consider noncardiac and other causes of the patient's symptoms, as it is important to ensure a broad differential diagnosis and avoid anchoring bias, premature closer, and diagnostic inertia. - **Heart failure symptoms:** - Increasing dyspnea (on exertion, on lying flat or at rest, exercise intolerance) - Increasing leg swelling, ascites, edema - Increased body weight - Palpitations, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (associated with worse prognosis) - Chest pain, fatigue - Duration of Illness, recent or frequent hospitalizations for heart failure - Medications or diet changes - Anorexia, cachexia, or early satiety (associated with worse prognosis) - Symptoms of transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism (indicate a possible need for anticoagulation) - Social history and family history (to assess for possible familial cardiomyopathy, alcohol, or other cause - Travel history (exposure risk to some tropical diseases)\*\*\*\*[1][6] **Physical Examination** The physical examination should include the following: - **Vital signs:** Assess blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are important in helping develop and refine the differential diagnosis and help the healthcare professional tailor the physical examination better. - **Check patient weight:** The patient's weight and body mass index should be checked during each office visit. The information can be used to track response to treatment and the potential progression of heart failure or acute decompensated heart failure. Losing weight can also be a warning sign of worsening heart failure. - **Assessment of jugulovenous distension:** Jugulovenous distension can be a marker for fluid overload. The patient should lie at a 45-degree angle in bed to get an accurate assessment. - **Pulse:** Assess the regularity and strength of the pulse. - **Cardiac Examination** - Extra heart sounds (ie, S3 is associated with a worse prognosis), murmurs - Size and location of maximal cardiac impulse (can suggest ventricular enlargement if displaced) - Presence of right ventricular heave - **Pulmonary Examination:** Check respiratory rate, rhonchi, and rales (note: pleural effusions can mask and reduce breath sounds, and rhonchi or rales may be less prominent). - **Abdominal examination:** Check for ascites, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux. - **Lower extremity examination:** Assess for peripheral edema and skin temperature (cool lower extremities may suggest worse cardiac output).[1][6] ## Evaluation **Classification of Heart Failure** Classification is one of the key determinants of evaluating
