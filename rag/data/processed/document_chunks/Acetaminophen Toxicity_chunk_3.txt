\<50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. In addition, it is essential to adhere to a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen not exceeding 75 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 3750 mg. **Specific Patient Populations** **Hepatic impairment:** Acetaminophen is contraindicated in cases of active liver disease or severe hepatic impairment. Caution is advised for patients with mild hepatic impairment, necessitating a reduced total daily dosage of acetaminophen and regular monitoring of liver function. **Renal impairment:** In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min), extending dosing intervals and reducing the total daily dosage of acetaminophen may be advisable. **Pregnancy considerations:** Observational studies have associated prenatal acetaminophen exposure with potential reproductive and neurobehavioral effects, including the risks of cryptorchidism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder with prenatal APAP exposure.[12] However, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers acetaminophen safe for pregnant individuals. ACOG emphasizes that current evidence does not conclusively link acetaminophen use to fetal developmental issues. As neurodevelopmental disorders have multifactorial origins and brain development extends beyond birth, allowing for various potential influences, obstetricians must maintain current practices until further research provides more clarity. **Breastfeeding considerations:** Acetaminophen is suitable for pain relief and fever reduction in breastfeeding mothers. The levels detected in breast milk are significantly lower than typical infant doses, and there are infrequent reports of adverse effects in breastfed infants.[12] **Pediatric populations:** The recommended dosage for children aged 2 to 12 is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen is 75 mg/kg. - Neonates: The recommended dosage for premature children born at ≥32 weeks gestational age or less than 28 days old is 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, with a maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen set at 50 mg/kg. - Infants: Infants aged 29 days to 2 years are typically administered a dosage of 15 mg/kg every 6 hours, with a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen not exceeding 60 mg/kg. **Older patients:** As per the American Geriatric Society, the recommended acetaminophen dosage is 325 to 500 mg every 4 hours or 500 to 1000 mg every 6 hours, with a typical maximum daily dosage of 4
