This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, management, and prevention of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) and the role of the interprofessional team and athletic event staff in recognizing, managing, and educating athletes with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of EAH. - Outline the major risk factors and presenting signs/symptoms of EAH in athletes. - Review the complications of EAH in athletes. - Summarize the proper evaluation, prehospital and interprofessional team management, and prevention of EAH in athletes.

EAH is treated with fluid restriction or sodium replacement, depending upon severity. Avoiding overhydration can prevent EAH. Athletes, coaches, healthcare providers, and athletic event staff must be educated on EAH prevention strategies and presenting symptoms to decrease athletesâ€™ risk of development and progression to hyponatremic encephalopathy, coma, or death. ## Etiology EAH develops due to increased total body free water relative to total body sodium via two major mechanisms.[1] Firstly, before and during strenuous physical activity, athletes often increase their intake of hypotonic fluids such as water and sports drinks due to conditioned behaviors, leading to increased total body water. Secondly, physical exertion itself may result in inappropriate non-osmotic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, leading to free water retention.[1][4] ## Epidemiology EAH occurs in a wide variety of athletes in activities of various intensities, including ultramarathon and marathon running, triathlon, shorter distance running, military training operations,
