more adverse outcomes than simple febrile seizures.[1] The evaluation of febrile seizures primarily consists of characterizing a patient's type of febrile seizure and determining the fever's underlying cause through clinical assessment and diagnostic studies. Most febrile seizures spontaneously resolve and, therefore, may be expectantly managed. However, complex or longer-lasting febrile seizures may require pharmacologic therapy to stop the seizure activity.[4] This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence when managing febrile seizures, equipping them with updated knowledge, skills, and strategies for effective evaluation, timely treatment, and improved care coordination, leading to better patient outcomes. ## Etiology Febrile seizures are generalized seizures, typically in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, that occur with a fever greater than 100.4 °F (38 °C) not associated with a central nervous system (CNS) infection, a known seizure-provoking etiology (eg, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, or substance abuse), or history of an afebrile seizure.[1] No defined fever threshold is required to precipitate febrile seizures, as each patient's convulsive temperature threshold varies.[2][3] The primary febrile seizure risk factors appear to include existing neurologic impairment, the presence of a viral infection, a family history of seizure, developmental delay, decreased serum zinc and iron levels, and maternal smoking and stress.[1] An estimated 10% to 33% of patients have a first-degree relative with a positive seizure history, along with a concordance rate of approximately 35% to 69% in monozygotic twins and 14% to 20% in dizygotic twins, which suggests that the cause of febrile seizures may have a genetic component.[5][6] An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance and a polygenic or multifactorial mode of inheritance may be present in addition to specific genes that increase the risk of febrile seizures and are found on the following loci of chromosomes: 1q31, 2q23*34, 3p24.2*23, 3q26.2*26.33, 5q14*15, 5q34, 6q22*24, 8q13*21, 18p11*2, 19p13*3, 19q, and 21q22.[5] Another factor determining the risk of febrile seizures may be the highest temperature reached during a fever rather than the speed at which the temperature rises.[7][8][9] A contributing factor that can also affect fever's impact is the seizure threshold, which varies among individuals and changes with age and development. Infants have a higher risk of febrile seizures, but premature infants are at an even higher risk, especially those receiving postnatal corticosteroids.[10] Furthermore, infants generally have a lower seizure threshold, which may be modified by certain medications and water and electrolyte
