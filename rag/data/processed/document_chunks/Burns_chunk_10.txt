approximately 24 to 48 hours after the initial burn injury. Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade happens much faster than the sensitivity to succinylcholine (within the 24-48 hour window). Thus, the presenting burn patient may require higher than usual doses of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade than expected. An increased dose can partially overcome resistance to the neuromuscular blockade produced by rocuronium. Rocuronium can provide reasonably good intubating conditions with a 1.2 mg/kg dose after a significant burn injury.[15][16][17] ## Complications **Infection** Severe burns can weaken the immune system due to increased cytokine inflammatory markers, leading to a greater risk of infection. Wounds quickly become colonized with gram-positive organisms like _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Staphylococcus epidermis_. Over several days, intestinal microbes such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Escherichia coli_ colonize the wounds. Systemic antibiotic therapy is not necessarily warranted for these microbe colonizations perioperatively, although thorough wound cleansing with soap, water, normal saline, and/or chlorhexidine is advisable. Topical antibiotic therapy should be suitable for the perioperative period in the early phases of a burn. A conversation between the surgeon and anesthesiologist can minimize the overuse of antibiotics in this subset of patients.[18][19][20] ## Clinical Significance Anesthesia for patients with burns is a challenging subspecialty that requires a cautious approach and an understanding of the pathophysiology of burns to optimize clinical outcomes. Understanding the airway difficulties one could encounter when managing severe head and neck burns is essential to prevent the dreaded "can't ventilate, can't intubate" scenario. The most conservative approach involves just enough anesthetic to make the patient comfortable while maintaining spontaneous ventilation and performing fiberoptic intubation. Understanding the pathophysiology of burns is essential to anticipate hemodynamic changes in burn patients and how to adequately fluid resuscitate the patient intraoperatively before transferring to an intensive care setting. Intraoperative intervention related to the thermoregulatory changes in burn patients undergoing anesthesia can help to prevent wound infection, impaired coagulation, and perioperative shivering. Anesthesiologists play a critical role in the perioperative care of burn patients, and a better understanding of the hazards in treating patients with burns patients can reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Approximately 500,000 people present to the emergency department each year with a burn, but most of these patients do not require critical care.[1] When critical care is required, minutes count as a difficult airway can quickly advance to a "can't ventilate, can't intubate" situation with the swelling that
