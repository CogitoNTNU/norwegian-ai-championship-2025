rupture rates around 15% in Western countries, a figure that may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] Cervical ectopic pregnancy has an incidence of \<1% and has been reported to occur following dilation and curettage in 70% of these patients. Ectopic pregnancies within the ovary occur in \<3% of cases, while abdominal implantation occurs in 0.9% to 1.4% of cases.[4] Abdominal pregnancies have a higher mortality than other types of ectopic pregnancy at 10%; however, due to a higher frequency of delayed diagnosis and up to 7 times higher risk of organ perforation and massive hemorrhage.[4] Interstitial ectopic pregnancies are reported in up to 4% of all ectopic implantation sites. Reports also exist of implantation sites in omental, retroperitoneal, splenic, and hepatic locations.[4][8] Additionally, the growing rate of cesarean deliveries, currently 21% of births worldwide, may contribute to an increase in cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies, which has an incidence of approximately \<1%.[5][4] The incidence of heterotopic pregnancies, where both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies occur simultaneously, has risen due to assisted reproductive technologies, with in vitro fertilization increasing the likelihood of ectopic implantation.[8] The risk of developing a heterotopic pregnancy has been estimated as high as 1:100 in women seeking in vitro fertilization.[8] Ectopic pregnancies occur in 2.1% to 8.6% of in vitro fertilization conceptions, compared to around 2% in natural pregnancies.[4] ## Pathophysiology Smooth muscle contraction and ciliary beat within the fallopian tubes assist with the transport of an oocyte or embryo to the uterine cavity. For a tubal ectopic pregnancy, damage to the fallopian tubes, usually secondary to inflammation, induces tubal dysfunction, which can result in the retention of an oocyte or embryo within the tube. Several local factors can induce inflammation, including toxic, infectious, immunologic, and hormonal etiologies.[8] An upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines occurs following tubal damage; this subsequently promotes embryo implantation, invasion, and angiogenesis within the fallopian tube.[8] Chlamydia trachomatis infection results in the production of interleukin 1 by tubal epithelial cells; this is a vital indicator for embryo implantation within the endometrium.[8] Interleukin 1 also has a role in downstream neutrophil recruitment, which would further contribute to fallopian tubal damage.[8] Cilia beat frequency is also negatively affected by smoking and infection. Hormonal variations throughout the menstrual cycle additionally have demonstrated effects on cilia beat frequency.[8] ## Histopathology The most common site for ectopic pregnancy adherence is in the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.[8] Reportedly, 95%
