surgery with general anesthetics, 2. hospitalization, 3. Cesarean section, 4. hormone replacement therapy, 5. pregnancy and peripartum period, 6. lower extremity injury with limited mobility for more than 72 hours.[4] It should be noted that general anesthesia for longer than 30 minutes and hospitalization for longer than 72 hours are considered the transient risk factors of DVT.[4] However, active cancers and specific medical conditions that increase the risk of venous thromboembolism are categorized as persistent risk factors. Systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel disease are among the predisposing medical conditions.[4] Any further etiological risk factors not categorized among either transient or persistent subgroups should be labeled as unprovoked VTE.[4][1] For instance, a recent cohort study, including 500 participants evaluating the association of blood lipid levels and lower extremity DVT (LEDVT), demonstrated that higher total cholesterol levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) were associated with a decreased risk of lower extremity DVT (LEDVT). However, higher triglyceride levels (TG) were associated with a greater risk of LEDVT.[1] ## Epidemiology Incidence and prevalence: Deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli are common and often "silent" and thus go undiagnosed or are only picked up at autopsy. Therefore, the incidence and prevalence are often underestimated. It is thought the annual incidence of DVT is 80 cases per 100,000, with a prevalence of lower limb DVT of 1 case per 1000 population.[1] Annually in the United States, more than 200,000 people develop venous thrombosis; of those, 50,000 cases are complicated by pulmonary embolism.[22][23][24] - Age: Deep-vein thrombosis is rare in children, and the risk increases with age, most occurring in the over-40 age group.[1] - Gender: There is no consensus about whether there is a sex bias in the incidence of DVT. - Ethnicity\*\*:\*\* There is evidence from the United States that there is an increased incidence of DVT and an increased risk of complications in African Americans and white people compared to Hispanic and Asian populations. - Associated diseases: In the hospital, the most commonly associated conditions are malignancy, congestive heart failure, obstructive airway disease, and patients undergoing surgery. ## Pathophysiology According to the Virchow triad, the following are the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in DVT: - Damage to the vessel wall - Blood flow turbulence - Hypercoagulability Thrombosis is a protective mechanism that prevents the loss of blood and seals off damaged blood vessels. Fibrinolysis counteracts or stabilizes thrombosis. The triggers of venous
