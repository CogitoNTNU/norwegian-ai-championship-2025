bilious vomiting, peritonitis, hematochezia, abdominal distension, and hemodynamic instability. A cecal or sigmoid volvulus in adults generally presents with a gradual onset of abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, and constipation or constipation but can present with severe acute abdominal pain. Vomiting typically begins a few days after the pain starts. The pain linked to a cecal or sigmoid volvulus is generally persistent and intense, with intermittent colicky episodes occurring during peristalsis.[29] Intussusception:\*\*\*\* An infant or toddler with an intussusception classically presents with sudden, severe, and progressively worsening abdominal pain. The pain presents as intermittent episodes of inconsolable crying and pulling the legs up toward the abdomen. The episodes generally occur every 15 to 20 min and increase in frequency and intensity. Vomiting is also a common symptom. Initially, the vomit may be nonbilious but often turns bilious as the condition advances. Occasionally, the clinician may palpate a sausage-shaped mass in the right abdomen. Approximately 25% of affected children have bloody stools, but stool guiac is often positive. Rarely do the stools appear like the classic currant jelly often described, as this is a late finding due to significant bleeding and sloughing of the mucosa. Mesenteric ischemia:\*\*\*\* Mesenteric ischemia presents as acute, severe, and diffuse abdominal pain. The pain is often disproportionate to what the clinician finds on examination. Acute colonic ischemia is generally on the left side and associated with hematochezia and tenesmus. At the same time, an arterial embolism to the proximal superior mesenteric artery presents with pain in the periumbilical area. Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "[Acute Mesenteric Ischemia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25017)," for more information. Necrotizing enterocolitis: The most common sign of necrotizing enterocolitis is a sudden change in feeding tolerance.[[39]](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173117#ref_32855506) Additional findings may include abdominal wall erythema, crepitus, and induration. Infants may also experience apnea, temperature instability, and lethargy. Hypotension and septic shock occur in severe cases. Ovarian torsion:\*\*\*\* Ovarian torsion manifests as severe pelvic pain, nausea, and vomiting in a patient with an adnexal mass. Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract:\*\*\*\* Patients with perforation may present with chest, neck, or abdominal pain. The sudden onset of worsening pain after medical instrumentation should alert the clinician to the possibility of perforation. Associated symptoms depend on the organ affected and the contents released. Patients can develop peritonitis, a fistula, or an abscess if the fluid remains contained. Splenic rupture:\*\*\*\* Splenic rupture is typically due to trauma. Patients may complain of left upper abdominal,
