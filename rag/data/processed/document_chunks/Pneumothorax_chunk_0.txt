The clinical presentation of the condition varies widely, from mild or asymptomatic cases to life-threatening respiratory failure. Pneumothorax is classified into 3 main categories—spontaneous, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax can occur without an external cause and is further divided into primary and secondary. Traumatic pneumothorax results from blunt or penetrating chest injuries, including medical procedures such as lung biopsy or central venous catheter placement. The most critical form, tension pneumothorax, is a rapidly progressive emergency where trapped air causes mediastinal shift and hemodynamic instability, requiring immediate needle decompression. This activity reviews an in-depth review of the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of acute pneumothorax. The activity covers modern diagnostic tools, including radiology advancements, and outlines conservative and interventional treatment options. In addition, it emphasizes the vital role of the interprofessional healthcare team, including emergency physicians, thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists, in ensuring timely recognition and optimal patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Identify the clinical signs and symptoms of pneumothorax. - Assess imaging studies, such as chest x-rays and ultrasound, for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of pneumothorax progression. - Apply evidence-based guidelines to determine when conservative management or surgical intervention is necessary. - Collaborate with emergency physicians, thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists to optimize patient outcomes.

This accumulation can disrupt normal lung expansion, impairing ventilation and oxygenation. The clinical presentations of pneumothorax range from asymptomatic to a life-threatening emergency, depending on factors such as the volume of air, the rate of accumulation, and the patient's underlying respiratory status.[1][2] Pneumothorax is categorized into 3 broad types based on its etiology and pathophysiology—spontaneous, traumatic, and tension. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without an apparent external cause and is further divided into primary and secondary types. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax develops in individuals without underlying lung disease, most commonly
