encompasses both community-acquired and healthcare-associated forms, constituting a physiopathological occurrence that lacks a precise definition. According to a recent review following clinical practice guidelines from Japan, aspiration pneumonia diagnosis hinges on the presence of lung inflammation in patients exhibiting evident aspiration, with documented dysphagia, or a clinical condition strongly associated with aspiration or dysphagia.[2] An infectious process, aspiration pneumonia entails the proliferation and invasion of pathogenic bacteria from the inhaled fluid into the pulmonary parenchyma.[3] Aspiration pneumonitis differs from aspiration pneumonia in clinical presentation. While both occur following an aspiration event, aspiration pneumonitis manifests as a noninfectious chemical lung injury from inhaling sterile fluid or gastric contents.[3] Clinicians and healthcare institutions must maintain a high suspicion of aspiration pneumonia in patients susceptible to this condition to ensure accurate diagnosis and mitigate complications. However, the existing literature lacks comprehensive guidance in this regard. Moreover, definitively diagnosing aspiration pneumonia, particularly in cases involving multiple microaspirations, poses a significant challenge. Empiric therapy for patients with aspiration pneumonia has also changed, underscoring the necessity for educating clinical providers on typical presentations, diagnostic protocols, and treatment options for aspiration pneumonia. ## Etiology Natural physiologic defense mechanisms such as the glottis closure and the cough reflex usually prevent aspiration pneumonia. Nevertheless, their failure increases the risk of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia. Various factors contribute to this risk, including altered mental status, neurological disorders, esophageal motility issues, persistent vomiting, and gastric outlet obstruction. Conditions that increase the risk of aspiration in adults include the following:[1][2][3] - Advanced age - Cerebrovascular disease, known as post-stroke pneumonia - Drug overdose - Alcohol use disorder - Seizures - Sedative medication use - Central nervous system disorders - Head trauma - Intracranial masses - Dementia - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Parkinson disease - Pseudobulbar palsy - Poor mobility and debility (eg, bedridden status) - Esophageal strictures, motility disorders, and cancers - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Tracheostomy - Nasogastric tube placement - Muscular diseases - Inflammatory myopathies - Bulbospinal muscular atrophy - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy Advanced age correlates strongly with aspiration pneumonia, as many older adults experience silent microaspirations that may not be clinically apparent.[1] Among patients aged 70 or older hospitalized with pneumonia, dysphagia prevalence was reported at 91.7%, with silent aspirations occurring in over 50% of cases. However, advanced age does not directly predict the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Frailty, poor nutritional status, and limited mobility are
