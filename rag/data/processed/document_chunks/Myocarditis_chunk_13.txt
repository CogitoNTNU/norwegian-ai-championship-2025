risk of sudden cardiac death. - Myocardial fibrosis and scarring. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Preventing acute myocarditis begins with addressing avoidable causes, particularly infectious triggers such as respiratory and enteroviral illnesses. Patients should be educated on essential hygiene practices—such as regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick, and staying up-to-date with routine vaccinations, including those for influenza and COVID-19—to help reduce the risk of viral myocarditis.[27] Patients should be informed about the variable and often nonspecific nature of myocarditis symptoms. Any febrile or systemic illness followed by new-onset symptoms—such as exertional or positional shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, or syncope—warrants prompt medical evaluation. Strenuous physical activity should be avoided during and immediately after a viral illness, as it may increase the risk of cardiac complications. Notably, the diagnosis of myocarditis is frequently delayed due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the need to rule out other conditions using imaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessment.[5] Once the diagnosis is confirmed, comprehensive patient education is essential to improving outcomes. Patients should be informed about the possible trajectories of the disease, including full recovery, delayed improvement, or progression to chronic heart dysfunction that may require lifelong medication. Education should emphasize the importance of adhering to strict physical activity restrictions during the acute phase, abstaining from alcohol, following prescribed medical treatments, and participating in cardiac rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and restore functional capacity.[27][28] Long-term management may include GDMT for heart failure in patients with persistent cardiac dysfunction. A multidisciplinary healthcare team, comprising cardiologists, heart failure specialists, cardiac imaging experts, interventional cardiologists, pharmacists, nurses, and rehabilitation professionals, is essential for delivering coordinated, patient-centered care. Additionally, patients should be educated on the importance of social and economic support systems in their recovery. Social determinants of health—including access to healthcare, insurance coverage, food and housing security, and availability of community resources—are critical factors influencing outcomes after acute myocarditis.[5] A strong support system, active patient engagement, and adherence to lifestyle modifications—such as a balanced diet, weight management, and tobacco cessation—are vital for achieving sustained recovery and minimizing the risk of recurrence or long-term complications. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of acute myocarditis requires a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach due to the condition’s variable progression and potential for rapid clinical deterioration. Most patients require hospitalization given the risk of life-threatening complications, including decompensated heart failure, malignant arrhythmias, and multiple-organ failure.
