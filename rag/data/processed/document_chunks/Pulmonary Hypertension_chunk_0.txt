We describe a phenomenon known as high altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH), which is classically defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg on a right heart catheterization and results in pulmonary vascular remodeling. This condition can present in individuals who typically reside at altitudes greater than 2500 meters. The hypoxic stimulus of high altitude and individual genetic factors play a role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary vasoconstriction and, eventually, vascular remodeling that occurs with HAPH. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment of HAPH and highlights the interprofessional team's role in providing well-coordinated care to enhance patient outcomes. **Objectives:** - Assess the etiology of high altitude pulmonary hypertension. - Evaluate the clinical evaluation of high-altitude pulmonary hypertension. - Identify the management options available for high-altitude pulmonary hypertension. - Communicate the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and understanding of high altitude pulmonary hypertension to improve clinical outcomes.

More than 40 million people visit high altitude areas (greater than 2500 meters) every year, and a reported 140 million have a permanent residence at these elevations.[1] The decreased barometric and partial pressures of oxygen at high altitudes can reduce inspired oxygen levels compared to sea levels. The body's exaggerated physiological response to rapid ascent, a lower level of inspired oxygen, or the persistent hypoxic stimulus experienced at high altitude can cause significant morbidity and mortality. High altitude-associated disease processes can vary from mild to life-threatening. The body's response can present in acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and, ultimately, high-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH). Acute mountain sickness develops secondary to rapid ascent and can be described as a "hangover, " including nonspecific symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia.[2] High altitude pulmonary edema is a progression of acute mountain sickness and presents with acute pulmonary, a complication of the
