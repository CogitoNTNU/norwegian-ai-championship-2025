repair device. Procedural rooms are specialized with fluoroscopic capability. The procedure involves using fluoroscopic and TEE guidance to image the heart before, during, and after the procedure.[59] The patient will be under general anesthesia for ease and comfort and to avoid patient movement during the procedure. The following table demonstrates the procedure's major steps; the TEE views to guide those steps, and potential complications with each step (see **Table 7.** Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair Procedure Overview). **Table 7.** Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair\*\*\*\* Procedure Overview [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table6/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK536988/table/article-179.table6/?report=objectonly) Preprocedure: Cardiac assessment and evaluation of MV by TEE [60] The valvular pathology must be confirmed IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; RA, right atrium; IAS, interatrial septum; SVC, superior vena cava; ACT, activated clotting time; SGC, steerable guide catheter; ASD, atrial septal defect; PACU, post-anesthesia care unit; ICU, intensive care unit; MV, mitral valve; IAS, iatrogenic atrial septa; TEER, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair; MR, mitral regurgitation; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography ## Complications Despite the significant comorbidities among the patients being treated, TEER is a safe operation with a low likelihood of major consequences. The table below summarizes the most common complications and their relative occurrence rates (see **Table 8.** TEER Complications).

The heightened leaflet perforation, tear, or single leaflet device attachment risk in patients with long-standing secondary MR and calcified leaflets raises significant concerns. The percutaneous retrieval of embolized devices can pose challenges, particularly when larger clips are involved.[70] While afterload mismatch may occur in individuals with reduced left ventricle function, it is an infrequent and transient event typically managed with inotropic medications, often not necessitating mechanical support. Despite its rarity, afterload mismatch may adversely impact long-term outcomes, possibly indicating an advanced stage of heart failure. In some cases of secondary MR with severely impaired left ventricle function, thrombus development in the left atrium or ventricle may occur. Early and intensive anticoagulant therapy may be deemed necessary for these patients.[71] The multidisciplinary team must reassess the indication for mitral valve surgery or reintervention when confronted with residual or recurrent MR. A repeat transesophageal echocardiography is typically warranted to comprehend the underlying disease, identify residual leaflet anatomy for potential device implantation, and assess the risk of significant mitral stenosis. In case series with limited safety data, alternative interventional strategies for managing substantial para-clip or inter-clip residual MR have been explored.
