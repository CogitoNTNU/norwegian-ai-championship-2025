tachycardias with QRS width being less than 3 mm or 120 milliseconds on the EKG strip. Supraventricular tachycardia is further classified into atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia based on the mechanism of tachycardia. \*\*\*\* I. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT): As found in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (the presence of delta wave without arrhythmia doesn’t require investigation or treatment). Mechanism: Accessory pathway present outside of the AV node-Bundle of Kent. It can be further categorized into: - Antidromic: Conduction down the accessory pathway and up to the AV node leading to the formation of a delta wave. - Orthodromic _:_ Conduction down the AV node into an accessory pathway with no delta wave. Signs & Symptoms: Palpitation, shortness of breath, or syncope. EKG Findings: Slurred upstroke of the QRS, delta wave, may give an impression of the wide QRS complex. Management: Amiodarone or procainamide. If this fails, the next step is synchronized cardioversion. Definitive Therapy: Ablation of the accessory pathway. II. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) Mechanism: Slow & fast fibers present in AV node & peri-nodal tissue leading to re-entry. Signs & Symptoms: Sudden tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or syncope. EKG Findings: Narrow complex tachycardia with P waves hidden in T waves. Heart rate is in the range of 150-160 bpm. Management: Step 1: Carotid massage/Valsalva maneuver Step 2: Adenosine Step 3: Cardioversion Step 4: Ablation or chronic suppressive therapy with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem/verapamil. III.\*\*\*\* Atrial fibrillation: It is the most common arrhythmia in the United States. It affects more than 20% of the general population at some time in their lives.[4] There are five types based on their duration:[5] - New-onset - Paroxysmal: Self-terminating or intermittent - Persistent: Fails to self-terminate within 7 days and requires treatments (medical or electrical cardioversion) - Long-standing Persistent: Lasts for ≥ 1 year - Permanent: Persistent for ≥ 1 year despite treatment Mechanism: Multiple reentrant wavelets due to atrial ectopy from muscle fibers near the proximal part of the pulmonary vein. Signs & Symptoms: It can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms like palpitation, shortness of breath, irregularly irregular pulse, or even hypotension. EKG Findings: Irregularly irregular narrow complex tachycardia with no discernable P-waves. Management: The management strategy for atrial fibrillation can be classified into rate control or rhythm control. The decision to use a rate control or a rhythm-control strategy depends
