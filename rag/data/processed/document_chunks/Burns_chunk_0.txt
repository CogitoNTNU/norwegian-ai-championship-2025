The patient with severe burns poses added challenges of airway management, fluid resuscitation, and vascular access due to direct trauma to the skin and soft tissue structures. This activity reviews and highlights the critical components necessary for the anesthetic management of a patient with severe burns, emphasizing the inter-professional team in evaluation and treatment. **Objectives:** - Explain how the pathophysiologic changes associated with burns alter anesthetic management. - Identify the ideal approach to an airway complicated by significant thermal injury to supraglottic structures. - Utilize the Parkland formula for fluid resuscitation after a severe burn and the parameters by which fluid resuscitation should be guided. - Collaborate with the interprofessional team to optimize the care of a patient with burns and provide anesthesia management.

The anesthesiologist plays a critical role in managing complicated cases involving airway management, hemodynamic support, intravascular access, thermoregulation, and pulmonary support. The airway of a severely burned patient can quickly become compromised with traditional means of anesthesia and requires special attention to ensure adequate ventilation. When treating patients with burns, the complex pathophysiologic changes pose challenges in performing intraoperative fluid resuscitation, selecting appropriate induction drugs, and determining optimal ventilation strategies. The anesthesiologist plays a critical role in optimizing the care of these patients.[1][2] ## Anatomy and Physiology Major burns damage tissues directly and distort the anatomy making traditional airway management, monitoring, and hemodynamic access challenging. Developing a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response also results in pathophysiologic effects both locally and distantly from the injury. This response can be described in 2 distinct phases: burn shock (ebb) followed by a hypermetabolic (flow) phase. The inflammatory response begins minutes after tissue destruction resulting in sensitization and irritation of the pain fibers.[1][3] The burn shock or ebb phase occurs during the first
