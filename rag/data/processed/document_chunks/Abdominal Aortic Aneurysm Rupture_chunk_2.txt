prevalence of 4.3% in men and 2.1% in women as detected by ultrasound.[5] ## Pathophysiology AAAs tend to occur when there is a failure of the structural proteins of the aorta. What causes these proteins to fail is unknown, but the aortic wall gradually weakens. The decrease in structural proteins of the aortic wall, such as elastin and collagen, has been identified.[6][7][8] The aortic wall is made of collagen lamellar units. The number of lamellar units is lower in the infrarenal aorta than in the thoracic aorta.[8][9][10] This is believed to contribute to the increased incidence of aneurysmal formation in the infrarenal aorta. A chronic inflammatory process has been identified in the wall of the aorta, but its cause remains unclear.[11] Other factors that may play a role in developing these aneurysms include genetics, marked inflammation, and proteolytic degradation of the connective tissue in the aortic wall.[12][13][14] See **Image.** Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration. ## Histopathology Autopsy studies of AAAs usually show significant degeneration of the media and typically reveal a state of chronic inflammation with an infiltrate of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. The media is often thin, and there is evidence of degeneration of the connective tissue. ## History and Physical Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are incidentally identified during examinations for other unrelated pathologies, and most individuals are asymptomatic. Palpation of the abdomen usually reveals a nontender, pulsatile abdominal mass. Enlarging aneurysms can cause symptoms such as abdominal, flank, or back pain; the compression of adjacent viscera can cause gastrointestinal or renal manifestations. AAAs are life-threatening. However, the presentation of patients with this type of ruptured aneurysm can vary from subtle to dramatic. Most patients may present in shock, often exhibiting diffuse abdominal pain and distension. Patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm often succumb even before reaching the hospital. The patient may have tenderness over the aneurysm or demonstrate signs of embolization. If the aneurysm ruptures into adjacent viscera or vessels, presenting findings may include gastrointestinal bleeding or congestive heart failure due to the aortocaval fistula. A physical examination should also include an assessment for other associated aneurysms, the most common being an iliac artery aneurysm. Peripheral aneurysms are also associated with approximately 5% of patients, with popliteal artery aneurysms being the most common. ## Evaluation The diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually made using ultrasound (see **Images.** Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Ultrasound and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration).
