of the myocardium (see **Image.** Specimen Showing MI). The subsequent inability to produce ATP in the mitochondria triggers an ischemic cascade, ultimately leading to apoptosis (cell death) of the endocardium or myocardial infarction. With some exceptions due to genetic variation, coronary arteries exhibit unique and diagnostic territorial distributions. For example, the left anterior descending coronary artery supplies blood flow to the interventricular septum, anterolateral wall, and ventricular apex. The left circumflex artery supplies blood to the inferolateral wall. The right coronary artery supplies the right ventricle. The inferior wall is supplied either by the left circumflex or right coronary artery.[8] ## Histopathology The histological changes observed in MI evolve throughout the disease course. At time 0, no microscopic histologic changes are observed. Within 0.5 to 4 hours, light microscopy reveals the waviness of fibers at the tissue periphery along with glycogen depletion. At 4 to 12 hours, the myocardium undergoes coagulation necrosis and edema. At 12 to 24 hours, the gross specimen appears dark and mottled, with contraction band necrosis and neutrophil predominance observed on histopathology. Subsequently, nuclei reduction occurs between 1 to 3 days, and then, within the next 3 to 7 days, macrophages emerge to clear apoptotic cells. Granulation tissue appears at 7 to 10 days, and collagen type I deposition occurs after 10 days. Ultimately, after 2 months, the myocardium undergoes scarring. ## History and Physical The history and physical examination alone may not always diagnose AMI definitively. The history should focus on the onset, quality, and associated symptoms. Recent studies suggest that diaphoresis and bilateral arm radiating pain are more commonly associated with MI in men. Other associated symptoms may include the following: - Lightheadedness - Anxiety - Cough - Choking sensation - Diaphoresis - Wheezing - Irregular heart rate The physical examination should include the patientâ€™s vital signs and appearance, including diaphoresis, pulmonary evaluation, and cardiac auscultation. Specific vital aspects of the examination are as follows: - **Heart rate:** Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular arrhythmia may be present, indicating cardiac electrical disturbances. - **Pulses:** Unequal pulses may be observed if the patient has an aortic dissection, indicating a potential arterial problem. - **Blood pressure:** Blood pressure is typically high in AMI but may become hypotensive if the patient is in shock due to compromised cardiac function. - **Respiratory findings:** Tachypnea and fever may be present, indicating an inflammatory response. - **Neck veins:** Distended neck veins
