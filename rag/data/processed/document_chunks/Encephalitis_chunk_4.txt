in handling livestock. The disease manifested as headache, vomiting, blurry vision, and loss of consciousness following a sinus infection. Histopathology of a single 2 cm focal lesion in the posterior left temporal lobe demonstrated trophozoites (40 to 60 microns in diameter) with two nuclei. The infection was likely acquired by inhalation. He was treated with a combination of flucytosine (2.75 g, 4 times a day for 25 weeks), itraconazole (200 mg/day), intravenous pentamidine isethionate (300 mg/day for 6 weeks), and azithromycin (250 mg/day for 31 weeks). The treatment resulted in complete recovery. ## Differential Diagnosis The clinical presentation of PAM is very similar to acute bacterial meningitis, and CSF parameters are also alike. Therefore, obtaining an epidemiological history in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis but negative cultures and failure to improve cannot be emphasized enough.[8] The differential diagnosis of GAE includes bacterial brain abscesses, tuberculosis, Nocardia, CNS aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and _Histoplasma_. Toxoplasmosis and cysticercosis, as well as CNS lymphoma, should be considered.[8] ## Treatment Planning [![Table Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/table-icon.gif)](/books/NBK430754/table/article-17437.table0/?report=objectonly "Table") #### [Table](/books/NBK430754/table/article-17437.table0/?report=objectonly) Table 1. Drugs for primary amebic meningoencephalitis. ## Prognosis PAM is associated with an extremely high mortality rate. Studies have reported a case-fatality rate of as high as 99%. The mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 5.3 days (ranging from 1 to 12 days), and the mean time from exposure to death was 9.9 days (ranging from 6 to 17 days). ## Complications Complications of PAM can include the following: - Hallucinations - Seizures - Comma - Death ## Consultations The patient is managed by emergency physicians, internists, and infectious disease consultants. ## Deterrence and Patient Education Measures to prevent primary amebic meningoencephalitis due to _Naegleria_ include the following: - Avoid diving and jumping into stagnant freshwater. - Consider using nose plugs for unavoidable exposures or pinching your nose shut when diving or swimming in freshwater. - Keep your head above water when swimming in freshwater, hot springs, and other untreated thermal bodies of water. - When participating in water-related activities, avoid digging, or stirring up the sediment. - Use boiled, filtered, or sterile water for nasal or sinus irrigation, not tap water. Measures to prevent GAE and keratitis due to _Acanthamoeba_ include: - Replace contacts as prescribed. - Remove lenses before activity involving contact with water. - Wash hands with soap before handling contact lenses and clean lenses as instructed by the manufacturer. ## Pearls and
