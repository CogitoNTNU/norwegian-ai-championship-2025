of prostacyclin/PGD2, promotes vasodilatory effects on the coronary artery vasculature.[12] This vasodilatory effect induces coronary steal in a pharmacologic stress test to induce myocardial ischemia in vessels affected by coronary artery disease. ## Administration Dipyridamole is available in tablet forms of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg strengths. The generic version is also available. In addition to its tablet formulation, there is also an intravenous solution of the strength of 5 mg/mL. The intravenous solution is applicable for its adjunctive use during pharmacologic stress testing, typically administered over four minutes. **Indication Specific Dosing** Thromboembolism prophylaxis in post-cardiac valve replacement: 75 to 100 mg PO 4 times daily as an adjunct to warfarin. Myocardial perfusion scan: injectable solution of 5mg/mL is administered at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min IV infusion over 4 minutes. The maximal allowed dose for this use is 70 mg. **Dosing Adjustments** The dosing recommendations for patients with significant obesity have not undergone thorough evaluation, although a general guideline of a maximum dose of 70 mg has been recommended. There is no need to dose adjust this medication for those patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in geriatric patients using this medication as its oral formulation is a Beers List medication, although the extended-release form combined with aspirin is not on the Beers List.[15] **Pediatric Dosing** Pediatric use of this medication has limited data, but guidelines suggest 2.0 to 6.0mg/kg/daily for its antiplatelet effect. Given the limited data, dipyridamole is not a first-line agent for the use of antiplatelet therapy for pediatric and adolescent patients. ## Adverse Effects **Most Commonly Reported Adverse Effects** [16] 1.
