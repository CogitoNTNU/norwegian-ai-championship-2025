conditions, vital sign abnormalities, and a toxic appearance. As with all clinical diseases, not every case follows the expected course. Close follow-up and adherence with management strategies are necessary to monitor for disease progression. A smaller proportion of patients may require hospitalization due to disease progression, as indicated by the pneumonia severity index, SMART-COP, and CURB-65 scores. Several risk factors are associated with poorer outcomes, including an increased risk of early mortality.[82] These factors include increased age, hypothermia, altered mental status, multilobar pneumonia, shock at presentation, preexisting congestive cardiac failure, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal impairment, and malnutrition.[83][84][85][86] Death from atypical bacterial pneumonia is rare but can occur in patients with comorbidities and older individuals, with mortality rates reaching up to 11% among those admitted to intensive care.[51] ## Complications Similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, the most prominent complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, multiorgan failure, coagulopathy, and exacerbation of preexisting comorbidities.[87] Other potential complications of bacterial pneumonia include: - Lung fibrosis [88] - Destruction of lung parenchyma - Necrotizing pneumonia [89] - Cavitation - Empyema [90] - Pulmonary abscess - Death Given the known extrapulmonary manifestations of atypical bacterial pneumonia, particularly for _M. pneumonia_ e, autoimmune conditions can occur. Guillain–Barré syndrome, including its Miller Fisher syndrome variant; erythema multiforme; erythema nodosum; hemolytic anemia (cold agglutinin disease); autoimmune encephalitis; and transverse myelitis have all been noted to occur with or following _M. pneumoniae_ infection, though they occur in only approximately 0.1% of cases.[91][92][93][94] According to case reports, _L._ _pneumophila_ can rarely be associated with panniculitis, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis.[95][96] Similarly, according to the limited literature available, _C._ _pneumoniae_ can rarely be associated with endocarditis and pleuro-pericarditis.[97] Epidemiological studies suggest an association between _C. pneumoniae_ infection and an increased risk of lung cancer, warranting further investigation.[98][99] ## Deterrence and Patient Education As with the deterrence and education required for patients with bacterial pneumonia, atypical bacterial pneumonia should be similarly managed. Smoking cessation, maintenance of oral and hand hygiene, and limitation of hazardous alcohol intake should be emphasized given their associations with pneumonia.[100][101][102][103] The older individuals should be encouraged to obtain influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations to limit the risk of secondary or co-infections when unwell with atypical bacterial pneumonia.[104][105] ## Pearls and Other Issues Key considerations in the management and monitoring of atypical bacterial pneumonia include: - Most patients respond with clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours. - The
