Geriatric patients account for a quarter of trauma admissions nationally. Cervical spine injuries are relatively common in the elderly population. These injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This activity examines when this condition should be considered in differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate these conditions. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and caring for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Review the various type of cervical spine injuries, most notably fractures, in light of pre-disposing factors and pathologies prevalent in geriatric patients. - Outline the diagnostic approach and evaluation criteria for potential cervical spine injuries in the geriatric population. - Summarize the treatment options for cervical spine fractures and other injuries in the elderly. - Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of cervical spine injuries in the elderly and improve outcomes.

Geriatric patients account for a quarter of trauma admissions nationally. Cervical spine injuries are relatively common in the elderly population.[1] These injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.[2] The percentage of elderly patients with trauma has been on the rise and will continue to increase into the ensuing decades.[2][3][4][5] Clinicians are cautioned to maintain a heightened index of clinical suspicion to rule out cervical pathology even in the setting of low-energy mechanisms of injury, for example, ground level falls. Often geriatric traumas present with confounding variables such as baseline dementia, auditory and visual impairment, and inherent difficulty when cooperating with the acute physical examination.[6][7] ## Etiology Most geriatric cervical spine injuries are secondary to falls (greater than 60%). They can, however, occur secondary to any traumatic mechanism (for example, motor vehicle accidents, assault,
