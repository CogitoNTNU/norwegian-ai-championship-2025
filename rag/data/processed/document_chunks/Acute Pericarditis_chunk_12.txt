surgeon, infectious disease specialist, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner. Most patients present with vague chest pain, which can be mistaken for a heart attack, pleurisy, or angina. Therefore, consulting with a cardiologist before initiating treatment is essential. In most cases, conservative treatment with NSAIDs effectively resolves pericarditis; however, an echocardiogram is typically performed to rule out pericardial fluid and/or tamponade. If drainage of the pericardial fluid is necessary, the patient should be kept NPO and educated about the available treatment options. Patients with uremic pericarditis require close follow-up, as recurrence of pericardial fluid and signs of pericarditis are common. Additionally, patients should be advised to limit strenuous activity, as this may increase the risk of hypotension and arrhythmias. Pharmacists should educate patients about medication compliance. If colchicine is used as a preventive measure, the patient should be informed about potential adverse effects and the importance of follow-up appointments. A cardiology nurse should monitor these patients until all symptoms have resolved. Throughout the process, interprofessional healthcare team members should maintain open communication to ensure improved patient outcomes. While the prognosis for most patients is favorable, recovery can often take weeks or even months. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26955&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26955) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/pericarditis/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26955) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26955/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26955) [![Image ](/books/NBK431080/bin/Figure__1.gif)](/books/NBK431080/figure/article-26955.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK431080/figure/article-26955.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Electrocardiographic Findings in Acute Pericarditis Contributed by L Chhabra, MD ## References 1.
