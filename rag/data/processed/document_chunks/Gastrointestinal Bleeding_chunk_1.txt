curvature, within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, as this region receives its arterial blood supply directly from the branches of the left gastric artery.[3] Less commonly, extra-gastric lesions may also arise in the duodenum, colon, jejunum, esophagus, or surgical anastomosis site.[4] Bleeding from a Dieulafoy lesion is most commonly associated with comorbid conditions like cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic use of certain drugs(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) and anticoagulants).[5] ## Epidemiology Dieulafoy lesion accounts for 6.5% of the causes of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.[2] In adults, they are found twice as frequently in men as in women (2 to 1).[6] In the pediatric population, they occur in an equal distribution among the male and female populations.[7] The lesions reportedly present in all age groups; however, they are most common in the elderly in their fifth decade of life with multiple comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus.[5] ## Pathophysiology There are several possible theories about the mechanism that results in the development of Dieulafoy lesions and their complications. The three main theories include the following: - Pulsations of an abnormally large artery may disrupt the mucosal surface leading to exposure of the artery to the bowel contents resulting in mechanical and chemical erosion and bleeding[8] - Wear and tear of the gastric mucosa may lead to arterial thrombus formation resulting in necrosis and bleeding. - Age-related gastric mucosal atrophy Several factors appear to trigger the rupture of the tortuous vessel, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tobacco, alcohol, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD); however, there is no proven association yet. ## Histopathology A biopsy is not recommended for the diagnosis of Dieulafoy lesions due to an increased risk of bleeding. Histological examination of the lesion in the past revealed a normal artery with the presence of occasional amyloid deposits.[9] Macroscopically, the lesion resembles a pseudopolyp. Lesions that are actively bleeding have a wide arterial size of 1 to 2 mm, with arterial spurting and mucosal erosions measuring up to 5 mm. Microscopically, the artery has an elastic lamina and impinges on the muscularis mucosae. Dieulafoy lesion can be distinguished from gastric ulcers on histology by a lack of subintimal fibrosis and mucosal inflammation.[10] ## History and Physical Dieulafoy lesions are often asymptomatic unless the mucosa overlying the vessel erodes, resulting in bleeding. The signs and symptoms are related to blood
