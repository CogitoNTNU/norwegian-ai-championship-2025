There has been more and more demand from patients and physicians to perform a fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture. Hence, health professionals should understand the indications, contraindications. They should be familiar with the methods of fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture. This activity reviews indications, pre-procedure assessment of the patient, details of techniques used by the interprofessional team, and the potential complications. **Objectives:** - Review the indications for the lumbar puncture. - Review the indications for the fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture. - Identify the high-risk factors and contraindications for the lumbar puncture. - Summarize the material and techniques for the lumbar puncture procedure.

Currently, radiologists are becoming the largest provider for LP.[2] There is an increasing trend of performing LP under image guidance in hospital settings.[3] Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is the most common imaging method. Physicians have used computed tomography (CT) guidance lumbar puncture in certain difficult situations. FGLP is necessary when a patient has spinal hardware, scoliosis, and severe degenerative changes. Prior failed attempts and inability to find the bony landmarks such as in obese patients also require image guidance for the procedure.[2] FGLP is associated with a 3.5% frequency of a traumatic tap, which is much lower than the 10.1% associated with the blind bedside technique.[4] ## Anatomy and Physiology While performing an LP, the needle has to pass through the skin, subcutaneous fat, paraspinal fascia, muscles and then epidural fat, and the dura.[5] The thecal sac is an extension of the subarachnoid space of the brain. In the spinal canal, the thecal sac is formed by the outer dura and inner arachnoid mater. The thecal sac contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the spinal cord
