a common and potentially life-threatening surgical emergency that accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. This condition is characterized by the triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension, reflecting the disruption of normal intestinal flow. SBO can be broadly categorized into simple obstructions, which involve mechanical blockage without ischemia, and strangulated obstructions, which are associated with compromised blood flow, bowel ischemia, and potential necrosis. Prompt diagnosis and management are critical to prevent severe complications, including gangrenous bowel and perforation. The most common cause of SBO is postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, while other etiologies include malignancies, inflammatory strictures, and congenital anomalies. Initial management includes fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, nasogastric tube decompression, and early identification of strangulation.[1] Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Nonoperative management is often effective for partial obstructions, while surgical intervention, such as adhesiolysis or bowel resection, is required in cases of complete obstruction, ischemia, or perforation.[2] This activity examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management strategies for SBO, emphasizing evidence-based practices and recent advances in care. ## Etiology The etiology of SBO encompasses a broad spectrum of mechanical and functional causes, each impacting management strategies and timing of surgical intervention. Mechanical SBO results from a physical barrier to the passage of bowel contents and can be classified based on the location of the obstruction: intraluminal, such as gallstone ileus; intramural, such as malignant lesions; and extrinsic, such as adhesions. In contrast, functional obstruction, termed ileus or paralytic ileus, arises from impaired peristalsis or metabolic disorders rather than a physical barrier. **Adhesions** Postoperative adhesions are the leading cause of SBO in developed countries, accounting for up to 74% of cases, and are the second leading cause in developing nations.[3] They result from fibrotic scar tissue forming after surgeries, which occur in as many as 97% of common surgeries such as appendectomy, colectomy, and gynecological surgery.[4] Adhesions are also seen after laparoscopic surgeries, though less frequently than open procedures. SBO that is secondary to adhesions in an abdomen without prior surgery, ie, a “virgin abdomen,” is very rarely seen but may occur in conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever and recurrent serositis.[5] The rarity of these types of SBO can result in a delay in diagnosis with complications leading to sepsis and death, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical suspicion and timely imaging for diagnosis **Hernias** Abdominal
