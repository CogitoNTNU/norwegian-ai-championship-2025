that may not be clinically apparent.[1] Among patients aged 70 or older hospitalized with pneumonia, dysphagia prevalence was reported at 91.7%, with silent aspirations occurring in over 50% of cases. However, advanced age does not directly predict the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Frailty, poor nutritional status, and limited mobility are considered more reliable indicators of aspiration risk in older patients.[3] According to various estimates, the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in specific patient populations is as follows: - Acute stroke patients: between 3% and 50% [1] - Post-cerebrovascular event silent aspiration: Occurs in 40% to 70% of cases [3] - Hospitalized patients with Parkinson disease or dementia: up to 11% over 3 months [1] - Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, Huntington disease, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy.[1] - Head and neck cancer and its treatment increase the aspiration pneumonia risk, with up to 70% of patients developing aspiration pneumonia during their lifetime. This risk in survivors further increases with time.[1] In addition to the above predisposing factors, a crucial risk factor for aspiration pneumonia is the degree of bacterial colonization in oral secretions. Even minimal aspiration can lead to infection if there's a high density of bacterial colonization in oropharyngeal secretions, providing ample "bacterial load" for inoculation. A population-based case-control study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) noted poor oral health as a risk factor for infection. Similarly, poor oral health has been established as a significant risk factor for aspiration pneumonia among hospitalized patients.[3] ## Epidemiology The variability among patients with aspiration and inconsistent diagnostic practices pose challenges in determining the true incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Data suggests that up to 20% of individuals in the US experience some degree of impaired swallowing, contributing to approximately 0.4% of all hospital admissions being attributed to aspiration pneumonia.[1] The incidence of aspiration pneumonia among patients with CAP ranges between 5% and 15.5% in the US, United Kingdom, and Korea. However, studies from Japan report a notably higher incidence, around 60%, among patients presenting with CAP. Moreover, aspiration pneumonia among patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in Japan is approximately.[2] In patients under 80, an aspiration event leads to pneumonia only 5% of the time, whereas patients older than 80 develop pneumonia 10% of the time following such an event. Notably, among nursing home residents diagnosed with pneumonia, 18% to 30% of cases are associated with an
