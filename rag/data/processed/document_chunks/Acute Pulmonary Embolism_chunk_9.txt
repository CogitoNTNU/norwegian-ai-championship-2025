test for suspected PE, mainly performed for patients in whom CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive or when additional testing is needed. A normal chest radiograph is usually required before V/Q scanning. Scans performed on patients with abnormal chest radiographs are likely false positives because the images do not appear normal or a low probability of PE in such patients is present. V/Q scanning remains the test of choice for diagnosing PE in pregnancy for those with a normal chest radiograph. Other patients include those with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and those with severe renal failure.[44] Planar lung scan results are frequently classified into 3 tiers: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and nondiagnostic scan.[44][45] Multiple studies have suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan.[46] An analysis from the PIOPED II study advocated that a high-probability V/Q scan can confirm PE. However, the positive predictive value of a high-probability V/Q scan is not enough to confirm the PE diagnosis in patients with a low clinical probability.[47] The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they require further diagnostic testing. **Pulmonary angiography** In pulmonary angiography, contrast is injected via a catheter introduced into the right heart under fluoroscopy, which was the gold standard in the past for diagnosing PE. The diagnosis of acute PE is made on the evidence of a thrombus, either as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch or a filling defect.[48] With the widespread emergence of CTPA, pulmonary angiography is infrequently used and reserved for rare circumstances for patients with a high clinical probability of PE, in whom CTPA or V/Q scanning is nondiagnostic. Pulmonary angiography seems inferior to CTPA; the results are operator-dependent and highly variable.[49] Therefore, catheter-based pulmonary angiography is performed in patients who need therapeutic benefit since it helps with diagnosis and therapeutic interventions aimed at clot lysis. **Magnetic resonance angiography** Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) regarding suspected PE has been assessed for several years. However, large-scale studies show that this promising technique is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE due to its low sensitivity, low availability in most emergency settings, and the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans.[50] However, clinicians may consider this imaging option to evaluate PE in patients in whom neither CTPA nor V/Q scan can be performed.
