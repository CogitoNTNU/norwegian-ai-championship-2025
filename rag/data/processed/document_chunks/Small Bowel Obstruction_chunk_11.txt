unclear, a contrast-enhanced study may be performed: - Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through - This is useful if there is a suspicion of a partial obstruction or when evaluating the motility of the bowel. - Barium enema - This is rarely used in acute SBO but can help visualize obstruction in the colon or ileocecal valve. **Other Diagnostic Tests** - Endoscopy - In some cases, especially if there is a concern for a nonmechanical cause such as a malignancy, endoscopic evaluation (eg, upper endoscopy or colonoscopy) may be performed. This is particularly useful for evaluating patients suspected of tumors or foreign bodies causing the obstruction. - Diagnostic laparoscopy - In cases where the etiology of the SBO is unclear or there is a suspicion of strangulation, peritonitis, or ischemia, diagnostic laparoscopy may be employed. This minimally invasive operation allows direct visualization of the abdominal cavity, aiding in the diagnosis of the cause and in planning surgical intervention. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - MRI is occasionally used, particularly in special circumstances such as with patients who are pregnant or when CT is contraindicated. This study provides detailed soft tissue imaging and can be useful for detecting complications like ischemia or tumors. ## Treatment / Management The treatment and management of SBO require a multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes early recognition and intervention to optimize patient outcomes. **Initial Resuscitation** The initial management of SBO begins with fluid resuscitation to address hypovolemia caused by third-spacing of fluids, vomiting, and reduced oral intake. Isotonic intravenous fluids, such as lactated Ringer or normal saline, are administered to restore intravascular volume and correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nasogastric tube decompression is employed to alleviate gastric distension and vomiting, reduce the risk of aspiration, and provide symptomatic relief. In prolonged cases or when surgery is delayed, nutritional support via enteral or parenteral routes may be necessary to prevent malnutrition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gut flora, including gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, should be administered, particularly when strangulation or perforation is suspected.[28][29][30] Surgical consultation should be obtained promptly, as many cases of SBO, especially those involving complete obstruction or signs of ischemia, require operative management.[31] **Nonoperative Management** Nonoperative or conservative management is suitable for simple SBO without signs of ischemia, peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. This approach involves bowel rest with the patient kept nil per os to minimize bowel distension. Serial monitoring of vital signs,
