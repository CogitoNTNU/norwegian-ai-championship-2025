with refractory symptoms that interfere with daily life or recurrent hospitalization despite targeted guideline-directed medical therapy. For stage C and stage D HF patients, the following NYHA classification of HF symptoms should be used: - **Class I** : Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity - **Class II** : Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity - **Class III** : Symptom onset with minimal activity - ``` * Class III a: No dyspnea at rest ``` - Class III b: Recent onset of dyspnea at rest - **Class IV** : Symptoms at rest [2] ## Etiology **Heart Failure Etiologies** The etiologies of HF are extensive, though coronary artery disease (CAD) causing ischemic heart disease is the most common cause. Every attempt should be made to identify causative factors to help guide treatment strategies. The etiologies can be broadly classified as intrinsic heart disease and pathologies that are infiltrative, congenital, valvular, myocarditis-related, high-output failure, and secondary to systemic disease.[3][4] These classifications have significant overlap. The 4 most common etiologies responsible for about two-thirds of HF cases are ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertensive heart disease, and rheumatic heart disease. Higher-income countries have higher rates of ischemic heart disease and COPD; lower-income countries have higher rates of hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and myocarditis. **Ischemic heart disease** Ischemic heart disease is by far the most common cause of HF worldwide. Ischemia leads to a lack of blood flow to heart muscles, reducing the EF. Incidence is increasing in developing countries as they adopt a more Western diet and lifestyle, and improved medical care decreases the infectious burden in these countries (myocarditis is often infection-related.) **Valvular heart disease** Valvular heart disease is another common intrinsic heart condition that can cause HF. Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in children and young adults worldwide. It is caused by an immune response to group A Streptococcus and primarily causes mitral and aortic stenosis.[5] Age-related degeneration is the most common overall cause of valvular disease, and the aortic valve is the most commonly affected. Women are more likely to experience mitral valve rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse, while men are more likely to suffer from aortic valve diseases such as regurgitation or stenosis. Endocarditis is also more common in men. **Hypertension** Hypertension causes HF even in the absence of CAD
