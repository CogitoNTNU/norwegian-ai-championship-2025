neurologic abnormality - Suspected structural defect in the brain - Enlarged head - Severe head injury ## Treatment / Management No specific treatment for simple or complex febrile seizures is indicated other than supportive care and evaluation for possible underlying conditions causing the fever. Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent a recurrence of febrile seizures. In those who have recurrent febrile seizures, prevention is challenging. A few studies have examined the treatment with benzodiazepines as a bridging measure for a few days during subsequent febrile events; however, the adverse effects outweighed the potential benefits. Therefore, benzodiazepines are not a recommended preventative measure.[19][20][21] Although most febrile seizures are a single occurrence and spontaneously resolve, febrile status epilepticus does occasionally occur in \<10% of children during the first febrile seizure. In patients with febrile status epilepticus or seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes, intravenous benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam can be used.[21][22] Furthermore, nonpharmacological methods (eg, removing clothing, directly fanning the child, and tepid sponging) to reduce a fever have not prevented fever recurrence.[23] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of febrile seizures includes: - Breath-holding spells - CNS infections (eg, aseptic meningitis, viral or bacterial meningitis, and encephalitis) - Drug-induced - Febrile delirium - Febrile myoclonus - Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) - Generalized/genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) - Metabolic disturbances such as hyponatremia - Shaking chills or rigors - Simple febrile seizure - Tonic-clonic seizures ## Prognosis Febrile seizures are typically harmless and do not cause long-term neurological or cognitive problems. The majority of children who experience febrile seizures have normal developmental outcomes. Studies suggest that around 30% of children with a history of febrile seizures are at an increased risk of having recurrent episodes. Children younger than 12 months at the time of their first febrile seizure have a 50% chance of experiencing a second seizure within the first year. However, this risk decreased to 30% in the following year. Factors such as young age during the initial seizure, a family history of febrile seizures, low fever intensity during the seizure, and a short interval between fever onset and the seizure may indicate a higher likelihood of recurrent febrile seizures. On the other hand, features associated with complex febrile seizures do not necessarily increase the risk of recurrence. Approximately 1% to 2% of children with simple febrile seizures, which is only slightly higher
