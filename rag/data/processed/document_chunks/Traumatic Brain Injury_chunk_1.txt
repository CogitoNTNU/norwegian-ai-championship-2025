These injuries frequently impact the frontal and temporal brain regions, leading to substantial healthcare burdens, particularly in lower-income countries.[1][2][3][4] TBI severity is classified into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild TBI or concussion is clinically defined as a loss of consciousness lasting \<30 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia lasting \<24 hrs, or any alteration of consciousness. Moderate or severe TBI is clinically defined as a loss of consciousness lasting ≥ 30 minutes to prolonged coma, post-traumatic amnesia lasting ≥24 hours up to permanently, or a Glasgow Coma score as low as 3. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is also used in the description of those with TBI. It is scored out of 15, where it is defined as mild when the GCS is 14-15, moderate when the GCS is 9-12, and severe when the GCS is 3-8. A mild TBI (otherwise known as a concussion) comprises over 90% of the cases.[5][6] Symptoms vary widely, from transient consciousness to prolonged unconsciousness or coma in severe cases. Long-term risks include persistent postconcussive symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Recurrent TBIs can lead to cumulative, permanent neurologic damage and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), emphasizing the critical need for research and education to understand the long-term effects of TBI.[7][8][9][10][9] ## Etiology Traumatic brain injuries can occur from minor impacts or blows to the head, large blows from significant impact, and penetrating injuries to the head. TBI can also occur secondary to rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain without impact, resulting in diffuse axonal injury (DAI), and can be very debilitating. [11][12] Depending on the scenario, they can all lead to various degrees of TBI. Statistically, falls are the most common cause of TBI, responsible for 49% of TBI-related emergency department visits in children aged 0 to 17 years and 81% in adults aged 65 years and older. The second most common cause of TBI is motor vehicle collisions/traffic-related injuries, followed by sports or work-related injuries and assaults.[13][14] For patients requiring hospitalization due to TBI, falls account for 52% of cases, while motor vehicle accidents are responsible for 20%.[15] Penetrating and blast-related head injuries are the most lethal form of head trauma.[16] ## Epidemiology It is reported that almost 70 million individuals are estimated to suffer from some form of TBI, which is seen more commonly in males than females and occurs more in children, adults up to 24 years, and
