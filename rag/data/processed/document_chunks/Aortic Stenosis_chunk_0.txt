Etiologies include congenital (bicuspid/unicuspid), calcific, and rheumatic disease. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea or fatigue gradually develop after a long asymptomatic latent period of about 10 to 20 years. Patients go on to develop chest pain, heart failure, and syncope. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of aortic stenosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of aortic stenosis. - Outline the appropriate evaluation of aortic stenosis. - Review the indications for different types of management options available for aortic stenosis. - Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving communication and care coordination to advance the aortic stenosis condition.

Etiologies include congenital (bicuspid/unicuspid), calcific, and rheumatic disease. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea or fatigue gradually develop after a long asymptomatic latent period of about 10 to 20 years. Patients go on to develop chest pain, heart failure, and syncope. The definitive treatment for aortic stenosis includes aortic valve replacement, either via a surgical or percutaneous approach. Survival is excellent during the asymptomatic phase, but mortality is more than 90% within a few years after the onset of symptoms.[2][3][4][5][6][7] ## Etiology **Congenital** A congenitally abnormal valve with superimposed calcification can cause aortic stenosis.[8] The bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients less than the age of 70 years in developed countries. **Acquired** Rheumatic valve disease is the most common cause in developing countries.[8] The commissures of the leaflets fuse to leave a small central orifice. Other causes include calcification of the tri-leaflet valve, alkaptonuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, ochronosis, irradiation, homozygous type II lipoproteinemia, and metabolic diseases such as Fabry disease.[9][10] Mineral metabolism disturbances, such as end-stage renal disease, have also been
