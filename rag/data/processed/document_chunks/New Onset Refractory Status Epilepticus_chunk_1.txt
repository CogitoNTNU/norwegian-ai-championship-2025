to SRSE, with in-hospital mortality reported to be as high as 40% to 54%.[6][7][8] The term new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) was first used by Wilder-Smith et al. in 2005 to describe cases of SRSE with no associated past medical history of epilepsy and with no identifiable cause despite initial evaluation.[9] In 2018 an international group of experts proposed a consensus definition of NORSE and related conditions to allow a more standardized terminology to improve patient management and clinical research. NORSE is defined as a “clinical presentation characterized by new onset of refractory status epilepticus, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurological disorder (acute strokes, brain masses, drug overdoses, etc.), and without a clear acute or active structural, toxic or metabolic cause.” A closely related condition, febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), has been defined as a subset of NORSE, associated with a prior febrile infection, with fever starting between 2 weeks to 24 hours before the onset of RSE.[10] In contrast, patients with NORSE may or may not be associated with fever before the start of RSE. ## Etiology In a large retrospective review, consisting of 130 NORSE cases, an etiology was not identified in 52% of cases despite an extensive evaluation. These cases were termed as “cryptogenic NORSE” or “NORSE of unknown etiology.”[11] The most common etiologies included autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis followed by infections. - **Non-paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis** - The most frequently detected antibodies include anti-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, anti-VGKC (voltage-gated potassium complex), anti-LGI1, and less commonly anti-Caspr2. Other autoimmune antibodies that have been found in patients with NORSE include - Anti-GABA, Anti-glycine, Anti-GAD65, Anti-striational, and steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT). - **Paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis** - Anti NMDA receptor-associated encephalitis is the most common in this category. Young females are predominantly affected, and 50% of cases are associated with germ cell tumors like ovarian teratoma. Other antibodies that have been identified include anti-Hu (small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma), anti-CRMP5 (small cell lung cancer), anti-Ma2 (germ cell tumor of testis), anti-amphiphysin (breast cancer, small cell lung cancer), and anti-VGCC (small cell lung cancer, thymoma). - **Infections** - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common etiology identified in NORSE amongst infectious agents. Enterovirus, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Bartonella henselae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and arboviruses (West Nile virus) have also been detected in patients with NORSE. - Some
