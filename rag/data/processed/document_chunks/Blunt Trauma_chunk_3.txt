heard by those with normal hearing.[11] Many insights regarding AAT can be drawn from similar clinical scenarios, such as sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss and ototoxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. Both conditions share common mechanisms involving the development of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, free radicals, and oxidative stress.[12] The most effective initial step in preserving hearing for patients exposed to AAT is hearing protection. Hearing protection devices (HPDs) can significantly reduce noise levels at these frequencies. HPDs can be classified as either passive or active. Both military and civilian leaders and clinicians strongly recommend using HPDs to prevent temporary threshold shifts and permanent hearing loss.[13] **Passive Hearing Protection Devices** Passive HPDs rely on physical barriers without embedded electronics and function in 2 ways, as mentioned below. - Noise level–dependent HPDs: - These HPDs, such as solid earplugs, provide attenuation that varies with noise intensity. - Noise level–independent HPDs: - Provide consistent noise reduction across different frequencies and intensities. - Feature a narrow inner channel along the earplug’s length, causing acoustic impedance to increase nonlinearly with external sound. - Nonlinear HPDs reduce harmful impulse noise while allowing speech and softer sounds to remain audible for communication and safety. **Active Hearing Protection Devices** Active HPDs work differently, using noise reduction algorithms within electronic devices to cancel noise actively. These devices optimize the signal-to-noise ratio to enhance the desired result, such as speech and communication amid noisy environments. These devices combine passive components, such as physical barriers, with active elements, such as preamplifiers and microphones. Some models also feature external signal processors, operating switches, and volume controls for added functionality. Active HPDs feature directional microphones that enhance communication and hearing protection. However, they can impair sound localization, particularly from behind—referred to as a soldier’s “6” in combat. The impact of blast-type noises varies based on proximity, device type, and whether the environment is open or enclosed. Diagnosing hearing loss from AAT requires audiological evaluation and access to high-quality equipment. Advances in technology, such as smartphone screening apps and audiometric headsets, may enhance future diagnostic capabilities. Patients with suspected AAT presenting with symptoms such as acute tinnitus, muffled hearing, or ear fullness should undergo a comprehensive head and neck examination, including a detailed otologic evaluation, ideally with otomicroscopy. Audiometric testing is the primary diagnostic tool and should be performed if hearing loss persists beyond 72 hours. Cortical evoked response audiometry may be indicated for patients
