VGS and _S. gallolyticus_ (_bovis_) with MIC greater than 0.12 to less than 0.5 mcg/ml - A defective and Granulicatella species, and VGS with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 0.5 mcg/ml - VGS or _S. gallolyticus_ involving prosthetic material - Staphylococci, Staphylococci involving prosthetic material - Enterococci, HACEK micro-organisms - Non-HACEK gram-negative bacilli, culture-negative endocarditis, and fungi Recommendations for antimicrobial therapy, according to the causative pathogen are complex and well summarized in the 2015 American Heart Association practice guidelines.[8] Treatment for left-sided infective endocarditis (aortic and mitral) is similar, and the recommendations are based on the pathogen, its susceptibility, timeline (acute vs. subacute), and whether it is native or prosthetic valve infective endocarditis. Generally speaking, for subacute native valve infective endocarditis, _S. viridans_ and _enterococci_ need to be covered, and the usual treatment involves IV penicillin (2.4 g, every 4 hours) for up to 4 weeks with gentamicin (1 mg/kg, every 12 hours) for 2 weeks (for suspected aminoglycoside-susceptible enterococci). Adjunctive therapy with aminoglycosides for native valve infective endocarditis is not recommended because of the risk of renal toxicity and because it doesnâ€™t decrease mortality. Likewise, rifampin is not recommended because of the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, if the culprit is aminoglycoside-susceptible enterococci, then gentamicin can be added to the regimen.[9] Additionally, for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, the combination therapy of vancomycin and aminoglycoside or rifampin is acceptable. For acute native valve, infective endocarditis treatment _S. aureus_ needs to be covered. The treatment includes nafcillin for methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA) or cefazolin if patients are allergic to nafcillin. For methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), vancomycin is the recommended antibiotic. The alternative is daptomycin, which requires closer monitoring for dosing. _Candida_ and _Aspergillus_ may respond to medical therapy 5-fluorouracil and amphotericin B respectively, however, these patients frequently require surgical therapy. Among patients with mechanical valve endocarditis who have experienced a central nervous system embolic event, it is reasonable to discontinue for 2 weeks all forms of anticoagulation.[8] If medical therapy fails, surgical intervention is often necessary. Class I indications for surgery in patients with infective endocarditis include valvular dysfunction with symptoms of congestive heart failure, left-sided infective endocarditis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ , fungal, or other highly resistant microorganisms, infective endocarditis with conduction defects or heart block, annular or aortic abscess, persistent infection 5 to 7 days after initiation of antibiotic therapy [10]. For native valve endocarditis, eradication of the
