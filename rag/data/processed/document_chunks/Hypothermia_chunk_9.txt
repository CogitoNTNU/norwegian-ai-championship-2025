of respiration. Resuscitation must be initiated right away in such individuals. - Most commercial thermometers can only read to a minimum of 34 °C, making a special low-reading thermometer necessary during patient examination. - The esophageal thermometer is the most accurate way of determining a patient’s temperature. - Rectal temperatures take up to 1 hour to adjust to core temperature changes. - Patients with hyperkalemia may not show the typical ECG changes associated with elevated potassium levels. - Coagulation tests may be inaccurate unless the patient has been warmed to 37 °C. - ECG may show J waves in patients with hypothermia. - Cardiopulmonary bypass and ECMO are the most invasive but effective ways to rewarm a hemodynamically unstable patient. - If the patient fails to rewarm despite appropriate rewarming techniques, underlying causes like hypoglycemia, infection, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency must be investigated. Importantly, hypothermia is avoidable. Patient education on preventive measures is crucial, especially when caring for vulnerable individuals. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Hypothermia is potentially lethal if not quickly recognized and treated. Managing the condition requires a multidisciplinary team. Emergency medical services (EMS) provide the patient with initial treatment in the prehospital setting. EMS personnel are often the first healthcare professionals that patients with hypothermia encounter. Afterward, patients are taken to the emergency department, where the emergency medicine physicians and nurses further stabilize patients. A highly trained emergency unit best accomplishes resuscitation and quick rewarming. After stabilization, emergency medicine physicians also investigate associated injuries and send referrals to specialists when appropriate. Hypothermic patients are prone to many complications, often requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Nurses provide continuous monitoring at the ICU, administer medications and fluids, and coordinate care. A pulmonologist and cardiologist may co-manage respiratory and cardiovascular complications, respectively. Nephrologists' services may be required if hemodialysis is warranted. Surgeons may be needed to debrid severe frostbites. Cardiothoracic specialists may perform cardiopulmonary bypass or ECMO if necessary.[13] Respiratory therapists assist in treating breathing problems if present. Pharmacists dispense prescription medications. After discharge, the primary care doctor oversees the patients' general health needs and monitors for complications. Physical and occupational therapists help in patient rehabilitation. Seamless coordination between these healthcare providers ensures the best outcomes for patients who have had hypothermia. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23300&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23300) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/hypothermia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23300) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23300/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23300) [![Osborn Wave On
