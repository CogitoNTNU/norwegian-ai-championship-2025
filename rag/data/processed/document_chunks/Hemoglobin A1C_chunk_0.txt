The test shows average blood sugar levels over the past 90 days, expressed as a percentage. In addition, it can be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus.[1] Hemoglobin is a protein found exclusively in red blood cells, giving blood its bright red color. The primary role of hemoglobin is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all the cells in the body. Hemoglobin becomes glycated or coated with glucose from the bloodstream. As blood glucose levels increase, more glucose attaches to the hemoglobin protein, resulting in a higher A1c value.[2] Since red blood cells have an average lifespan of about 3 months, the A1c test measures hemoglobin levels in the bloodstream over this period, making it a reliable indicator of blood sugar control. ## Etiology and Epidemiology The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a landmark study that provided extensive data on A1c and its correlation to blood glucose levels, establishing specific treatments to target A1c goals. Following the completion of the trial, the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) was formed to define a standardized assay for A1c measurement across laboratories. The DCCT trial reported that a higher mean A1c level was the dominant predictor of diabetic retinopathy progression.[3][4] Tighter glucose control, indicated by HbA1c levels at or below 7%, was correlated with a 35 to 76% decrease in microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in patients with type 1 diabetes. In addition to predicting the progression of microvascular complications through A1c levels, the DCCT extension into the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study showed long-term benefits in cardiovascular risk and mortality for patients with lower HbA1c levels.[5][6] ## Pathophysiology Regular A1c testing is essential for individuals with diabetes mellitus to ensure their average blood glucose levels are within the target range. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that individuals with diabetes mellitus who have stable blood sugar control and are meeting treatment goals should have
