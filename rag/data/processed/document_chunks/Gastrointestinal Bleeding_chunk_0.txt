It is an enlarged submucosal blood vessel that bleeds in the absence of any abnormality, such as ulcers or erosions. The signs and symptoms are related to blood loss, either due to intermittent or massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. To avoid the complications associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of Dieulafoy lesions and highlights the healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the pathophysiology of Dieulafoy lesions. - Summarize the epidemiology of Dieulafoy lesions. - Describe the typical imaging findings associated with Dieulafoy lesions. - Outline the typical presentation of a patient with Dieulafoy lesions.

The protrusion results in a small wall defect in GIT with fibrinoid necrosis at the base of the lesion; 70% of these lesions are found in the stomach, usually along the lesser curvature. ## Etiology A Dieulafoy lesion is an enlarged submucosal blood vessel that bleeds in the absence of any abnormality such as ulcers or erosions. The majority of the lesions arise in the stomach at the lesser curvature, within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, as this region receives its arterial blood supply directly from the branches of the left gastric artery.[3] Less commonly, extra-gastric lesions may also arise in the duodenum, colon, jejunum, esophagus, or surgical anastomosis site.[4] Bleeding from a Dieulafoy lesion is most commonly
