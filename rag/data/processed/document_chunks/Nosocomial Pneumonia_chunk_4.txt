that HAP is associated with an increased risk of death. The all-cause mortality associated with VAP ranges from 20 to 50% in different studies. Variables associated with increased mortality include: - The severity of illness at the time of diagnosis (eg., shock, coma, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome) - Bacteremia - The underlying co-morbidities[10] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) requires an interprofessional team of specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, anesthesiologists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers, including nurses and pharmacists, caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Without proper management, the morbidity and mortality from HAP and VAP are high.
