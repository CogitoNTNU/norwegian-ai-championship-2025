organization or embolize to systemic circulation - stroke is a potential consequence. With atrial fibrillation, this risk is greatest when converting a patient back to sinus rhythm. The endothelial injury that accompanies valvular lesions also predisposes to hypercoagulability and thrombus formation, with similar potential consequences. The cardiac emboli may consist of cholesterol, thrombus, platelet thrombi, calcium, or even bacterial clumps. Emboli from the heart can be distributed anywhere in the body, but more than 80% migrate to the brain. Of the emboli to the brain, the majority involve the anterior circulation, with only about 20% involving the vertebrobasilar circulation. When emboli enter the brain, they not only obstruct blood flow but may become detached and migrate further distally. Thus, reperfusion is another form of injury. ## History and Physical The classic clinical scenario is that of an abrupt onset neurologic deficit that reaches maximal intensity within minutes and then gradually improves. As with all strokes, the clinical features depend on the extent and location of neurovascular compromise. However, depressed consciousness is usually a factor favoring a cardioembolic etiology instead of an atherothrombotic stroke.[8] Further, eliciting a history of a Valsalva-like maneuver provoking the stroke also supports a cardioembolic etiology.[4] Cardioembolic strokes cause more seizures due to distal ischemia. Classic features of cardioembolic stroke include the following: - Abrupt decline in mental status - Change in the level of consciousness - Presence of neurological deficits Cardiac findings may include: - Atrial fibrillation - Presence of a cardiac murmur - Signs of congestive heart failure - Recent myocardial infarction - Recent diagnosis of infective endocarditis ## Evaluation **Cardiac Evaluation** The preliminary cardiac evaluation must be directed towards evaluating both the electrophysiologic status of the heart as well as structural and functional status. As such, workup must include a 12-lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiography for all patients. **Electrophysiologic Assessment** - A 12-lead ECG is useful only to the extent of detecting ongoing arrhythmias. Additionally, it may provide useful insight into ventricular myocardial status (evidence of ventricular hypertrophy) as well as indicate prior cardiac ischemic episodes. However, transient arrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, will be missed. - Holter monitoring has now become a part of the baseline evaluation of all cases of suspected cardioembolic strokes. Fundamentally similar to an ECG, it has the same drawback of evaluating the conduction system for a relatively limited period of 24 hours. - Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can
