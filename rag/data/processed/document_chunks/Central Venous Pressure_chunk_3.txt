the central venous pressure can be seen in the assessment of cardiocirculatory status. Elevated CVP will present clinically as a pulsation of the internal jugular vein when a patient is inclined at 45 degrees; however, it can be noted in an upright patient in severe cases. Elevated CVP is indicative of myocardial contractile dysfunction and/or fluid retention. On the other hand, low central venous pressure is indicative of volume depletion or decreased venous tone. The central venous pressure, despite its numerous limitations, is consistently used universally to guide fluid resuscitation. The ease of determination of the central venous pressure makes it a clinically attractive, albeit non-specific, indicator of fluid status. As such, other indices, such as the inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVC CI), must be used adjunctively for a more accurate assessment of volume status [8] In addition, CVP has been found to be inversely correlated with the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients (with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 55%) thus, TAPSE may be used as a surrogate marker of CVP [9]. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=19150&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=19150) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/19150/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=19150) [![Central venous pressure Image courtesy O](/books/NBK519493/bin/CVPa.gif)](/books/NBK519493/figure/article-19150.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK519493/figure/article-19150.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Central venous pressure Image courtesy O.Chaigasame ## References 1.
