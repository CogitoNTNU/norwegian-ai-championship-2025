fluid for resuscitation has little bearing on outcomes but the key is to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. Patients with sepsis are prone to many complications, which have high mortality. Thus, close monitoring and prevention of these complications are vital. Primary disorders like diabetes and renal or liver failure must be treated. Drugs that affect the immune system should be discontinued. The dietitian should be consulted as there is good evidence that early enteral nutrition is beneficial. The nurse should ensure DVT and pressure sore prophylaxis. The nurse should also monitor all catheters for infection and remove those that are not needed. The pharmacists should follow culture results and ensure the patient is on organism-sensitive antibiotics. Clinicians should maintain aseptic techniques during procedures, and hand washing should be practiced. The entire team should communicate with each other to ensure that the patient is receiving optimal care. The outcomes of septic shock depend on patient age, associated comorbidities, renal function, need for dialysis, requiring mechanical ventilation, and response to treatment. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=28981&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=28981) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/septic-shock/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=28981) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/28981/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=28981) ## References 1.
