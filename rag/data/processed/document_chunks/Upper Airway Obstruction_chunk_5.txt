are excellent. Airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. In some cases, deaths have been reported. The longer it takes to achieve a patent airway, the greater the risk that the patient may suffer from anoxic brain damage or even a cardiac arrest.[2][11][12] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17310&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17310) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/ear-nose-and-throat/airway-obstruction/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17310) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17310/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17310) [![First aid technique for clearing the airways](/books/NBK470562/bin/Tongue-blocking-airways.gif)](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470562/figure/article-17310.image.f1/?report=objectonly) First aid technique for clearing the airways. 1. Tongue has fallen backwards towards the posterior pharynx, blocking the airway. 2. By hyperextending the head and pulling up the chin, the tongue lifts and clears the airway.
