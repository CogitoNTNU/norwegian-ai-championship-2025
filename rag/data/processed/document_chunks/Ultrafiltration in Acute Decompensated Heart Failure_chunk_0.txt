The volume overload can be attributed to medication noncompliance, comorbidities, diet, modifiable risk factors, disease progression, and/or treatment failure. The standard treatment for volume overload in patients with ADHF is usually pharmacologic, involving intravenous (IV) diuresis, mainly with loop diuretics. Extracorporeal ultrafiltration (UF) is an emerging alternative therapy for treating volume overload in acutely decompensated heart failure patients. This activity describes the indications for ultrafiltration in acutely decompensated heart failure patients and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients. **Objectives:** - Review the indications for ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure patients. - Describe the technique involved in performing ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure patients. - Summarize the clinical benefits of ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure. - Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe performance of ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure and improve patient outcomes.

It can be attributed to medication noncompliance, comorbidities, diet, modifiable risk factors, disease progression, and/or treatment failure. The standard treatment is usually pharmacologic involving intravenous (IV) diuresis, mainly with loop diuretics. However, chronic diuretic therapy use is associated with negative neuro-hormonal effects, which may lead to diuretic resistance and worsening renal function, which in turn can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been a growing interest in alternative strategies to manage volume overload in ADHF patients. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to treat volume overload. Extracorporeal ultrafiltration (UF) is, therefore, an emerging alternative therapy of interest for treating volume overload in ADHF patients.[1][2][3][4] ## Anatomy and Physiology Loop diuretics administered intravenously remain the first-line therapy for hospitalized ADHF patients. Loop diuretics inhibit Na+/2Cl-/K+ cotransporter in
