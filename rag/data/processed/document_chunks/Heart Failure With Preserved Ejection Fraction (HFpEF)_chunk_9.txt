drugs of abuse, must be pursued. An assessment of social determinants of health is recommended.[1] Symptoms that patients with heart failure commonly describe include dyspnea, initially with exertion and then at rest. Patients may describe orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.[2][58] Dulled mental status or "brain fog" is not uncommon. Daytime oliguria with resulting nocturia is regularly seen as extravasation of vascular fluid worsens. Peripheral edema of the distal lower extremities may initially resolve with elevation; patients commonly report going to bed with swollen feet that normalize by morning. Eventually, this edema may become pitting. Right upper quadrant pain is sometimes reported and is evidence of liver capsular distention. Anorexia and nausea may be evidence of decreased perfusion of the bowel and bowel edema.[59] Exertional chest pain is also a common presenting symptom.[59] **Physical Examination** Physical examination findings vary with the severity of the heart failure. Patients with isolated HFpEF who are not acutely decompensated are most likely to demonstrate mild systolic hypertension, and approximately 10% to 20% have some degree of jugular venous distention.[58] Evidence of diaphoresis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia are indicative of severe heart failure or acute decompensation.[59] Contrarily, patients with severe decompensation may be hypotensive due to decreased peripheral tissue perfusion.[59] Cardiopulmonary auscultation may reveal rales or an S3 or loud P2 heart sound.[58] Pitting edema of the lower extremities may be observed; presacral pitting edema may be noted in nonambulatory patients. Hepatomegaly may be observed, which may be tender in acute decompensation. A hepatojugular reflex and ascites demonstrable by a fluid wave or changes in abdominal percussion are evidence of significant peripheral congestion. ## Evaluation Exertional dyspnea is a common clinical complaint. The clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure are reported and observed in many disease processes. Additionally, the overt manifestations of HFpEF are common to all subtypes of heart failure, making diagnosing HFpEF challenging.[60] It is reasonable to suspect HFpEF as a possible diagnosis in any patient with exertional dyspnea and one of the following clinical parameters not otherwise explained by an alternative diagnosis: - Age 60 or older - Atrial fibrillation[61] - Chronic kidney disease - Coronary artery disease - Diabetes - Hypertension - Overweight/obesity [1] Diagnostic algorithms such as the HFA-PEFF (Heart Failure Association. **P** retest Assessment, **E** chocardiography and natriuretic peptide, **F** unctional testing, **F** inal etiology) and H2FPEF (**H** eavy, **2** or more hypertensive drugs, atrial **F** ibrillation, **P** ulmonary
