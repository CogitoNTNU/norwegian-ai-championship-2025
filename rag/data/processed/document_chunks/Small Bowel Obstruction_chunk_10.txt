This study can help differentiate between simple and complicated (strangulated or ischemic) SBO. This imaging can be enhanced using intravenous contrast, provided the patient has normal kidney function and no contraindications. Key findings include: - Bowel distention - This appears similar to that on x-rays but is more detailed and can help quantify the extent. - Transition point - This is the location of the obstruction, which is critical in planning surgical or conservative management. - Bowel wall thickening - This finding is suggestive of ischemia, inflammation, or infection. - Mesenteric stranding - In cases of bowel ischemia or perforation, this can be seen. - Signs of perforation - Free air or fluid in the abdomen can indicate perforation. - Absence of contrast in bowel - In cases of a complete obstruction, contrast may not reach beyond the obstruction site. **Ultrasound** Although not typically the first choice for diagnosing SBO, abdominal ultrasound can be useful, particularly in children and pregnant women, due to its noninvasive nature. Additionally, ultrasound does not result in radiation exposure and has the benefit of rapid and serial examinations.[24][25] This study can detect bowel distention, peristalsis, and the presence of fluid or air in the bowel, and is often used in cases of suspected bowel perforation or other intraabdominal pathology. The following are pathological findings that can be seen on ultrasound: - A dilated small bowel loop measuring more than 3 cm in diameter suggests an obstruction or ileus. - An edematous bowel wall measuring more than 3 mm indicates an obstruction or other intestinal inflammatory cause. - The noncompressibility of the bowel and the appearance of free fluid suggest obstruction. - Anterograde-retrograde peristalsis is specific for obstruction. - The visualization of a transition point is specific for obstruction. A transition point on ultrasound is demonstrated by a thick-walled, noncompressible bowel loop adjacent to a loop of decompressed small bowel.[26] Ultrasound does not replace a CT scan and should not delay surgical consultation. This study is useful in cases where it can facilitate diagnostic evaluation and rule out other causes.[27] **Contrast Studies** If the diagnosis remains unclear, a contrast-enhanced study may be performed: - Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through - This is useful if there is a suspicion of a partial obstruction or when evaluating the motility of the bowel. - Barium enema - This is rarely used in acute SBO but can help
