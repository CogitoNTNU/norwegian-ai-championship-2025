The prevalence of the disease approaches 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence when managing AMI. After participating in this activity, clinicians should proficiently identify signs and symptoms of AMI, assess severity and damage using diagnostic tests, apply evidence-based guidelines in AMI management, and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team for comprehensive care, narrowing the practice gap and improving competencies in the prompt recognition and effective management of acute myocardial infarction. **Objectives:** - Identify the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction through comprehensive patient assessment and interpretation of diagnostic findings. - Assess the severity and extent of myocardial damage using diagnostic tests such as electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac biomarkers, and imaging modalities. - Apply evidence-based guidelines and best practices in the management of AMI, including pharmacological and interventional therapies. - Collaborate with a multidisciplinary healthcare team, including cardiologists, nurses, and rehabilitation specialists, to ensure comprehensive care and optimal outcomes for patients with AMI.

The prevalence of the disease approaches 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. AMI can be divided into 2 categories: nonâ€“ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Unstable angina resembles an NSTEMI, but normal cardiac markers distinguish it.[1][2][3] Myocardial infarction (MI) causes permanent damage to the heart muscle due to inadequate oxygen supply. MI can impair diastolic and systolic function, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Additionally, an MI can lead to various serious complications. Prompt reperfusion and restoration of blood flow to the heart are crucial. Early treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset significantly improves prognosis. An MI is diagnosed when 2 of the following criteria are met: 1. Symptoms of ischemia 1. New ST-segment changes
