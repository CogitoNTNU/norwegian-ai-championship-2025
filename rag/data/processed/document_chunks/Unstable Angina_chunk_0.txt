Approximately 9 million patients in the United States have symptoms of angina, though its treatment is challenging. This activity describes the evaluation and management of angina and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Outline the pathophysiology of angina. - Review the evaluation of angina. - Summarize the treatment and management options available for angina. - Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance treatment for angina and improve outcomes.

Chest pain can be due to non-cardiac and cardiac causes, and thorough history and physical is critical in differentiating these causes and identifying patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome. Angina is one of the signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and can further subdivide into stable and unstable angina. Stable angina defines as the occurrence of symptoms with exertion only. Unstable angina or symptoms occurring at rest requires more prompt evaluation and management. Approximately 9 million patients in the United States have symptoms of angina, and recognizing these symptoms is imperative in improving patient outcomes.[1] ## Etiology Chest pain can be due to non-cardiac causes, non-ischemic cardiac disease, and, finally, ischemic cardiac disease. Non-cardiac causes include gastroesophageal reflux disease, lung disease, musculoskeletal causes, and anxiety/panic attacks. Non-ischemic cardiac causes include pericardial disease. The etiology of chest pain caused by cardiac ischemia is largely accepted to be due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries and coronary vasospasm.[1] This condition leads to myocardial oxygen supply and demand mismatch. In stable angina, the increased demand only occurs with exertion, but in unstable angina, it also happens at rest. Increased myocardial oxygen demand from exercise is most notably due to increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and increased myocardial contractility, among other factors.[2] Under normal cardiac physiologic conditions, increased oxygen demand occurring
