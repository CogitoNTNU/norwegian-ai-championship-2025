appearance (platelet-rich) at the site of rupture while appearing red at the margins (composed of red blood cells and fibrin). Thrombus formation involves a complex interplay of different cellular and non-cellular components within the blood. The breakdown of the extracellular matrix is a key factor in the exact cause of plaque rupture, with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) playing a significant role. MMPs contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, leading to positive remodeling and core expansion, which contribute to plaque progression. The initial disruption of fibrillar collagen occurs through the action of MMPs, creating a vulnerability within the plaque. Additionally, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, as well as elastolysis, may also contribute to plaque rupture. These processes collectively contribute to the pathophysiology of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation in conditions such as anterior myocardial infarction.[5] **Plaque Erosion** Plaque erosion is the second most common cause of acute coronary syndrome, differing from plaque rupture by the absence of fibrous cap disintegration or fissure. In plaque erosion, there is a lack of communication between the necrotic core and the luminal thrombus. The thrombus appears white and contains abundant neutrophils, while smooth muscle cells are interspersed. The necrotic core is small, and there is a lack of endothelial lining due to apoptosis. This allows the blood components to encounter the collagen, leading to thrombus formation. The site of plaque erosion is rich in proteoglycan and hyaluronan, in contrast to the site of plaque rupture, which has little. Optical coherence tomography can help differentiate between plaque erosion and rupture.[6] **Microvascular and Coronary Spasm** Spasm is a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome without thrombus formation. In these cases, the constriction of the microvessels or coronary arteries leads to inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, resulting in ischemia and subsequent symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. This phenomenon, often called vasospastic angina or variant angina, can occur spontaneously or be triggered by various factors, such as stress, cold temperatures, or certain medications. **AWMI Risk Factors** - Hypertension - Diabetes mellitus - Smoking - Dyslipidemia - Family history of premature coronary artery disease - Overweight or obesity - Age and gender - Inflammation - Diet - high glycemic index and low fiber, red meat, trans-fatty acid. - Lack of exercise ## Epidemiology The incidence of acute myocardial infarction demonstrates an age-dependent increase and exhibits variation with gender. Findings from the Framingham study revealed that
