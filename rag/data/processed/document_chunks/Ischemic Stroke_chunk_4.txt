nearly $56.5 billion between 2018 and 2019, covering healthcare expenses, medication, and lost productivity due to missed workdays. Stroke stands as a primary contributor to severe long-term disability, particularly affecting mobility in over half of stroke survivors aged 65 and older.[14] Disparities in stroke incidence and outcomes exist across racial and ethnic groups, with non-Hispanic Black adults facing nearly twice the risk of a first stroke compared to White adults, and both non-Hispanic Black and Pacific Islander adults exhibiting the highest stroke-related mortality rates. Moreover, the death rate attributed to stroke rose from 38.8 per 100,000 in 2020 to 41.1 per 100,000 in 2021.[15] ## Pathophysiology In thrombosis, an obstructive process prevents blood flow to regions of the brain. The most common risk factor is large vessel atherosclerosis. Other risk factors include vasculitides and arterial dissection. Embolic events occur when a clot originates from another location in the body. Most commonly, the clot's source is the heart's valve or chambers, for example, when a clot forms within the atria in atrial fibrillation and dislodges into the arterial vascular supply. Less frequent sources include venous, septic, air, or fat emboli. Lacunar infarcts are usually seen in the subcortical areas of the brain supplied by small penetrating or perforating arteries, usually without collaterals. These include the lenticulostriate arteries from the middle cerebral artery, the thalamic perforators from the posterior cerebral artery, and the paramedian branches from the basilar artery. The underlying pathology of these penetrating arteries is small vessel arteriolosclerosis caused by hypertension, aging, smoking, diabetes, and other conventional vascular risk factors.[16] **Cerebral Autoregulation** Under physiological conditions, cerebral blood flow is primarily regulated by the resistance within the cerebral blood vessels, which correlates directly with their diameter. Vasodilation results in increased blood volume within the brain and heightened cerebral blood flow, while vasoconstriction produces the opposite effect.[17] Additionally, cerebral blood flow is influenced by fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral autoregulation denotes the ability to maintain relatively stable cerebral blood flow despite moderate shifts in perfusion pressure.[17][18] The precise mechanisms underlying autoregulation remain incompletely understood and likely involve multiple pathways. Evidence suggests that the smooth muscle in cerebral vessels reacts directly to changes in perfusion pressure by contracting with pressure elevation and relaxing with pressure reduction. Furthermore, decreases in cerebral blood flow may prompt blood vessel dilation by releasing vasoactive substances, although the specific molecules responsible have yet to be identified. Nitric
