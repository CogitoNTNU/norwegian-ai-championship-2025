every 6 hours, with a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen not exceeding 60 mg/kg. **Older patients:** As per the American Geriatric Society, the recommended acetaminophen dosage is 325 to 500 mg every 4 hours or 500 to 1000 mg every 6 hours, with a typical maximum daily dosage of 4 g. In individuals with hepatic impairment or a history of alcohol misuse, it is advisable to reduce the maximum dose by 50% to 75%.[13] ## Adverse Effects Common adverse effects associated with oral or rectal administration of acetaminophen may include skin rash, hypersensitivity reactions, nephrotoxicity characterized by elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia. In addition, it may cause metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, which may manifest as decreased serum bicarbonate, reduced concentrations of sodium and calcium, hyperammonemia, hyperchloremia, hyperuricemia, increased serum glucose, and elevated levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Additional adverse effects associated with IV administration of acetaminophen include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and abdominal pain. Rare but serious adverse effects include hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions, and severe and fatal skin reactions. These include toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.[14] In addition, there have been reported instances of a rare pneumonia resulting from drug-induced lung injury due to acetaminophen.[15] **Drug-Drug Interactions** **Warfarin** : Prolonged oral administration of acetaminophen at 4000 mg/d has been associated with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin. Due to the lack of studies evaluating short-term acetaminophen use with oral anticoagulants, increased frequency of INR monitoring may be advisable in these situations. **Alcohol** : Chronic alcohol misuse increases the risk of acetaminophen toxicity by inducing CYP2E1, reducing hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, and impairing NAPQI detoxification. Moreover, it may decrease glucuronidation, enhance oxidation, cause hepatocyte membrane disruptions, and reduce biliary excretion.[16] ## Contraindications Contraindications to using acetaminophen include hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, severe hepatic impairment, or severe active hepatic disease.[14] **Box Warnings** **Hepatotoxicity:** Acetaminophen use has been associated with liver failure, occasionally resulting in liver transplants or fatalities. The hepatotoxicity observed with acetaminophen use usually corresponds to high doses that surpass the recommended maximum dose.[17][18] This effect may be associated with the consumption of multiple drug products containing acetaminophen as an ingredient. Liver damage has also been documented in patients with chronic acetaminophen dosing. **Dosing errors:** A notable FDA-box warning underscores the importance of preventing dosing errors, especially when administering
