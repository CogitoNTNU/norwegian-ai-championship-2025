continuous variable, strict cut-off points for abnormal values are somewhat arbitrary. As urinary constituents deviate from normal or optimal ranges, the risk of stone formation increases. Below is a summary of the key components of the 24-hour urinalysis and their clinical significance. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/40765)," for more information. **Light-Chain Proteinuria** Light chains, such as Bence-Jones proteins, are used as markers for conditions such as multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and other monoclonal gammopathies affecting the kidneys. Under normal circumstances, these proteins are undetectable in urine, so any positive finding in a 24-hour urine collection is considered abnormal. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Bence-Jones Protein](/pubmed/31082079)" and "[Multiple Myeloma](/pubmed/30521185)," for more information. **Calcium** Elevated urinary calcium levels are found in over a third of patients with calcific stones. Urine calcium concentration is influenced by dietary calcium, sodium, and protein intake, medical comorbidities, kidney function, hormonal influences, and, in some cases, genetic conditions. A moderate calcium intake is recommended to limit excessive urinary calcium excretion, support bone health, and prevent increased oxalate absorption due to reduced intestinal oxalate binding. A very low calcium diet reduces the intestinal binding of oxalate, leading to increased oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria, which significantly promotes calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis formation. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[24-Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Interpretation and Treatment Guidelines](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/40765)," for more information. Depending on the underlying etiology, urinary calcium modulation is typically achieved through dietary adjustments or medications such as thiazides. Optimal urinary calcium levels are generally below 250 mg/d or 150 mg/L of urine. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Hypercalciuria](/pubmed/28846247)," for more information. **Citrate** Citrate is a potent urinary inhibitor of calcium salt crystallization and acts as a urinary alkalinizing agent. Hypocitraturia, a common risk factor for kidney stones, occurs in up to one-third of calcium stone formers. Low urinary citrate levels may result from dietary factors, metabolic acidosis, or hypokalemia, though it can also be idiopathic. Citrate is present in citrus juices such as grapefruit, orange, lemon, and lime. However, most patients with low urinary citrate levels typically require supplementation, often in potassium citrate, as dietary intake alone is usually insufficient to correct the deficiency. Concentrated citrate supplements, such as potassium citrate, are available in tablet and liquid forms. Lower potassium alternatives are also offered, and sodium bicarbonate may be used. Optimal urinary citrate levels are approximately 300 mg/1000 mL of urine or
