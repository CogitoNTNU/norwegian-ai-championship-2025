and may be necessary in severe or refractory chest pain cases. Nitrites should be avoided in patients with systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg, severe bradycardia, suspected RV infarction, and those receiving a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the last 24 hours. **Oxygen** : Maintaining adequate oxygenation is crucial to meet the myocardial oxygen demand. Supplemental oxygen should be considered when the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) falls below 90%. For patients without COPD, supplemental oxygen can be administered at a flow rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute via nasal cannula. This standard starting range can be adjusted based on the patient's response and subsequent oxygen saturation levels. **Analgesia** : Administration of morphine can be beneficial in providing pain relief, alleviating anxiety, and assisting in managing pulmonary edema. **Aspirin** : An initial dose of 162 mg to 325 mg of aspirin is recommended for all patients with AMI before undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It should be continued indefinitely as part of long-term management. **Adjunct antithrombotic therapy for patients presenting to PCI facility:** Antiplatelet therapy with P2Y12 receptor inhibitors is essential to managing myocardial infarction. The choice of specific P2Y12 inhibitor and dosing regimen may vary depending on several factors, including the patient's characteristics and the clinical scenario. The commonly used P2Y12 inhibitors and their recommended dosing regimens are as follows: 1. **Clopidogrel** : - Loading Dose: A loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel should be administered as early as possible or at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). - Maintenance Dose: Following the loading dose, a daily maintenance dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel should be continued for the prescribed duration, typically up to 12 months or as determined by the treating physician. 1. **Prasugrel** : - Loading Dose: A loading dose of 60 mg of prasugrel should be given at the time of PCI. - Maintenance Dose: A daily maintenance dose of 10 mg of prasugrel is recommended after the loading dose. 1. **Ticagrelor** : - Loading Dose: An loading dose of 180 mg of ticagrelor should be administered as early as possible or at the time of PCI. - Maintenance Dose: Following the loading dose, a twice-daily maintenance dose of 90 mg of ticagrelor should be continued. **Reperfusion** : Reperfusion is the mainstay of treatment in acute MI. In patients with anterior STEMI, timely PCI is recommended. - PCI within 90 minutes of First Medical
