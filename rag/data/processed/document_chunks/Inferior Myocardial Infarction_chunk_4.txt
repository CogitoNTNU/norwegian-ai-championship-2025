an Old Inferior Myocardial Infarction). It is necessary to monitor these patients in a monitored setting, usually an intensive care unit, during the acute part of the event. When potentially lethal arrhythmias occur, early defibrillation is essential. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing an inferior wall myocardial infarction requires an interprofessional team of nurses, physicians, cardiac surgeons, and cardiologists. These patients are prone to life-threatening complications, and hence, prevention is the best approach. At discharge, the nurse should educate the patients about the potential need for pacing in the future. The dietitian should recommend a low-salt, low-fat diet. The patient should be enrolled in a cardiac rehab program. The pharmacist should encourage smoking cessation, medication compliance, and the reduction of blood cholesterol and glucose.[11][12][13] **Outcomes** When the RV is involved in an inferior wall myocardial infarction, it is an independent predictor of major complications and lengthening hospital stay. In addition, ischemia in the conducting pathways is disrupted, leading to a high degree of atrioventricular blockade that frequently requires pacing. The mortality rate when the RV is involved is often more than 25% compared to patients without RV involvement. In addition, even after discharge, many of these patients need permanent pacing within 3 years.[14][15][16] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23500&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23500) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/inferior-myocardial-infarction-heart-attack/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23500) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23500/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23500) [![ECG With Pardee Waves Indicating AMI](/books/NBK470572/bin/12_lead_generated_inferior_MI.gif)](/books/NBK470572/figure/article-23500.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK470572/figure/article-23500.image.f1/?report=objectonly) ECG With Pardee Waves Indicating AMI.
