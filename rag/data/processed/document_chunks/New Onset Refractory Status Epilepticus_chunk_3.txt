required to understand the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism in patients with NORSE and FIRES. ## History and Physical NORSE and its subtype FIRES can develop in previously healthy adults or children and share some common clinical characteristics. Approximately 60% of patients with NORSE experience a prodromal illness, typically 1 to 14 days before the onset of seizure or SE.[11] Prodromal symptoms may include confusion, fatigue, headache, mild febrile illness, behavioral changes, mild gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, and memory complaints.[11][21][22] Fever is absent in up to 1/3 cases of NORSE, but, by definition, it is universally present in FIRES.[11] There is complete cessation of fever in approximately 50% of patients before the first seizure episode.[14] At the onset, seizures are usually brief and isolated with a propensity to gradually increase in number within a few hours to days and eventually evolve into SE. The number of seizures can be up ≥ 100/day in children. Focal motor seizures are the most common seizure type seen, which may spread and generalize into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Other seizure types may include myoclonic seizures affecting the oro-facial muscles or focal seizures associated with impaired awareness. Seizures can last anywhere from a few days to weeks before progressing to SE.[9][14][23][24][25] Once the seizures evolve into SE, they remain refractory to the first and second-line treatment options, requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further aggressive treatment options. Patients with unknown etiology or “cryptogenic NORSE” have been observed to have similar clinical features and disease course compared to patients with NORSE caused by autoimmune encephalitis but with a longer duration and severity of seizures associated with respiratory involvement requiring mechanical ventilation and worse outcomes.[11][22] ## Evaluation Patients who present with SE should undergo an initial laboratory workup, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Urine and blood toxicology screen (alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, heavy metals, synthetic cannabinoids, ecstasy, and bath salts) should be sent on admission.[26] For patients who progress to RSE and the initial workup fails to elucidate an etiology, additional laboratory investigations should then be considered to focus on autoimmune and uncommon infectious etiologies. **Laboratory** A lumbar puncture should be performed if no clear etiology can be found on initial testing. Routine CSF studies, including cell count, protein, glucose, lactate, markers of inflammation (oligoclonal bands and IgG index),
