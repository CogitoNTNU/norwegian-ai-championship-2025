intervals are compared between the 2 pacing sites (see **Image.** Differential Ventricular Pacing Responses). In cases where a septal accessory pathway is absent and ventricular activation conduction occurs exclusively through the AV node, pacing from the RV apex results in a shorter Stim-A or V-A interval than pacing from the RV base. This finding indicates retrograde conduction via the AV node only. Conversely, a shorter Stim-A (V-A) interval during pacing from the RV base compared to the RV apex suggests retrograde conduction through a septal accessory pathway or another extranodal pathway.[8] **Observations and Pacing Maneuvers During SVT** **Observations During SVT** The following observations can be seen during SVT: - Ventricular-to-atrial activation relationship - This refers to the ratio of ventricular to atrial activation electrograms during the tachycardia. The presence of A-V dissociation during the tachycardia excludes AVRT, which involves A-V bypass tracts. - Ventricular beats exceeding atrial beats - This finding excludes both atrial tachycardia and AVRT. In atrial tachycardia, the atria initiate and maintain the tachycardia, so the number of atrial activations should be equal to or greater than the ventricular activations. In AVRT, atrial and ventricular activations occur in a 1:1 ratio due to the reentrant circuit involving the AV node and 1 or more accessory pathways. - Atrial beats exceeding ventricular beats - When atrial beats outnumber ventricular beats, AVRT can be excluded. In AVRT, each atrial beat is usually followed by a ventricular beat. A higher number of atrial beats suggests an alternate mechanism, such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. - Ventricular activation interval (septal time) - This interval measures the time between ventricular activation and the subsequent atrial activation at the septum. A septal V-A interval shorter than 70 milliseconds suggests that the SVT is unlikely to be caused by AVRT involving typical bypass tracts, which generally produce longer V-A intervals. In these cases, AVNRT is more likely to occur. - Atrial activation sequence - This refers to the pattern of atrial activation during tachycardia. A concentric pattern begins at the AV node and spreads outward. In contrast, an eccentric pattern—where the earliest activation occurs away from the septum—suggests the presence of a concealed accessory pathway. **Observations During Transitions** The following observations can be seen during transitions: - Initiation - How SVT begins can offer insights into its underlying mechanism. An A-H jump—a sudden increase in the interval from atrial to His bundle activation—indicates
