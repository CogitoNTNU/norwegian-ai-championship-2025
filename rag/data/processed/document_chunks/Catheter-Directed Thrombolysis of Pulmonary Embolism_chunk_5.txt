concurrently with implementing treatment recommendations. - The PERT structure varies by institution but may involve specialties such as critical care, pulmonology, cardiology, interventional radiology, and more. - Each member plays a specific role in patient care, from diagnosis and risk stratification to procedures and medication management. The PERT algorithm provides a general framework and may require adaptation based on specific institutional protocols and patient needs.[24] The following steps encompass the PERT approach to the management of pulmonary embolism: 1. **Patient identification:** Identify patients with suspected or confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, especially submassive or massive cases. Consider low-risk pulmonary embolism with significant contraindications to anticoagulation. 1. **PERT activation:** Trigger activation based on predefined criteria (eg, pulmonary embolism severity and comorbidities). Ensure a precise mechanism for team notification and assembly. 1. **Initial assessment:** The emergency medicine or admitting team performs initial patient evaluation and diagnosis. They gather relevant data such as clinical presentation, risk factors, vital signs, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. 1. **Multidisciplinary consultation:** PERT convenes to discuss the case and treatment options. Consider the potential roles of each specialty: - Critical care: Hemodynamic management, respiratory support - Pulmonology: Diagnosis, risk stratification, follow-up - Cardiology: Medical management, thrombolysis consideration - Radiology: Advanced imaging, procedures (eg, catheter embolectomy) - Vascular surgery: Surgical thrombectomy if needed - Hematology: Anticoagulation selection, thrombophilia evaluation - Pharmacy: Medication dosing and monitoring 1. **Treatment decision:** PERT collaboratively determines the most appropriate treatment approach based on patient factors and available resources. Options may include: - Anticoagulation alone - Thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) - Mechanical thrombectomy (catheter or surgical) - Combination therapies 1. **Ongoing management:** PERT remains involved in monitoring and follow-up care, adjusting treatment as needed. Patients receive necessary interventions such as oxygen and hemodynamic support. Regular reassessment and monitoring for complications are conducted to ensure optimal patient outcomes. PERT is a new team approach to improving coordinated care in acute pulmonary embolism. It brings together specialists for rapid consultations and shared decision-making, improving communication and streamlining treatment. Studies indicate the feasibility of creating PERT teams, and the PERT consortium, a collaborative effort, is gathering data to assess its impact.[24][25][24] This data provides valuable insights into PERT's effectiveness in enhancing patient outcomes, care practices, cost-efficiency, and overall pulmonary embolism treatment knowledge. ## Preparation Before initiating the procedure, the practitioner should inspect the thrombolysis catheter delivery system to ensure all components are present. This procedure necessitates a fully operating
