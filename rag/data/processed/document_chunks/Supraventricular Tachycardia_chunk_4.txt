occurs away from the septum—suggests the presence of a concealed accessory pathway. **Observations During Transitions** The following observations can be seen during transitions: - Initiation - How SVT begins can offer insights into its underlying mechanism. An A-H jump—a sudden increase in the interval from atrial to His bundle activation—indicates AV node involvement. This makes atrial tachycardia less likely, as it originates in the atria and does not depend on the AV node for its initiation. - Bundle branch block (BBB) - The presence of the BBB during tachycardia extends the ventricular activation interval in AVRT. Specifically, a prolongation of the ventricular activation interval of more than 35 milliseconds occurring alongside the appearance of BBB indicates orthodromic AVRT, especially when a free wall accessory pathway is ipsilateral to the BBB. - Termination - If the SVT terminates with an atrial event, it suggests atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia originates in the atria and is characterized by atrial impulses driving the tachycardia. Consequently, when atrial tachycardia terminates, it usually does so with an atrial event. - Conversely, AVNRT and AVRT may terminate with either an atrial or a ventricular event, depending on where the reentrant circuit is interrupted. If the circuit is interrupted on the ventricular side (for example, due to a change in ventricular conduction), the tachycardia may cease with a ventricular event. Alternatively, if the circuit is interrupted at the atrial level, termination may occur with an atrial event. The key distinction is that these forms of SVT are not solely dependent on atrial activity, allowing for termination through either atrial or ventricular event. - The term "wobble" in the context of tachycardia refers to spontaneous variations in the tachycardia cycle length (TCL). These fluctuations often result from variations in conduction velocity along different pathways that participate in the tachycardia circuit. In AVNRT, a wobble in the R-R interval suggests the presence of a "slow pathway" within the AV node. This finding also helps exclude atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia typically causes variations in the A-A interval rather than the R-R interval.[9] **Pacing Maneuvers During SVT** Ventricular overdrive pacing (VOP) is a crucial technique for differentiating various types of SVT. To ensure accurate interpretation, specific conditions must be met during the maneuver, including: - Ventricular pacing is performed at a rate 10 to 30 milliseconds faster than the TCL, and it must be confirmed that the atrial rate advances
