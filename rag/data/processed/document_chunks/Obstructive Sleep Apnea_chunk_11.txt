accidents ## Deterrence and Patient Education Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with OSA. They should be advised to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and certain antidepressants, as these substances can worsen their condition. Patients should also be educated on the importance of proper sleep hygiene, ensuring sufficient sleep each night, and the risks of driving while drowsy. Adherence to CPAP use should be strongly encouraged, along with proper cleaning and maintenance of the machine to ensure optimal function. ## Pearls and Other Issues An association exists between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and OSA, although a definitive causal relationship has not been established. Up to 47% of patients with PTSD have difficulty maintaining sleep and are known to have a low arousal threshold.[86][87] Patients with both PTSD and OSA experience more severe symptoms of both disorders compared to those with only one condition.[88] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing OSA is most effectively achieved through an interprofessional team that includes a sleep specialist, primary care provider, cardiologist, otolaryngologist, dietitian, pulmonologist, neurologist, and nursing staff. Several treatment options are available for OSA, with the primary treatment being CPAP. Although clinicians oversee overall therapy, nurses and sleep evaluation personnel have a critical role. Nurses are often the first providers to detect therapeutic failure or noncompliance (eg, with CPAP machines) and should prompt clinicians to address the issue and ensure appropriate diagnostic algorithms are followed. An interprofessional care model will lead to the best possible outcomes for OSA patients, particularly given the challenges in managing the condition. Unfortunately, compliance with CPAP remains low. While some patients may benefit from an oral or nasal device, compliance remains challenging. Surgery is considered a last resort and should only be pursued after a thorough evaluation. Surgery does not cure the disorder, is expensive, and may lead to severe complications. The prognosis for most patients with OSA is guarded. Until weight loss is achieved, most therapies exhibit limited efficacy. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26084&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26084) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/obstructive-sleep-apnea-sleep-apnea/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26084) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26084/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26084) [![Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas](/books/NBK459252/bin/Polygraph__Apnea.gif)](/books/NBK459252/figure/article-26084.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK459252/figure/article-26084.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas.
