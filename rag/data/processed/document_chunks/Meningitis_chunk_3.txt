Adults often report symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, stiff neck, and photophobia.[2][7] Unlike bacterial meningitis, the onset may be less acute, and altered mental status is not a common presentation. In contrast, children exhibit less specific symptoms, including fever, concurrent respiratory issues, rash, and irritability.[2][7] Neonates and infants less than 3 months of age may display a bulging anterior fontanelle and irritability as notable signs.[2] Specific factors like premature birth, maternal illness, elevated serum WBC count, low hemoglobin levels (\<10.7 mg/dL), and the onset of symptoms within the first week of life necessitate a prompt and thorough evaluation and management approach in neonates.[2][14] Nuchal rigidity (with a sensitivity of 70%) and fever (sensitivity of 85%) are prevalent physical signs observed in children and adults. Kernig and Brudzinski's signs, while highly specific at 95%, have limited utility due to their low sensitivity of 5%. Depending on the underlying cause, additional associated findings may be present.[2][4] ## Evaluation In recent years, although the cause of aseptic meningitis remains unidentified in up to two-thirds of cases, advances in diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of pathogens. Similarly, substantial progress has been achieved in detecting and diagnosing autoimmune or paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.[2] The initial assessment should involve laboratory testing to explore other potential causes of the symptoms (see **Image.** Laboratory Evaluation for Aseptic Meningitis). This evaluation usually includes a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and testing for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) for enterovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and HSV.[2] A lumbar puncture (LP) is essential for collecting CSF to establish a definitive diagnosis.[2][4][7] During CSF analysis, it is crucial to assess cell count, measure glucose and protein levels, perform a gram stain, conduct cultures, and employ bacterial PCR (typically targeting _Neisseria meningitides_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , and _Haemophilus influenzae_. Specific viral PCR studies should also be selected based on the patient's clinical presentation. Other tests to consider include syphilis serology, tuberculosis (TB) testing, and serum HIV testing. Viral CSF PCR can detect enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, and arbovirus.[2][4][7] Typical CSF findings in patients with aseptic meningitis include an opening pressure that is either normal (\<180 mmH2O) or slightly elevated. Glucose levels are usually normal to mildly decreased, while protein levels are normal
