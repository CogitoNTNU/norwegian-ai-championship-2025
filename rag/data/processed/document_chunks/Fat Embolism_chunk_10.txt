symptoms. Consultation with a hematologist/oncologist and dermatologist can help in the clinical diagnosis. ## Prognosis In patients with traumatic FES, the prognosis depends on early open reduction and internal fixation of the long bone fracture. Most patients with adequate support therapy can recover from the neurological, respiratory, and retinal changes associated with FES. The most recent studies approximate mortality between 7% to 10%. The most common causes of morbidity or mortality include acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, and cerebral edema. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes An interprofessional team is best able to diagnose and manage fat embolism. The diagnosis is not always simple, and there is no specific treatment for the disorder. The key is keeping the patient hydrated and promptly immobilizing or fixing the fractured limb. Many agents have been recommended for treating fat embolism, but none have proven reliable or consistently effective. A meta-analysis of seven randomized control trials using corticosteroid prophylaxis showed a close to 77% reduction in the risk for FES in a patient with a long bone fracture. There is, however, no difference in mortality, infection, or avascular necrosis between the treatment group and the control group. For this reason, the use of corticosteroids is still very controversial. The prognosis of patients with fat embolism depends on early open reduction and internal fixation of the long bone fracture. Most patients with adequate support therapy can recover from the neurological, respiratory, and retinal changes associated with FES. Delays in treatment can lead to ARDs, cerebral edema, and a mortality rate that averages 7%.[9][10] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=21632&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=21632) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/health/fat-embolism/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=21632) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/21632/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=21632) ## References 1.
