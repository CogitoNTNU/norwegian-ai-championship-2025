These enzymes are essential for regulating homeostasis and disease pathogenesis in every organ system based on their activation and involvement in inflammatory mediation. Over 30 isoforms of PLA have been identified to date and differ heavily in function, cofactor requirement, and size. The isoforms fall into six main groups, including cytosolic PLA, Ca-independent PLA, secretory PLA, lysosomal PLA, adipose-specific PLA, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. Within each of these groups, research has identified numerous subtypes. This article will focus on summarizing the critical roles for each of the six studied PLA subtypes.[1] ## Fundamentals PLA plays several important physiologic roles, including the production of inflammatory eicosanoid compounds from arachidonic acid. These compounds are involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, multiple forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other inflammatory diseases. The advent of pharmacological compounds that function as PLA inhibitors serves an exciting role in our future approach to treating various inflammatory conditions.[1][2] ## Molecular Level **Secretory PLA** The molecular structure of secretory PLA consists of six to eight disulfide bonds and uses a histidine/aspartate active site with a calcium cofactor for catalyzation. Activation of secretory PLA becomes increased in response to the aggregation of substrates as opposed to interaction with monomers. This phenomenon is known as interfacial aggregation and consists of an interplay between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to facilitate the binding between secretory PLA and phospholipid membranes. The binding capacity depends on the functional ability of various aromatic amino acids, of which the most notable in function is tryptophan. Within this group, research has identified ten primary subtypes. **Cytosolic PLA** The supergroup of cytosolic PLA consists of 6 members that each contain 749 amino acids and share other structural similarities. The activity of most forms of cytosolic PLA is dependent on intracellular calcium-binding that facilitates the
