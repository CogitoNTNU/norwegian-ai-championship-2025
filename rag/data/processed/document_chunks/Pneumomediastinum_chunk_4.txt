in patients presenting with malignant pneumomediastinum, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or thoracotomy may be necessary.[3] ## Differential Diagnosis The\*\*\*\* clinical features of pneumomediastinum mimic other diseases of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Following differentials should be considered while evaluating a patient with pneumomediastinum. **Cardiac** - Acute coronary syndrome - Pericarditis - Myocarditis - Pneumopericardium **Pulmonary** - Pleuritis - Pulmonary embolism - Pneumothorax - Pneumonia - Traumatic tracheal rupture **Gastrointestinal** - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Pancreatitis - Esophageal rupture **Musculoskeletal** - Costochondritis - Sternal and rib contusions - Rib fractures **Others** - Malignancy - Sickle cell crisis ## Prognosis Although recurrent pneumomediastinum is a risk, it is usually benign and morbidity and mortality are primarily attributable to the precipitating cause. Most cases of pneumomediastinum are self-resolving and require only symptomatic treatment or observation. ## Complications Other air-leak syndromes in particular pneumothorax, extensive subcutaneous emphysema, malignant pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium can complicate pneumomediastinum.[3] Tension pneumomediastinum may occur, leading to compression of great vessels and compromising venous return, which can cause hypotension and hypoxemia secondary to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Other complications may be specific to the cause (i.e., mediastinitis in patients with a perforated esophagus). ## Deterrence and Patient Education Most cases of pneumomediastinum are spontaneous. Therefore, abstinence from smoking or recreational drug use are a few measures that can appreciably lower the risk of developing this condition. Avoid strenuous exercises like weight lifting. Avoid activities like flying, parachuting, scuba diving, playing woodwind instruments. Maintain good asthma control. There is a paucity of literature regarding when those with pneumomediastinum may fly or return to contact sports. However, it is generally advisable that patients refrain from flying or contact sports until asymptomatic.[15] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Most patients with pneumomediastinum have a good prognosis. However, in the rare subset of patients with malignant pneumomediastinum, hemodynamic instability, or secondary pneumomediastinum, the expertise and cooperative efforts of intensivists, surgeons, respiratory therapists, and nurses may be required. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27350&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27350) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/pneumomediastinum-mediastinal-emphysema/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27350) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27350/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27350) ## References 1.
