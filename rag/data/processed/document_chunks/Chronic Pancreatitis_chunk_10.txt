and Patient Education Patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol use should be encouraged to avoid alcohol and quit smoking, as both worsen the progression of the disease. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is essential in advanced chronic pancreatitis with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to improve fat and protein maldigestion. Although no studies have definitively shown its benefit, a diet consisting of small, frequent meals high in protein, moderately low in fat, and adequately hydrating is generally recommended. In addition, most patients with chronic pancreatitis require fat-soluble vitamins and calcium supplementation to prevent nutritional deficiencies. ## Pearls and Other Issues Key facts to keep in mind about chronic pancreatitis include the following: - Alcohol abuse is the most common cause in adults. - Smoking accelerates disease progression. - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption. - Endocrine dysfunction can cause diabetes mellitus (pancreatic diabetes). - Pain is often due to inflammation, fibrosis, and increased ductal pressure. - Clinical presentation includes chronic epigastric abdominal pain, weight loss and malnutrition, steatorrhea, and diabetes mellitus. - CT scan or MRCP are preferred imaging modalities. - A fecal elastase and 72-hour fecal fat tests can also be used. - Pain management is the primary treatment but may require endoscopic or surgical interventions for ductal obstruction, pseudocysts, or intractable pain. - Prognosis is poor with continued alcohol and tobacco use. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Chronic pancreatitis imposes a significant financial burden on the healthcare system, costing billions of dollars annually. Patients with this condition often experience a wide range of complications, including chronic pain, frequent hospital admissions, and progressive pancreatic dysfunction. Given the complexity of the disease, management typically involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. To reduce morbidity and mortality, treatment focuses on behavior modification. Educating patients about the adverse effects of alcohol and tobacco is crucial, as continued alcohol consumption significantly worsens outcomes. Abstaining from alcohol not only improves overall health but can also provide pain relief in the early stages of the disease. Notably, patients who continue to drink alcohol have a mortality rate 3 times higher than those who abstain. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is essential for individuals with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to maintain adequate nutrition. Pharmacists play a key role in selecting the most appropriate enzyme formulations. In addition, patients should be referred to an alcohol and chemical dependency program to support long-term abstinence. Chronic pain management is another critical aspect
