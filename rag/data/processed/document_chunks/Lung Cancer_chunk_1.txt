cause of lung cancer. It is estimated that 90% of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking.[3] The risk is highest in males who smoke. The risk is further compounded with exposure to other carcinogens, such as asbestos. There is no correlation between lung cancer and the number of packs smoked per year due to the complex interplay between smoking and environmental and genetic factors. The risk of lung cancer secondary to passive smoking increases by 20 to 30%.[3] Other factors include radiation for non-lung cancer treatment, especially non-Hodgkins lymphoma and breast cancer.[4] Exposure to metals such as chromium, nickel, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is also associated with lung cancer. Lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis increase the risk of lung cancer independent of smoking.[5] Asbestos and radon are established risk factors for lung cancer as well. Asbestos exposure, particularly occupational exposure, increases the risk for lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner but varies according to the type of asbestos fiber. Nonoccupational asbestos exposure risk is less defined. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards for low-level acceptable nonoccupational asbestos exposure, stating that the health risk to occupants of a building in which asbestos is undisturbed without respirable particles is not significant.[6] Radon exposure in uranium miners was associated with a small but significant risk of lung cancer.[7] Radon has also been shown to accumulate in homes as a decay product of uranium and radium. A meta-analysis of European studies reported appreciable hazards from residential radon, particularly for smokers, and was responsible for approximately 2% of all deaths from lung cancer in Europe.[8] ## Epidemiology Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 12.4% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide, and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths.[9] The American Cancer Society estimates an annual incidence of more than 234,000 new lung cancer cases and over 154,000 lung cancer-associated deaths in the United States.[9] According to the Global Cancer Statistics report from 2020, lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths.[10] Historically, the lung cancer epidemic seems to involve the developed world only. Recent data suggest that the incidence of lung cancer is dramatically rising, with nearly half of new cases, 49.9%, diagnosed in the underdeveloped world.[11] In the United States, mortality is high in men compared to women. Overall, there is no racial
