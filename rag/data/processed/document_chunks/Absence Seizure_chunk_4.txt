and 19 years, with a peak at 15 years.[4] Seizures are less frequent than in CAE but tend to last longer.[3][4] Absence status consists of generalized, nonconvulsive seizures characterized by impairment of awareness and intermittently has other manifestations such as automatisms or subtle myoclonic, tonic, atonic, or autonomic phenomena. Patients usually have a previous diagnosis of generalized epilepsy. Absence status presents as a nonconvulsive seizure lasting between a half hour and several days. It usually ends spontaneously and suddenly but should be treated with antiseizure medications at the time of diagnosis.[16] ## Evaluation EEG is the main diagnostic tool for the evaluation of absence epilepsy. In the case of childhood absence seizures, EEG shows bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3-Hz spike and wave discharges that start and end abruptly (see **Image.** EEG Showing the Characteristic 3-Hz Spike and Wave Discharges Seen in Absence Epilepsy). These discharges sometimes have maximum frontal amplitude or begin with unilateral focal spikes.[2] In 50% of seizures in CAE, the initial discharge seen has a typical spike and wave morphology. The remaining 50% can show a single spike, polyspikes, or an atypical, irregular, generalized spike and wave on a normal background.[1][4] Atypical absence seizures show a more insidious onset and offset, slower spike and wave paroxysms (slower than 3 Hz), and an abnormal interictal background.[4] In JAE, EEG demonstrates paroxysms of generalized 3- to 4-Hertz spike-and-wave or polyspike and wave discharges.[4] Neuropsychological testing has shown that patients with CAE have a higher rate of cognitive deficits, especially involving attention, executive function, and verbal and visuospatial memory. Difficulty with language and reading is also commonly reported. Depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder also have been reported more frequently in patients with CAE.[1] In the case of absence status, EEG shows continuous or nearly continuous generalized spike and wave or polyspike and wave discharges at 2 to 4 Hz. In patients with a new diagnosis of absence seizures, brain imaging is indicated to assess for structural abnormalities. ## Treatment / Management The first-line treatment for absence epilepsy is ethosuximide. A randomized controlled trial in 2010 that included 446 children with CAE showed that ethosuximide and valproic acid were superior to lamotrigine.[17] However, this study had a low seizure-free rate, with 53% of patients in the ethosuximide group, 58% in the valproic acid group, and 29% in patients taking lamotrigine. The group that received valproic acid had significantly lower scores on
