in optimizing lung and heart function, providing specialized imaging, and ensuring the patient's readiness for anesthesia. Pharmacists are crucial for pharmaceutical consultation, addressing postoperative pain management, antiemetics, and blood thinners. This multidisciplinary approach, driven by effective communication and care coordination, is vital for a successful catheter management procedure. Emphasizing this interprofessional collaboration enhances patient safety, improves outcomes, and contributes to overall team performance in the complex landscape of mitral valve regurgitation interventions. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=179&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=179) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/interventional-cardiology/catheter-management-of-mitral-regurgitation-mitral-valve-repair/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=179) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/179/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=179) [![Pelvic Veins](/books/NBK536988/bin/Gray586.gif)](/books/NBK536988/figure/article-179.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK536988/figure/article-179.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Pelvic Veins.
