(90%) of cases are caused by viruses, resulting in inflammation and increased mucus production. Occasionally, secondary pneumonia can develop, typically characterized by worsening symptoms, a productive cough, and fever. In such cases, a CXR is advisable, particularly for adults in an immunocompromised state, older individuals, infants, newborns, and individuals who smoke. Identifying the pathogen responsible for acute bronchitis is helpful, although not always necessary. In recent years, new technological developments have made this possible, such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs that can identify more than one organism at once. Acute bronchitis is usually a self-limiting condition and rarely requires treatment. Acute bronchitis caused by specific types of pathogens can be treated with antiviral therapies in addition to symptomatic and supportive therapies. Ensuring pulmonary emboli are on the list of differentials for patients with cough and shortness of breath is prudent. Aggressive coughing can result in spontaneous pneumothorax or spontaneous pneumomediastinum, underscoring the importance of a CXR when acute symptom deterioration occurs. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes In managing acute bronchitis, an interprofessional healthcare team comprising physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals is critical in delivering patient-centered care, improving outcomes, ensuring patient safety, and optimizing team performance. To achieve these goals, the team must employ various skills and strategies, uphold ethical standards, embrace shared responsibilities, foster open interprofessional communication, and coordinate care effectively. Here are key components for enhancing healthcare team outcomes in acute bronchitis management: - **Skills and Expertise** : Each team member should possess the clinical skills and expertise relevant to their role in acute bronchitis care. Physicians should be proficient in diagnosis and treatment options, nurses should excel in patient monitoring and education, and pharmacists should be well-versed in medication management and potential drug interactions. - **Evidence-Based Practice** : The team should consistently apply evidence-based guidelines and current best practices in diagnosing and managing acute bronchitis. Staying current with the latest research and recommendations is crucial for delivering high-quality care. - **Responsibilities and Roles** : Clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the team are essential. Physicians diagnose and prescribe treatment, nurses provide patient education and monitor progress, pharmacists ensure safe medication use, and other professionals contribute their specialized knowledge. - **Care Coordination** : Coordinating care is central to optimizing patient outcomes. This involves scheduling follow-up appointments, ensuring adherence to treatment plans, and actively involving patients in their care decisions. - **Patient
