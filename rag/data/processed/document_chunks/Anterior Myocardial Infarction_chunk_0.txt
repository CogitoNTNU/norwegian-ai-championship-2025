It is irreversible heart muscle necrosis resulting from decreased blood supply to the heart due to coronary artery occlusion. It is a significant but preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Clinically, myocardial infarction is diagnosed when the rise in cardiac biomarkers is detected along with evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, such as angina, EKG changes, or echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior myocardial infarction carries greater mortality and morbidity when compared with other locations of acute myocardial infarction. However, advancements in diagnosis and treatment options have led to favorable outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of anterior myocardial infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating the condition. **Objectives:** - Recognize the clinical presentation and ECG findings consistent with AWMI, distinguishing it from other types of myocardial infarction. - Implement timely reperfusion therapy, whether primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy, based on patient eligibility and available resources. - Apply evidence-based pharmacotherapy, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and statins, to optimize medical therapy and secondary prevention. - Coordinate the transition of care, including timely referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs, outpatient follow-up, and communication with primary care providers for long-term management and risk factor control.

MI represents a significant but preventable contributor to morbidity and mortality rates. Clinically, the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is established when there is an elevation in cardiac biomarkers, coupled with evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, which can include angina, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior wall myocardial infarction (AWMI) occurs when there is a reduction in blood supply to the anterior wall of the heart, resulting from occlusion
