and Patient Education There is a chance of recurrence of ICH. Hypertension and old age are risk factors. BP should be controlled. Lifestyle modifications should be advised, including avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. Continued multidisciplinary rehabilitation should be done. The following are the possible risk factors for a recurrent ICH: - Lobar location of the initial ICH - Older age - Presence and number of microbleeds on gradient echo MRI - Ongoing anticoagulation - Presence of apolipoprotein E epsilon 2 or epsilon 4 alleles[20] ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Patients with hemorrhagic stroke should be managed in a dedicated stroke unit with emergency and critical care, neurology and neurosurgery, and neuroradiology for the best outcome. The intensivists, physicians, and critical care nurses should be well versed in emergency neurological life support (ENLS). This is especially necessary in low- and middle-income countries. The surgical methods should be done and assessed in a standardized manner. More trials are needed to confirm the role and usefulness of surgical interventions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) also should be given to the survivors. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=90188&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=90188) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/stroke/hemorrhagic-stroke/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=90188) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/90188/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=90188) [![The illustration shows how a hemorrhagic stroke can occur in the brain](/books/NBK559173/bin/Stroke_hemorrhagic.gif)](/books/NBK559173/figure/article-90188.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK559173/figure/article-90188.image.f1/?report=objectonly) The illustration shows how a hemorrhagic stroke can occur in the brain. An aneurysm in a cerebral artery breaks open, which causes bleeding in the brain. The pressure of the blood causes brain tissue death.
