component of working in the emergency department.[16] The development and implementation of troponin testing have had a massive influence on the practice of emergency medicine.[29] It is important to recognize the drawbacks and potential flaws when using troponin testing and to keep the entire clinical picture in mind when making medical decisions.[96] Troponin testing has changed how emergency medicine is practiced, and a deep understanding of its clinical implications is critical to the success of emergency providers.[28] Elevated troponin levels should always be evaluated in a clinical context.[97] Causes of troponin elevation other than MI include the following: myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiac contusion or trauma, aortic dissection, endocarditis, cardiac surgery, pulmonary embolism, stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, chronic severe heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias (tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, heart blocks), sepsis, renal failure, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), takotsubo cardiomyopathy, burns, extreme exertion, post–cardiac surgery, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, medications (doxorubicin, trastuzumab), snake venom, transplant vasculopathy, and critical illness.[98] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours.[99] Laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.[100] To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturers’ recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency (such as once per month), the labs can develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP) that involves performing a risk assessment of potential sources of error in all phases of testing and putting in place a QC plan to reduce the likelihood of errors.[101] Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of any rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing.[102] The laboratory must participate in the external quality control or proficiency testing (PT) program because it is a regulatory requirement published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.[103] It is helpful to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the laboratory with regard to other laboratories performing the same or comparable assays. Required participation and scored results are monitored by CMS and voluntary accreditation organizations.[104] The PT plan should be included as an aspect of the quality assessment (QA) plan and the overall quality program
