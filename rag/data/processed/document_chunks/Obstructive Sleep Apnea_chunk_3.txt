heard through closed doors)? - Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime? - Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep? - Blood pressure: Are you currently being treated for high blood pressure? - BMI: Is your BMI greater than 35 kg/m2? - Age: Are you of age 50 or older? - Neck circumference: Is your neck circumference greater than 40 cm? - Sex: Are you male? The STOP-BANG questionnaire can be used to assess the probability of moderate-to-severe OSA. A high risk is indicated if "YES" is selected for 5 or more items, while a low risk is indicated if "YES" is answered for fewer than 3 items. Obesity is the most common finding in individuals with OSA. Other physical signs include a large neck circumference (17 inches or 43 cm in males and 16 inches or 40.5 cm in females), a crowded oropharynx (a Mallampati score of 3 to 4), retrognathia, micrognathia, tonsillar hypertrophy, low-lying palate, overjet, and a large tongue. However, lateral narrowing is the only independent predictor of OSA after adjusting for body weight and neck size (see **Image.** Clinical Assessment of Sleep Apnea).[34] ## Evaluation Adult patients with unexplained daytime or sleep-related symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep, should be evaluated for sleep apnea. However, universal screening for OSA is not recommended in asymptomatic patients, except for those at risk due to occupational hazards, such as drivers or pilots.[35][36] In addition, due to the high prevalence of OSA and its disease burden, patients with specific comorbidities, including refractory atrial fibrillation, resistant hypertension, and a history of stroke, should also be screened for sleep apnea, regardless of symptoms.[37] Nighttime in-laboratory level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing OSA. During the test, patients are monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography belts around the chest and abdomen to monitor motion, an electrocardiogram (ECG) lead, and electromyogram sensors to detect muscle contractions in the chin, chest, and legs (see **Image.** Polysomnography, 120-Second Window Showing Obstructive Sleep Apnea). Scoring respiratory events in adults relies on 4 primary channels: - Oronasal thermal sensor - Nasal air pressure transducer - Inductance plethysmography (with esophageal manometry or a pressure catheter may be used as alternatives) - Pulse oximetry [38] A snoring monitor is a required
