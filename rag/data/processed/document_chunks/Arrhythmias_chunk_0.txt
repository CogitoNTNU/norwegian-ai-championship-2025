Arrhythmia is broadly categorized into bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmia based on the heart rate. They are further divided according to the origin, means of transmission, and syndromes associated with it. Patients with an arrhythmia may exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical presentation from being entirely asymptomatic to sudden cardiac arrest. Arrhythmias can be paroxysmal, leading to difficulty in estimating true prevalence. This activity outlines the evaluation and the treatment of various arrhythmias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these conditions. **Objectives:** - Describe the broad categories of arrhythmias - Outline the typical presentation of various arrhythmias. - Identify the typical electrocardiographic features and treatment options for arrhythmias. - Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for further electrophysiological testing and management option with defibrillators and pacemakers.

The only normal rhythm of the heart is a normal sinus rhythm. In this rhythm, an impulse is generated in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is conducted through and slowed down while passing through the atrioventricular node (AV). It is then conducted through the bundle of His, to the left and right bundle branches, and eventually into the Purkinje fibers. Any deviation from this conduction pathway results in arrhythmia. Arrhythmias can be classified based on various criteria. The most common way to categorize them is based on the rate of conduction as bradyarrhythmia with a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats per minute (bpm) and tachyarrhythmia with a heart rate higher than 100 bpm. ## Clinical Significance The prevalence of arrhythmias is expected to be 1.5% to 5% in the general population, with atrial fibrillation being the most common.[1] Arrhythmias may or may not produce any symptoms and can be paroxysmal, leading to difficulty in estimating true prevalence. The overall presence of arrhythmia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. **Evaluation of Arrhythmia** In patients suspected of arrhythmias, an electrocardiogram (EKG) is the first
