for prevention of SCD. The overall effect of amiodarone on survival is controversial. Most studies have failed to show any added benefit when compared to placebo or ICD.[12] Sotalol, on the other hand, is associated with an increased risk of mortality by decreasing the defibrillation threshold. A meta-analysis published in 2007 showed a significant reduction in risk of SCD with statin treatment.[13] Lower SCD incidence has been reported in patients on chronic beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. \*\*_Defibrillators_ \*\* Randomized control trials such as MADIT-I (Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial), MADIT-II, SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) have clearly demonstrated mortality benefits with ICD when compared to standard medical therapy. Trials comparing ICD with antiarrhythmic therapy such as AVID (Antiarrhythmic Versus Implantable Defibrillator) have shown similar results. ICD placement is recommended for primary prevention of SCD in patients at increased risk of life-threatening VF/VT. ICD placement is also indicated for secondary prevention of SCD in patients with prior episodes of VF and sustained VT. ## Differential Diagnosis It is important to differentiate VF from pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole as both these conditions are managed differently as per ACLS protocol. Other causes of sudden collapse such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism should be considered. The following conditions can be easily confused with VF on an ECG and should be ruled out. - Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia - Torsade de pointes - Ventricular flutter - Pulseless electrical activity - Accelerated idioventricular rhythm - SVT with aberrancy ## Staging **Types of VF on ECG** - _Coarse VF:_ Majority of the waveforms measure 3 mm or greater - _Fine VF:_ Majority of the waveforms measure less than 3 mm ## Prognosis Prognosis of VF depends on the time from onset to early intervention and defibrillation. Shorter delays are associated with survival rates as high as 50%.[14] In patients with ST-elevation MI, early VF (fewer than 24 hours) is associated with increased mortality compared to late VF (longer than 24 hours).[15] VF outside the hospital can be reversed as today there are defibrillators available in many places. But the success of reversal declines at a rate of 5-10% for every minute that is delayed. Even under ideal circumstances, 30-40% of patients survive but many also develop residual neurological deficits because of anoxia. Full recovery is rare. ## Complications - Anoxic brain injury - Post defibrillation arrhythmias - Injuries from
