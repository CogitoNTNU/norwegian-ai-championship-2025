treatment, with monthly monitoring recommended for the first 3 to 6 months. Nintedanib has the potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly with medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.[59] The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with nintedanib include diarrhea and weight loss, while those for pirfenidone are rash, photosensitivity, and gastrointestinal discomfort.[43] Gastrointestinal adverse effects are the primary reason for discontinuing both medications.[60] Limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of medications such as sildenafil in reducing mortality and decreasing acute exacerbations.[61] **Lung transplant** Referral for a lung transplant is recommended early in the course of the disease, particularly for patients experiencing a progressive decline in lung function. Studies have demonstrated survival benefits for patients with IPF who undergo a lung transplant.[62] **Additional Treatments** Acute exacerbations can occur in IPF, leading to a rapid decline in lung function. When suspected, it is crucial to exclude factors like heart failure and consider and promptly treat potential infections and thromboembolic disease. Imaging during acute exacerbations may reveal ground-glass opacities and consolidations.[63] IPF primarily affects the lungs, with no observed involvement of other organs. The disease progression varies among patients, with some remaining stable for years after diagnosis, others experiencing rapid decline, and some having periodic exacerbations that contribute to declining lung function and increased mortality. Baseline lung function at diagnosis, the presence of comorbidities (especially coexisting emphysema and pulmonary hypertension), smoking history, low body mass index, and older age are associated with a worse prognosis in IPF. Monitoring the disease progression typically involves regular evaluations, usually every 3 to 6 months or more frequently as needed, to assess for worsening symptoms such as dyspnea and oxygenation. This monitoring process includes assessing symptoms such as dyspnea and oxygenation, as well as conducting a 6-minute walk test and PFTs to provide more objective data on the disease's progression.[64] Palliative care with a focus on progressive end-stage IPF is highly advised. Studies have demonstrated that palliative care improves symptom management, health-related quality of life, and end-of-life care for individuals with IPF, leading to reduced incidence of critical events, hospitalization, and overall healthcare expenditures.[65] Given the association of mechanical ventilation with poor outcomes, it is essential to address goals of care early in the process.[66] **Investigational treatments:** In recent years, there has been an effort to discover drugs that can prevent or halt the formation of fibrosis and fibroblast. A translational study in mouse models demonstrated that aerosolized
