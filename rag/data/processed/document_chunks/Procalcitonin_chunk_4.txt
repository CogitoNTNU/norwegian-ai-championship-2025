a saline solution, followed by the simultaneous administration of bisphosphonate and calcitonin. Calcitonin is administered through IM or SQ injection at a dosage of 4 units per kg, repeated every 12 hours.[14] Calcitonin's effects become noticeable within approximately 2 hours, and it can reduce serum calcium levels by up to 1 to 2 mg/dL within 4 to 6 hours.[15] If the response is inadequate after 12 hours, the dosage can be increased to 8 units per kg. If the initial response proves inadequate after 48 hours, the administration of calcitonin can be increased to every 6 hours. After 24 to 48 hours, the effects of calcitonin become less effective as osteoclasts partially adapt to its action, reducing the drug's calcium-lowering efficacy.[16][17][18] The countermeasure to counteract this adaptation mechanism involves simultaneously administering a bisphosphonate. As bisphosphonates attain effective concentrations within 48 hours, their efficacy increases while calcitonin's effectiveness declines. Calcitonin can also combine with other calcium-lowering drugs, including loop diuretics, oral phosphate, and corticosteroids. **Off-Label Uses** - Migraine headaches: Research indicated that intranasal or SQ administration of calcitonin may provide relief from migraine pain, potentially by inhibiting the release of neuropeptides involved in migraine pathogenesis. However, the available evidence supporting its efficacy is limited. - Acute bone loss due to sudden immobilization: Calcitonin might aid in averting or mitigating the rapid loss of BMD that occurs when an individual becomes immobilized due to injury, surgery, or illness. ## Mechanism of Action Endogenous calcitonin is synthesized in the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, whereas exogenously administered calcitonin extract originates from the ultimobranchial gland of salmon. Salmon calcitonin is a 32-amino acid, alpha-helical polypeptide that differs significantly from human calcitonin, particularly in amino acids 10 to 27. These variations in the amino acid sequence account for the heightened potency observed in salmon-derived calcitonin.[19][20][21][22] Calcitonin functions through a G proteinâ€“coupled receptor, known as the calcitonin receptor, which predominantly transmits signals via the cAMP and PLC/IP3 pathways.[19][23] Calcitonin exerts its most significant physiological effects on osteoclasts and the tubular epithelium of kidneys, which hold clinical relevance. In the tubules, calcitonin induces diuresis and decreases reabsorption, reducing serum calcium and phosphate levels. In bone, calcitonin prompts osteoclast contraction, thereby diminishing their motility and capacity to resorb bone. Osteoclasts are recognized to undergo retraction and escape the sustained impacts of calcitonin administration within 24 to 48 hours, thereby reducing its long-term potency. Calcitonin also
