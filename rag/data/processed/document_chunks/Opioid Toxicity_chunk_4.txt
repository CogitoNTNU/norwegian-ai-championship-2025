- Morphine 64% - Oxycodone 117% Meanwhile, the use of codeine decreased by 20%. Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has revealed that abuse of all the above opiates increased, with hydromorphone and buprenorphine leading the way with a 438% and 384% increase, respectively. ([SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014.pdf), 2014) Other reports from DAWN reveal that nearly 420,000 documented emergency room visits in 2013 were related to opiates. Cases of abuse and diversion of opiates over the past decade have included drugs like hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. In 2015, United States poison control centers reported a total of 18,425 exposures to pure opiates, which resulted in 68 fatalities and 764 cases of major toxicity. Additionally, 14,632 cases involved exposure to combinations of opiates with alcohol, benzodiazepines, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. The combined exposures resulted in 32 fatalities and 288 cases of severe toxicity. ([AAPCC,](http://www.aapcc.org/press/81/) 2017) The opioid crisis was reported to claim about 128 lives per day in 2018.[13] **Global Consequences of the Opioid Epidemic** The opiate toxicity epidemic is not limited to the United States but is also a worldwide concern. According to the 2014 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, at least 0.4% of the population, or nearly 20 million people, regularly use heroin or opium. The highest usage rates are found in Southwest Asia (1.21%), followed by Southeastern and Eastern Europe (0.83%), and Transcaucasia and Central Asia (0.81%). In Europe, opioid-related deaths have been primarily linked to the illicit use of fentanyl and its analogs. In countries experiencing a heroin shortage, fentanyl and related products have replaced heroin as the illicit drug of choice. In Russia and Ukraine, desomorphine, known as "krokodil" on the street, is inexpensive and easy to produce from codeine. Besides being 10 times more potent than morphine, the unrefined synthesis methods cause skin abscesses, necrosis, and other life- and limb-threatening complications for users.[14] ## Pathophysiology Opioids exert their clinical effects by interacting with the opioid receptor, which has 3 subtypes: μ, κ, and δ. These receptors are all G-protein-linked and are found throughout the human body. Each subtype produces different clinical manifestations when activated.[15] μ-receptors mediate analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and physical dependence. These receptors reduce the medullary response to hypercarbia and decrease the respiratory response to hypoxia, leading to a diminished stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea. μ-receptors are concentrated in the brain, where they
