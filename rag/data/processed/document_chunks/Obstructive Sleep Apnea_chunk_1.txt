include loud and disruptive snoring, witnessed apneas during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness.[2][3][4] OSA significantly affects cardiovascular health, behavioral conditions, quality of life, and driving safety.[5] Other types of sleep-disordered breathing, including central sleep apnea, upper airway resistance, and obesity hypoventilation, will be discussed separately. Please see StatPearls' companion resources, "[Central Sleep Apnea](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/141286)" and "[Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30790)," for more information. ## Etiology Pharyngeal narrowing and closure during sleep is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. Sleep-related reductions in ventilatory drive, neuromuscular factors, and anatomical risk factors all contribute significantly to upper airway obstruction during sleep.[1] Anatomical factors that promote pharyngeal narrowing include a large neck circumference, excess soft tissue, bony structures, or blood vessels.[6] Many of these structures can increase pressure around the upper airway, leading to pharyngeal collapsibility and insufficient space for airflow in part of the upper airway during sleep.[7] In addition, the upper airway muscle tone is crucial; when muscle tone decreases, it leads to a repetitive total or partial airway collapse. OSA in adults is most commonly associated with obesity, male sex, and advancing age.[8] **Anatomical Factors** - Micrognathia and retrognathia - Facial elongation - Mandibular hypoplasia - Adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy - Inferior displacement of the hyoid **Nonanatomical Risk Factors** - Central fat distribution - Obesity - Advanced age - Male gender - Supine sleeping position - Pregnancy [9] **Additional Factors** - Alcohol use - Smoking - Use of sedatives and hypnotics **Associated Medical Disorders** - Endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, acromegaly, and hypothyroidism) [10][11] - Neurological disorders (eg, stroke, spinal cord injury, and myasthenia gravis) [12][13] - Prader-Willi syndrome [14] - Down Syndrome [15] - Congestive heart failure [16] - Atrial fibrillation [17] - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome These associations between OSA and various medical disorders are primarily based on observational studies rather than randomized clinical trials. ## Epidemiology OSA is a common condition with significant adverse consequences.[18] Using the definition of 5 or more events per hour, OSA affects almost 1 billion people globally,[19]\*\*\*\* with 425 million adults aged between 30 to 69 having moderate-to-severe OSA (15 or more events per hour).[20]\*\*\*\* In the United States, it has been reported that 25% to 30% of men and 9% to 17% of women meet the criteria for OSA.[21][22] Prevalence is higher in Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations. Prevalence also increases with age, and when individuals are 50 years or older, and
