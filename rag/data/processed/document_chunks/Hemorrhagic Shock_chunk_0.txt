Classically, there are four categories of shock: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a decreased intravascular volume to the point of cardiovascular compromise. The hypovolemic shock could be due to severe dehydration through a variety of mechanisms or from blood loss. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hemorrhagic shock, a subset of hypovolemic shock, will be explored in this activity. It reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Explain the definition of shock. - Summarize the evaluation of hemorrhagic shock. - Outline management options available for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. - Identify some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and communication to improve patient outcomes in patients with hemorrhagic shock.

The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hemorrhagic shock, a subset of hypovolemic shock, will be explored in this article. ## Etiology Though most commonly thought of in the setting of trauma, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic shock that span many systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources. Obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. The thigh itself can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Localizing and controlling the source of bleeding is of
