monitored for complications which include infection, acute renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. [2][1][27] ## Differential Diagnosis - Deep vein thrombosis - Cellulitis - Gas gangrene - Phlegmasia cerulean dolens - Rhabdomyolysis - Cnidaria envenomation - Peripheral vascular injuries ## Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials There are ongoing clinical trials on the treatment of compartment syndrome with ultrafiltration. The study consists of patients with tibial shaft fractures that need surgical correction and are at risk of developing compartment syndrome. It involves the insertion of ultrafiltration catheters in the tissue of the muscle compartment to monitor the biochemical environment inside the tissues of the compartment. The trial also studies that the repetitive insertion of the catheters is safe and does not increase the intercompartmental pressure. The study is being done by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (NIAMS). Previous studies on ultrafiltration as a treatment modality for compartment syndrome have been done but further research on this approach is warranted.[28] ## Prognosis The prognosis after treatment of compartment syndrome depends mainly on how quickly the condition is diagnosed and treated. When fasciotomy is done within 6 hours, there is almost 100% recovery of limb function. After 6 hours, there may be residual nerve damage. Data show that when the fasciotomy is done within 12 hours, only two-thirds of patients have normal limb function. In very delayed cases, the limb may require an amputation. Outcomes for the posterior compartment syndrome of the leg are worse than outcomes for the anterior compartment of the leg since it is difficult to perform inadequate decompression of the posterior compartment. Long-term studies on survivors do reveal residual pain, Volkmann's contracture, mild neurological deficits, and marked cosmetic defects in the affected extremity. Recurrent compartment syndrome has been known to occur in athletes due to scarring. There are some individuals who may die from acute compartment syndrome. Often these cases are caused by infection, which ultimately leads to sepsis and multiorgan failure. [29][5][30][31] ## Complications The following are the complications of compartment syndrome: - Pain - Contractures - Rhabdomyolysis - Nerve damage and associated numbness and/or weakness - Infection - Renal failure - Death [29][5] ## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care - Physical therapy to regain function and strength and prevent contractures and stiffness. - Wound care and monitoring for any ischemia, infection, gangrene. - Antibiotics if infection if warranted - Pain medicine - The patient will
