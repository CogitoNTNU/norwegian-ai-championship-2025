in prevalence emerge. Shiga et al. reported an HFpEF prevalence of 43% in 1245 patients with heart failure hospitalized in Japan between 2013 and 2014.[28] Wang et al. evaluated 5236 patients in a community-based heart failure management program in Australia and reported a 37.4% prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses.[29] In contrast, the prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses in the European Society of Cardiology long-term registry and Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Registry was only 16%.[30] ## Pathophysiology The clinical manifestations of HFpEF are ultimately due to complex pathophysiological processes in cardiomyocyte structure and function, resulting in hemodynamic derangements.[2] However, the pathophysiology of HFpEF is likely not limited to the cardiomyocyte (see **Image.** Pathophysiology of Heart Failure). Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of HFpEF.[31] Obesity is a chronic systemic inflammatory state that induces hemodynamic derangements and hormonal abnormalities that stress the cardiovascular system.[32] Overweight and obese individuals demonstrate subclinical changes in the structure and function of the left ventricle, even in the presence of a normal ejection fraction.[33] Increased adiposity is associated with worsening left ventricular diastolic function regardless of left ventricular mass.[34] Central obesity is associated with age-related increases in ventricular end-systolic elastance in women but not in men; obesity and female sex are significant risk factors for the development of HFpEF.[35] Additionally, right ventricular function is impaired in patients with HFpEF; right ventricular dysfunction is more marked in obese patients with HFpEF than in those with a normal body mass index.[36][37][38] Integral to the pathophysiology of HFpEF is the concept of diminished physiologic reserve.[2] Abnormalities in skeletal muscle and vascular endothelium significantly contribute to decreased reserve. Exercise tolerance and capacity are decreased in patients with HFpEF, as demonstrated by more severe dyspnea and fatigue at matched workloads than controls.[39] This appears particularly true in older patients with HFpEF.[40][41] Additionally, patients with HFpEF demonstrate impaired peripheral oxygen extraction during exercise; the exact etiology of this impairment remains undefined but may represent intrinsic deficiencies in the function of skeletal muscle, vascular endothelium, or mitochondria.[42][43] Patients with HFpEF demonstrate a reduction in total arterial compliance during submaximal and peak exercise.[44] While oxygen transport and utilization are impaired in all patients with HFpEF regardless of the degree of exercise intolerance, exact impairments vary among patients, and underlying comorbidities strongly influence impairment.[45][42] While the cellular mechanisms contributing to HFpEF remain ill-defined, the result of cellular and tissue pathophysiologic processes is
