cancer epidemic seems to involve the developed world only. Recent data suggest that the incidence of lung cancer is dramatically rising, with nearly half of new cases, 49.9%, diagnosed in the underdeveloped world.[11] In the United States, mortality is high in men compared to women. Overall, there is no racial difference in the incidence of lung cancer, but the age-adjusted mortality rate is higher in African American males than their Caucasian counterparts. No such distinction exists between women.[3] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of lung cancer is very complex and incompletely understood. It is hypothesized that repeated exposure to carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke leads to dysplasia of lung epithelium. If the exposure continues, it leads to genetic mutations and affects protein synthesis.[12] This, in turn, disrupts the cell cycle and promotes carcinogenesis. The most common genetic mutations responsible for lung cancer development are _MYC_ , _BCL2_ , and _p53_ for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and _EGFR_ , _KRAS_ ,\_\_ and _p16_ for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[13][14] Histopathological classification of lung cancers is based on cellular and molecular subtypes, which is an essential part of diagnosing and managing lung cancers. The 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system of lung tumors divides the lung cancers as follows: - Precursor glandular lesions - Adenocarcinomas - Adenosquamous carcinomas - Squamous precursor lesions - Squamous cell carcinomas - Large cell carcinomas - Sarcomatoid carcinomas - Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms - Salivary gland-type tumors - Neuroendocrine tumors - Neuroendocrine carcinomas - And other epithelial tumors According to the WHO, identifying histologic features, measuring the depth of invasion, and mode of spread is of prognostic value. For example, they state that tumor spread through air spaces is associated with a higher recurrence rate after limited resections and should be reported on pathological evaluation. Also, the previously described clear cell, rhabdoid, and signet ring subtypes have been discontinued by the most recent WHO classification as they appear to be cytologic features that can occur in any adenocarcinomas. The WHO classification places significant emphasis on immunohistochemical staining to classify cancers that may not have typical cytologic features on light microscopy. In the 2015 WHO classification system, poorly differentiated carcinomas were reclassified as squamous cell carcinomas if they had p40 expression; as adenocarcinomas with solid subtype if they had thyroid transcription factor 1 expression; and neuroendocrine carcinomas if they had chromogranin and synaptophysin positivity. **Precursor Glandular Lesions** These
