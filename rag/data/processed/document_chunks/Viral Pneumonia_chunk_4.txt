and in the elderly. There is a steep decline in the incidence of viral pneumonia from adolescence through the fifth or sixth decade of life. Then an upsurge as age-related immunosuppression and age-related pathologies result in immunosuppression increase.[7][8][9] **Pregnancy** - Viral pneumonia continues to be quite concerning in pregnancy. Of particular concern is influenza-related pneumonia secondary to the ubiquitous nature of influenza from late fall to late spring; the last two major flu epidemics, 1918 and 1957, produced respective mortality rates of 50% and 10%. This increased mortality is a major factor in the CDC recommendation that all otherwise healthy women receive an inactivated influenza virus vaccine during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An additional, though less common, cause of viral pneumonia in pregnant women is varicella. Limited data reflects a very substantial mortality rate, and current recommendations are for treatment with varicella-zoster immune globulin within 96 hours of exposure to varicella in a non-immune gravid female. **Immune competence** - Decreased immune competence can be a result of the following: - Chemotherapy (and/or) radiation therapy for neoplasm - Treatment of chronic inflammatory illness with immunosuppressive therapy - Organ transplantation requiring immunosuppressive medications - Acquired immune incompetence secondary to HIV - Inherited diseases of diminished immune competency The aforementioned may result in increased susceptibility to viral pneumonia. **Comorbid circumstances** _-_ A number of comorbid circumstances can predispose patients to viral pneumonia including: - Trauma - Severe burns - Uncontrolled diabetes - Malnutrition - Poverty - Environmental exposure - Group living ## Pathophysiology On a macroscopic level, viral pneumonia can occur through one of three mechanisms: 1. Direct inoculation of viral particle into the lung (e.g., RSV or influenza) 1. Spread in a contiguous fashion from viral infections near the upper respiratory tract (e.g., measles) 1. Hematogenous spread from a distant viral infection (e.g., CMV) On a microscopic level, the general pattern of viral pneumonia pathogenesis is as follows. Note that individual viral species causing pneumonia will have some variation from this scheme. - The target cell is the pneumocyte with resultant alveolar damage. - The submucosa of the alveoli is targeted, causing inflammation and secondary edema, microhemorrhage, and cellular immune reaction. - The cellular reaction consists of mononuclear lymphocytes and progresses to PMNs recruitment. - Fibrin is released. - Both CD4 and CD8 cells are involved, beginning a cascade of immune product secretion that can end in increased vascular
