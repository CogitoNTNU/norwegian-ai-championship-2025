Common pathogens responsible for bacterial atypical pneumonia include _Mycoplasma_ , _Chlamydia_ , and _Legionella_. The severity of atypical bacterial pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can affect all age groups, accounting for over 2 million cases and over 100,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States, and is a leading cause of mortality in both adults and children. Atypical microorganisms are known to cause a disproportionate disease burden in children and adolescents. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of atypical bacterial pneumonia, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in managing this infection. **Objectives:** - Identify the microorganisms known to cause and be associated with atypical bacterial pneumonia. - Evaluate the clinical presentation of a patient presenting with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia. - Determine the appropriate treatment and management options available for atypical bacterial pneumonia. - Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication in the treatment of patients with atypical bacterial pneumonia.

Viruses, fungi, and bacteria can all cause pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia is caused by bacterial species less frequently associated with pneumonia compared to typical bacterial species, such as Gram-positive _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_. These atypical bacteria are also more difficult to detect using traditional Gram stain and standard culture methods.[1] Examples of atypical bacteria include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Chlamydia_(formerly _Chlamydophila_)_pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species. Similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, the severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.[2] Atypical bacterial pneumonia affects all age groups and can account for
