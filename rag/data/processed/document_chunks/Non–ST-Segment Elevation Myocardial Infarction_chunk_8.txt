the extent of heart muscle damage and ejection fraction. Patients with preserved left ventricular function tend to have good outcomes. Factors that worsen prognosis include: - Diabetes - Advanced age - Delayed reperfusion - Low ejection fraction - Presence of congestive heart failure - Elevations in C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic peptide (_BNP_) levels - Depression ## Complications **Type and Manifestation** \_**I: Ischemic** \_ - Reinfarction - Extension of infarction - Angina \_**II: Arrhythmias** \_ - Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia - Sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block \_**III: Mechanical** \_ - Myocardial dysfunction - Cardiac failure - Cardiogenic shock - Cardiac rupture (Free wall rupture, ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture) \_**IV: Embolic** \_ - Left ventricular mural thrombus, - Peripheral embolus \_**V: Inflammatory** \_ - Pericarditis (infarct associated pericarditis, late pericarditis, or post-cardiac injury pericarditis) - Pericardial effusion ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic heart disease are best done with an interprofessional team. In most hospitals, there are cardiology teams that are dedicated to the management of these patients. For patients who present with chest pain, the key to the management of MI is time to treatment. Thus, healthcare professionals, including nurses who work in the emergency department, must be familiar with the symptoms of MI and the importance of rapid triage. A cardiology consult should be made immediately to ensure that the patient gets treated within the time frame recommendations. Because MI can be associated with several serious complications, these patients are best managed in an ICU setting. There is no cure for ischemic heart disease, and all treatments are symptom-oriented. The key to improving outcomes is to prevent coronary artery disease. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the benefits of a healthy diet, the importance of controlling blood pressure and diabetes, exercising regularly, discontinuing smoking, maintaining healthy body weight, and remaining compliant with medications. The pharmacist should educate the patient on types of medication used to treat ischemic heart disease, their benefits, and potential adverse effects. Only through such a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of myocardial infarction be lowered.
