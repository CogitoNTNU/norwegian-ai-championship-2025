and radiation of the pain - Information regarding the onset, frequency, and duration of the pain - Pain severity - Pain description such as burning, gnawing, or stabbing - Precipitating factors such as eating or moving - Alleviating measures such as eating or assuming a particular position - Associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria, weight loss, anorexia, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or orthopnea - Sexual history, including risk for sexually transmitted infections, last menstrual period, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea - Past medical history, including previous surgeries, alcohol use disorder, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, to assess for the risk of bowel obstruction due to adhesions, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, gastritis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and liver dysfunction - Medication history, including medications that may cause constipation; recent antibiotic use, which may cause _Clostridioides difficile;_ nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications that increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease; and chronic corticosteroids that can cause immunosuppression - Alcohol consumption to assess for possible liver disease - Travel history for patients with a history consistent with colitis or gastroenteritis **Potential Causes of Pain Based on Location** The location of abdominal pain can provide valuable clues for clinicians in identifying the underlying cause. Pain from different parts of the abdomen often corresponds to specific organs or conditions, allowing healthcare providers to narrow down differential diagnoses. - Left upper quadrant pain - Splenomegaly - Splenic infarct - Splenic abscess - Splenic rupture - Epigastric pain - Myocardial infarction - Acute and chronic pancreatitis - Peptic ulcer disease - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Gastritis - Gastroparesis - Right upper quadrant pain\*\*:\*\* - Biliary colic; - Acute cholecystitis; - Acute cholangitis; - Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; - Acute hepatitis; - Perihepatitis; - Liver abscess; - Budd-Chiari syndrome; and - Portal vein thrombosis.[20][6] **Physical Examination** The physical examination must be focused and completed promptly. Clinicians should note abnormal vital signs and the overall discomfort of the patient. A complete abdominal examination, beginning with inspection, is essential. A patient who is completely immobilized and experiences increased pain when bumped or when the bed is moved is a sign of peritonitis. Writhing in pain is often an indication of ischemia or biliary colic. Clinicians should auscultate bowel sounds before palpating the abdomen, as this may reveal absent or hypoactive bowel sounds.[21][22] Tinkling, high-pitched sounds often indicate a bowel obstruction.
