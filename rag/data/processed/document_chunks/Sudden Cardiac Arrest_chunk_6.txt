have underlying coronary artery disease. Alteration of modifiable risk factors and medication adjustment can delay the onset of coronary heart disease, potentially delaying cardiac arrest. Despite the many treatments available for cardiac arrest, the majority of patients have a poor prognosis. However, many lives can still be saved with the basic, the most important interventions, including defibrillation and bystander CPR. Promotion of such education to loved ones and others interested can be lifesaving. All clinicians who see patients should be familiar with the basic principles of resuscitation of a patient that has just arrested. In the hospital, the resuscitation is carried by an interprofessional team that attends all cardiac arrest events. Outside the hospital, the resuscitation may be carried out by the public or a healthcare worker. In each case, there has to be some in charge and running the resuscitation process. In the hospital, nurses are responsible for bringing the equipment to the patient's room and documenting the event. In all cases, everyone has an assigned role so that the resuscitation is undertaken without delay. Unfortunately, despite optimal resuscitation, most patients have a poor outcome or do not make it. Those who survive a near-fatal arrest are monitored in the ICU. In hopes to potentially delay cardiac arrest within the general population, one can undergo risk stratification to identify those who may benefit from certain interventions, including a stress test and screening ECG. Clinicians should educate the patient about the benefits of Daily exercise,[22] a healthy diet, effective treatment of hypercholesterolemia, effective treatment of hypertension, effective treatment of diabetes and smoking cessation[23] Patients with post-myocardial infarction and who have diagnosed congestive heart failure can benefit from medication specific medication adjustment, including the addition of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Select patients can also benefit from ICD implantation. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=18878&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=18878) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/cardiac-arrest-heart-attack/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=18878) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/18878/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=18878) [![4 basic views to use in the patient who presents in cardiac arrest Image, Image 1; Midesophageal Four-Chamber view MEFC, Image 2; Transgastric mid-papillary short axis view TGMPSA, Image 3; Mid Esophageal Long Axis view MELA showing the LV in and outflow tracts, Image 4,4; Midesophageal Bicaval view MEBC Contributed by Dr](/books/NBK534866/bin/IMG_1258.gif)](/books/NBK534866/figure/article-18878.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK534866/figure/article-18878.image.f1/?report=objectonly) 4 basic views to use in the patient who presents in cardiac arrest Image, Image 1; Midesophageal Four-Chamber view (MEFC), Image 2; Transgastric
