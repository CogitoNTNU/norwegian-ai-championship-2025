to rule out lymph node metastasis before attempting curative surgery. Lung resection in itself carries high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it should not be attempted if a cure is not possible. Historically, thoracic lymph nodes were first classified in the 1960s by Naruke. This map was accepted by North America, Europe, and Japan. Later, in the 1980s and early 90s, further refinements were made to improve imaging and invasive testing improvements. Hence, two lymph node maps gained popularity in North America. 1. American thoracic society (ATS-Map) 1. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). This was an adaptation of the Naruke map. In 1996, the differences in the above two were resolved in the Mountain-Dressler modification, MD-ATS Map. It was accepted in North America but only sporadically in Europe. The International Association of Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) attempted to resolve the differences between the MD-ATS and the Naruke maps. The IASLC lymph node map is now the most widely accepted lymph node classification system utilized worldwide. Thoracic lymph nodes can be divided into mediastinal or N2 and hilar or N1 lymph nodes. N2 nodes are more important because they differentiate in cancer stages and, therefore, treatment options. Much care has been taken in defining the N2 nodes in all the lymph node maps. We will attempt to explain the classification under the broad headings of the mediastinal and hilar groups and then further explain the individual mediastinal stations per the IASLC map. **Mediastinal Lymph Nodes** They are subdivided into the following groups or stations:[40] - Supraclavicular nodes, station 1 - Superior mediastinal nodes, station 2 to 4 - Aortic nodes, station 3 - Inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, station 4 **Supraclavicular Nodes (Station 1)** It includes lower cervical, supraclavicular and sternal notch nodes. Lymph nodes are further divided into 1R and 1L, corresponding to the right and left sides of the body, respectively. The distinction between 1R and 1L is an imaginary midline of the trachea that serves as the boundary. Below station 1, the left tracheal border is considered the boundary is differentiating between right and left-sided lymph nodes. **Superior Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (Station 2 to 4)** These lymph nodes occupy the superior mediastinum, hence, named accordingly. They are further subdivided into the following groups: Upperparatracheall (station 2R and 2L) - 2R nodes extend to the left lateral border of the trachea. This extends from the upper border of the
