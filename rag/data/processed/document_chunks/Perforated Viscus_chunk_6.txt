higher with a perforated peptic ulcer compared with a bleeding peptic ulcer.[7] The estimated 30-day mortality rate with perforation is 24%.[6] Patients with comorbidities or those older than 65 have a worse prognosis. Similarly, patients who have a delayed presentation or have a shock on initial presentation also have increased mortality.[6] ## Complications Complications of untreated peptic ulcer perforation are severe and will eventually lead to patient demise. Short-term complications include: - Hypovolemia - Shock - Sepsis - Gastrocolic fistula formation ## Deterrence and Patient Education Patients with peptic ulcer disease should be warned about the possible complication of perforation. They should be counseled on medication compliance to ensure adequate healing of the ulcer occurs. Smoking cessation should be emphasized and other aggravating agents should be avoided as much as possible. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and caffeinated beverages. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Managing a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26938&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26938) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/gut-health/peptic-ulcer-perforated/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26938) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26938/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26938) [![Image ](/books/NBK538326/bin/free__air.gif)](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538326/figure/article-26938.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Pneumoperitoneum Image courtesy S Bhimji MD ## References 1.
