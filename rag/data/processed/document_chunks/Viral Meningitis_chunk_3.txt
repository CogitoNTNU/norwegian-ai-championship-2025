meningitis are listed in the chart: Expected CSF findings in bacterial versus viral versus fungal meningitis. Ideally, the CSF sample should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials. However, when the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is seriously considered, and the patient is severely ill, antibiotics should be initiated before performing the LP. **Computed Tomography (CT) of the Head before Lumbar Puncture** There is controversy regarding the adage that the lumbar puncture is the inciting event causing brain herniation and death in the setting of increased intracranial pressure caused by acute bacterial meningitis. Currently, guidelines recommend empiric antibiotics and supportive care, while forgoing the lumbar puncture if there is clinical suspicion of increased intracranial pressure or impending brain herniation. Signs and symptoms of impending herniation include: - Glasgow coma scale (GCS) less than 11 - Lethargy - Altered mental status - New-onset seizures - Focal neurologic deficit It is important to note that a normal head CT does not preclude increased intracranial pressure or impending brain herniation. If the clinical symptoms are consistent with impending herniation, regardless of whether or not the CT head is normal, avoid the LP and start treatment. Blood work should include blood culture, serum electrolytes as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is not uncommon, serum glucose, renal and liver function, and testing for HIV. ## Treatment / Management Antibiotics and supportive care are critical in all cases of bacterial meningitis.[13][14][15] Managing the airway, maintaining oxygenation, giving sufficient intravenous fluids while providing fever control are parts of the foundation of meningitis management. The type of antibiotic is based on the presumed organism causing the infection. The clinician must take into account patient demographics and past medical history in order to provide the best antimicrobial coverage. **Current Empiric Therapy** Neonates - Up to 1 month old - Ampicillin intravenously (IV) and - Cefotaxime (or equivalent, usually ceftazidime or cefepime) IV or gentamicin IV and - Acyclovir IV More than 1 month old - Ampicillin IV and - Ceftriaxone IV Adults (18 to 49 years old) - Ceftriaxone IV and - Vancomycin IV Adults older than 50 years old and the immunocompromised - Ceftriaxone IV and - Vancomycin IV and - Ampicillin IV Meningitis associated with a foreign body (post-procedure, penetrating trauma) - Cefepime IV or ceftazidime IV or meropenem IV and - Vancomycin IV Meningitis with severe penicillin allergy - Moxifloxacin IV and - Vancomycin IV Fungal
