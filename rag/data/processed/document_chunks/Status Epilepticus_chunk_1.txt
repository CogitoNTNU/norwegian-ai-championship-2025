An early developmental lesion, such as a perinatal infarct involving the thalamus, has been particularly correlated with the development of ESES. In a case-control study, results showed that 14% of the patients with epilepsy and sleep-activated EEG had early developmental lesions involving thalami, such as stroke, periventricular leukomalacia, and cortical malformation. However, only 2% of the patients in the control group had a thalamic lesion (patients with epilepsy but not with sleep-activated EEG).[5] Recently, several genetic etiologies, including monogenic mutations or copy number variants, have been correlated with the development of ESES. Among monogenic mutations, including those in _SCN2A, SLC9A6, DRPLA/ ATN1, n_ euroserpin _/SRPX2, OPA3, KCNQ2, KCNA2, GRIN2A, CNKSR2, SLC6A1,_ and _KCNB1_ , _GRIN2A_ mutations, with possible dysfunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated signaling, have most frequently linked with ESES.[6][7] Recurrent copy number variants were reported in association with ESES, such as Xp22.12 deletion, 16p13 deletion, 15q11.2-13.1 duplication, 3q29 duplication, 11p13 duplication, 10q21.3 deletion, 3q25 deletion, and 8p23.3 deletion.[8][9] The exact reason for the sleep activation of the EEG abnormality is unknown. Some researchers correlated abnormal EEG with the abnormal hyperactivation of the thalamic oscillatory circuit: an interplay between inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABA) reticular thalamic neurons and excitatory glutaminergic dorsal thalamic neurons. Researchers also hypothesized that the change in the thalamic oscillatory circuit might be due to a substitution from GABAa- to GABAb-mediated postsynaptic inhibition.[10] Sleep potentiation of epileptiform discharges may disrupt cortical information processing and trigger learning and memory impairments.[11] ## Epidemiology ESES is a rare condition. Results from a 20-year cohort from a pediatric neurology clinic in Israel revealed an ESES prevalence of 0.2% among 440 patients with epilepsy.[12] Another retrospective review of 1497 EEG records over five years identified 102 patients with an electrographic pattern consistent with ESES. Importantly, children with
