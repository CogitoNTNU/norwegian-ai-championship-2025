IV hydration, nasogastric decompression, and pain control are often required. The use of antibiotics depends on the specific diagnosis. Close monitoring is essential, as patients may develop complications such as atelectasis, ileus, wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pneumonia. ## Consultations When treating a patient with an acute abdomen, timely and appropriate consultations with specialists are critical to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Clinicians should not postpone specialty consultations while awaiting imaging results. Clinicians in the following specialties may be necessary depending on the underlying cause: - Infectious disease - Obstetrics and Gynecology - Urology - Vascular surgery - General surgery - Radiology and interventional radiology - Cardiology - Gastroenterology - Pulmonology - Thoracic surgery ## Deterrence and Patient Education Though most episodes of acute abdominal pain have a benign, self-limited etiology, some have an underlying serious cause. Because the differential diagnoses for abdominal pain are extensive, providing information regarding the symptoms of potentially life-threatening causes will help guide patients on when to seek immediate medical care. Patients should understand that the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain is a sign of a potentially serious underlying condition. Additional symptoms that should raise concern are nausea, vomiting, fever, blood in the stool or vomit,
