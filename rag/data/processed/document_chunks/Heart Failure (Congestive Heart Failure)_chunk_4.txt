a poor prognosis.[7] **Infiltrative cardiomyopathies** Infiltrative cardiomyopathies cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern (similar to the genetically determined restrictive cardiomyopathy variant), which is notable for normal ventricular systolic function but with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling dynamics. This is often associated with a high E/A ratio showing increased early filling and delayed late filling.[6][8] Cardiac amyloidosis results from misfolded protein deposits in the heart; this leads to cardiomyocyte separation, cellular toxicity, and tissue stiffness. Patients are preload dependent and are prone to symptomatic hypotension. Currently, tamifidis is the only medication known to prevent cardiac amyloidosis. It prevents, but does not reverse, amyloid deposition. Its high cost is also a limiting factor.[1][9] Sarcoidosis is an acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by conduction defects and arrhythmias caused by the formation of granulomas. The most common cardiac manifestation is CHF. Due to the associated conduction abnormalities, beta-blockers must be used with caution. Cardiac hemochromatosis is present in 15% to 20% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition initially presents with a restrictive pattern but develops into biventricular systolic dysfunction.[8] Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy physiology can develop hypotension when treated with traditional CHF medications due to preload dependence, so caution should be used to avoid systemic hypoperfusion.[10] **Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy** Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (colloquially broken-heart syndrome) is an underrecognized cause of HF, which causes transient left-ventricular wall abnormalities that are not localized to a specific vascular territory. It has several proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms, including coronary vasospasm, microcirculatory dysfunction, and increased sympathetic nervous system activation. This condition is treated with medications typical for HF with the addition of antithrombotic medications in certain clinical situations with wall motion abnormalities. Recognized cases increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic.[11][12][13] **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of maternal mortality. During pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 20% to 30% due to increased heart rate and stroke volume. It presents with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction during late pregnancy, postpartum, or up to several months after delivery. There is likely an underlying genetic component, and it is more common in women with advanced maternal age, Black race, and multifetal pregnancies. If wall motion abnormalities are present, anticoagulation is essential due to the hypercoagulable state caused by pregnancy. Recovery is variable by global region and inversely correlates with lowered EF.[14] **Obesity** Obesity\*\*\*\* is a leading cause of CHF in patients younger than
