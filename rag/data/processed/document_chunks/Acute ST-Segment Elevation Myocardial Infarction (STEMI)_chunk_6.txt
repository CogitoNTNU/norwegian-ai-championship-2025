centralized adjudication of the final diagnosis for all currently available hs-cTn assays.[26] **Transthoracic Echocardiogram** For patients with suspected ACS where the diagnosis is uncertain, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can help identify signs indicative of ongoing ischemia or previous myocardial infarction. However, the use of TTE should not cause significant delays in transferring the patient to the cardiac catheterization laboratory if an acute coronary artery occlusion is suspected. Additionally, TTE can help identify other potential causes of chest pain, such as acute aortic disease and right ventricular signs associated with pulmonary embolism. **Computed Tomography** Computed tomography (CT) is frequently the preferred diagnostic tool when excluding other potentially life-threatening conditions that may mimic ACS, such as pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. An ECG-gated contrast CT angiogram covering the entire thoracic aorta and proximal head and neck vessels is recommended in these cases. However, CT is generally not indicated for patients suspected of having an ongoing acute coronary occlusion, where immediate invasive coronary angiography is the priority. ## Treatment / Management After diagnosing acute STEMI, intravenous access should be obtained, and cardiac monitoring should be started. Timely treatment is crucial for patients classified under the STEMI pathway. Key factors include the total ischemic time, sources of delays in initial management, and the choice of reperfusion strategy for patients with STEMI. The efficiency and quality of care a system provides for individuals with suspected STEMI are reflected in these treatment times. Patients who are hypoxemic or at risk for hypoxemia benefit from oxygen therapy. However, results from recent studies show possible harmful effects in patients who are normoxic.[27][28] Patients should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of presentation at a PCI-capable hospital or within 120 minutes if transfer to a PCI-capable hospital is required. If PCI is not possible within 120 minutes of first medical contact, fibrinolytic therapy should be initiated within 30 minutes of the patient's arrival at the hospital.[29] Patients should be promptly transferred to a PCI center after starting lytic therapy. If fibrinolysis fails or signs of reocclusion or reinfarction, such as recurring ST-segment elevation, emerge, immediate angiography and rescue PCI is necessary.[30] Further administration of fibrinolytic is not recommended in such cases. Even when fibrinolysis appears successful, as indicated by significant resolution of ST-segment elevation (ie, >50% at 60â€“90 minutes), typical reperfusion arrhythmias, and relief of chest pain, early angiography within 2 to 24 hours is still advised.[31] Conditions that can mimic
