and macrophage function in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and other antibiotic properties. Besides infection, burns can lead to a myriad of different comorbidities as well, which include pneumonia, respiratory failure, cellulitis, urinary tract infection, and sepsis.[3] Since 1965, HBO therapy has been suggested to improve outcomes in thermal burns after it was observed to heal second-degree burns faster in a group of coal miners being treated for carbon monoxide therapy. The skin adjacent to second and third-degree burns is more hypoxic than normal skin, and continued studies have shown that hypoxic tissue surrounding the burn site can be returned to normal oxygen levels with oxygen administration under pressure. It has been shown to decrease edema through vasoconstriction, preserve microcirculation, and enhance oxygen delivery by a direct osmotic effect. HBO also aids in the deactivation of white cell adhesion. Most studies of hyperbaric treatment of burns have been reported using various animal burn models, showing that HBO therapy is beneficial in reducing edema, decreasing fluid requirements, preserving dermal structures with improved vascularity, and increasing immune response. In human studies, the results have varied but support the potential benefit of HBO therapy as an adjunct therapy.[4] A Cochrane review was published in 2004 that looked at 2 small randomized trials. These studies demonstrated improved healing, decreased mortality, reduced hospital stay, and decreased need for surgery.[5] However, some studies have shown little to no benefit with HBO therapy. Insufficient evidence is available to support the routine use of patients with thermal burns, although it is a widely used adjunct therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen does have the potential to decrease healing time and fluid requirements, as well as increase the success of skin grafts, but more studies must be conducted to adopt this into routine practice as this therapy requires complex equipment, procedures, and specialized skills in a constricted environment, which may become unsafe when caring for critically ill burn patients. ## Anatomy and Physiology Thermal burns are classified by the depth of the tissue injury. The American Burn Association has established 4 classifications: **Superficial:** These injuries involve the epidermal layer of the skin. They do not blister but can be painful. They usually self-resolve within 1 week. **Partial Thickness (second-degree):** Involve the epidermal layer and parts of the dermal layer. Superficial partial-thickness blisters are painful but resolve within 21 days and usually do not cause scarring. Deep partial-thickness burns always blister and cause damage to hair
