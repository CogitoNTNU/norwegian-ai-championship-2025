due to elevated IAP. IAH can cause compression of the inferior vena cava, reducing venous blood return to the heart and causing lower extremity edema. Decreased venous return can also lead to reduced cardiac output, resulting in less blood and oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Additionally, the increased IAP causes the diaphragm to move upwards, which raises the intra-thoracic pressures and places direct pressure on the heart, ultimately decreasing ventricular compliance. **Pulmonary System** Elevated intrathoracic pressures limit pulmonary compliance, thus decreasing tidal volume and functional residual capacity and increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Airway pressures increase, and patients can have difficulties ventilating. Alveoli exhibit atelectasis, increasing the dead space. Thus, gas exchange is adversely affected as less oxygen is transported and more carbon dioxide is retained, leading to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. **Renal System** IAH can compromise the renal system by decreasing renal arterial and venous blood flow, affecting the glomerular filtration rate and ultimately causing acute kidney injury and subsequent reduction in urine output. Blood is diverted from the renal cortex, further impairing renal function. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, leading to increased systemic vascular resistance through angiotensin II and increased reabsorption of water and sodium mediated by aldosterone. Studies indicate that oliguria can occur at an IAP of 15 mm Hg and anuria at pressures of 30 mm Hg. **Gastrointestinal System** Decreased abdominal compliance with increased IAP leads to decreased splanchnic blood flow, causing tissue hypoxia, increased capillary permeability, and edema. Further insult propagates the body's inflammatory response, exacerbates intestine malperfusion, and increases the risk of bacterial translocation and infection. The hepatic system is also affected as decreased hepatic flow leads to impaired metabolism and clearance, contributing to metabolic acidosis. **Nervous System** Elevated IAP also decreases venous drainage from the brain, which increases intracranial pressure and decreases cerebral blood flow. Increased PaCO2 also causes increased arterial blood flow to the brain, further increasing intracranial pressure.[10][21][22] ## History and Physical ACS is usually only observed in critically ill patients and is more frequently diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in the emergency department. Of note, physical examination is not a reliable indicator of ACS, even when performed by experienced clinicians, so objective measurements are necessary in any patient with risk factors for IAH.[9][23] If a patient has penetrating abdominal trauma, has received large amounts of fluid resuscitation, or has undergone extensive abdominal surgery, there should be a high clinical
