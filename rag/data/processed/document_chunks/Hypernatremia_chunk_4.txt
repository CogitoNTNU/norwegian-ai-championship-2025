water deficit. - It is important to remember that hypernatremia should be corrected over 48 hours. Rapid correction can lead to cerebral edema and seizures. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Hypernatremia is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist, endocrinologist, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, and the primary care provider. The key is to identify the cause and correct the hypertonicity. The goal of therapy is to correct both the serum sodium and the intravascular volume. In patients with severe dehydration or shock, the initial step is fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids before free water correction. Healthcare providers should be cognizant of the fact that rapid correction of hypernatremia can lead to cerebral edema because water moves from the serum into the brain cells. The goal is to decrease the serum sodium by not more than 10 to 12 meq/L in 24 hours. The acute phase of sodium correction requires monitoring of serum sodium levels every 2 to 4 hours. Frequent communication between the attending physician, the nursing staff, and the pharmacist is crucial to avoid the rapid correction of sodium levels. Rapid correction of sodium levels can lead to a seizure, cerebral edema, or permanent neurological deficit. Special attention should be given to high-risk nursing home patients with neurological or physical impairments who are prone to develop recurrent hypernatremia. Discharge care coordination among discharging physicians, primary care physicians, and nursing home staff can prevent readmission due to hypernatremia. Serum sodium and drug levels should be periodically monitored in patients who are taking medications known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.[17][18] [Level 5] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=23192&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=23192) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/hormones-and-body-chemistry/hypernatremia/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=23192) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/23192/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=23192) ## References 1.
