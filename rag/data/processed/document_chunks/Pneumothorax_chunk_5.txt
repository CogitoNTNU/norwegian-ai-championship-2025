2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. Chest x-rays underestimate the size of pneumothorax and may also reveal other findings, such as hydropneumothorax (air and fluid levels in the pleural space), particularly when obtained in the upright position.[32] In cases where clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative chest x-ray, a CT scan can provide a more accurate assessment of pneumothorax size and detect subtle or loculated air collections that may not be visible on standard radiographs. Bilateral pneumothorax, sometimes called buffalo chest, can be either congenital or iatrogenic. The iatrogenic form typically occurs as a result of thoracic surgical procedures that compromise the anterior connection between the chest cavities. This condition is commonly observed in patients who have undergone lung or heart transplantation, esophagectomy, or lung cryobiopsy.[33][34][35] ## Treatment / Management The management of pneumothorax is guided by its etiology, clinical presentation, and risk stratification.[14][28] The key treatment principles include eliminating air from the pleural space, reducing air leakage, promoting pleural healing, facilitating lung reexpansion, and preventing recurrence.[36] **Asymptomatic Patients** Asymptomatic Patients with an incidentally discovered pneumothorax may not require intervention unless they are at high risk of recurrence. Typically, this decision is not made in the emergency department; instead, these patients should be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and care. **Symptomatic Patients** For symptomatic patients with stable vital signs, initial management may include needle aspiration or small-bore catheter insertion (pigtail catheter) in the emergency department. Evidence suggests that needle aspiration is as safe and effective as tube thoracostomy in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.[37] A recent randomized clinical trial involving unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax revealed that conservative observation was not inferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events compared to invasive techniques.[38] These patients may require hospital admission for observation. Although oxygen therapy with serial chest radiographs is sometimes used, there are limited supporting data.[39] Importantly, positive pressure-generating therapies, such as noninvasive ventilation or high nasal flow nasal cannula, should not be used due to the risk of air leaks and worsening pneumothorax.[40] For secondary secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation or needle aspiration is typically insufficient. These cases require hospital admission and chest tube insertion (ranging from 20 to 28 French), which is typically connected to a water-seal device with or without additional suctioning.[41] **Management of Unstable Patients** Patients with traumatic or tension pneumothorax require emergent thoracostomy or chest
