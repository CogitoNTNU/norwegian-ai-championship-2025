of heparin to cTnI may reduce immunoreactivity, depending on the heparin concentration in sample collection tubes (e.g., heparin at a concentration of 90 U/mL is reported to cause a decrease of approximately 20% in cTnI concentration).[33] The effect of heparin on cTnI immunoassays may be induced by changes within the sample matrix. In contrast, the apparent decrease reported in cTnT values by adding heparin results from the interaction between negatively charged glycosaminoglycan and basic amino acid residues on the cTnT molecule.[34] The type of specimen (serum or plasma) should remain consistent for a given patient.[35] Results may be confounded if there is poor preanalytical handling of troponin specimens, such as incomplete sample mixing at the time of specimen collection, insufficient sample centrifugation and separation of red cells from serum or plasma, presence of fibrin due to incomplete serum separation, and so forth.[36] Currently, the consensus is that the turnaround time for troponin measurement in the setting of chest pain should be 60 minutes, and individual laboratories should strive to achieve this time.[37] ## Diagnostic Tests In the emergency department setting, it is impossible to follow troponin levels completely from rising to peak to fall.[29] When a patient presents complaining of chest pain, a diagnostic decision has to be made promptly. To help guide decision-making in the emergency setting, myocardial infarctions are divided into two categories using ECG findings; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI).[38] In STEMIs, patients will have an elevated troponin and one of the following ECG changes: ST-segment elevations greater than 1 mm in contiguous leads with reciprocal changes, new evidence of a left bundle branch block, or ST-segment elevations noted on a posterior ECG.[39] In this scenario, the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are simple. The patient likely has a major blockage of a coronary vessel and requires emergent coronary catheterization, if available or thrombolytic therapy to open the blocked vessel and reperfuse the cardiac muscle.[40] The non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is an injury to the cardiac muscle that results in an elevated troponin but lacks the ECG changes that define an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.[41] NSTEMIs usually represent less myocardial tissue damage than STEMIs, and an emergent coronary catheterization is not needed initially.[42] NSTEMIs are generally treated with medical management, including dual antiplatelet therapy and full anticoagulation, such as heparin.[43] NSTEMIs present a difficult challenge to the emergency provider.
