beyond it. - Small stable pneumothorax (\<2 cm, minimal symptoms) can be observed with oxygen therapy. - Large or symptomatic pneumothorax (>2 cm) can be treated with needle aspiration or chest tube placement. - Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and should be treated with immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube placement. - Recurrent cases may require pleurodesis or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. - Prevention includes avoiding smoking, high-altitude travel, diving, or unpressurized flights. - Follow-up imaging should be obtained to ensure resolution. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Pneumothorax is a common condition, with over 5 million intensive care unit admissions in the United States annually. Managing this condition requires a coordinated interprofessional team, including emergency department physicians, general surgeons, thoracic surgeons, critical care specialists, radiologists, and specialty-trained emergency or critical care nurses. Nurses play a crucial role in patient monitoring after chest tube placement, ensuring proper wound care, assessing breath sounds, and maintaining the patency of the drainage system. Any abnormalities must be promptly reported to the team. Early recognition of tension pneumothorax by nurses is crucial, as it can rapidly lead to deterioration in a patient's condition. As frontline providers, they must be prepared to notify the clinical team immediately and assist in emergency interventions. Although chest x-ray remains the standard diagnostic tool, advancements in radiology software have improved detection, particularly for less experienced practitioners.[56] Effective management relies on a well-trained, interprofessional team with clear and rapid communication, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=27372&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=27372) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/lung-disease-respiratory-health/acute-pneumothorax-evaluation-and-treatment/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=27372) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/27372/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=27372) [![Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax](/books/NBK538316/bin/apical__ptx.gif)](/books/NBK538316/figure/article-27372.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK538316/figure/article-27372.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax.
