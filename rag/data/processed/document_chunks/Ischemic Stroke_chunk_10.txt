be performed in a specified order, basing each score on the patient's performance during the examination rather than on predicted abilities.

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. ## Evaluation An organized stroke protocol is highly recommended to expedite evaluation.[34] The door-to-needle time of 60 minutes is recommended for acute ischemic stroke patients who qualify for thrombolytics.[34] The goals in the initial phase include the following: - Ensuring medical stability, with particular attention to **airway, breathing, and circulation** - Quickly reversing any conditions that are contributing to the patient's problem - Determining if the patient is a candidate for IV thrombolytic therapy or endovascular thrombectomy - Moving toward uncovering the pathophysiologic basis of the patient's neurologic symptoms The initial evaluation of any patient is airway, breathing, circulation, and vital signs. Patients may present with respiratory abnormalities from elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and are at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. A fingerstick glucose check should be performed, as hypoglycemia can easily be ruled out as a cause of neurological abnormalities. A plain CT head is recommended for patients within 20 minutes of presentation to rule out hemorrhage. In stroke centers or hospitals that can provide emergency care, vascular imaging should be considered for possible endovascular intervention. However, endovascular intervention should not delay the administration of thrombolytics.[34] Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a specialized MRI technique that measures the diffusion of water molecules within tissue. DWI is particularly sensitive for detecting acute ischemic strokes due to its ability to reveal cytotoxic edema—a hallmark of acute infarction—within minutes after stroke onset. DWI can indicate a brain infarction much earlier than other MRI sequences, such as Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). While a DWI scan can show abnormalities within minutes of a stroke, a FLAIR sequence might take approximately 4.5 hours to reveal signs of a brain infarction. If DWI shows signs of a stroke while the FLAIR sequence does not, it suggests that the ischemic stroke occurred \<4.5 hours ago. This timing is crucial because patients with strokes \<4.5 hours old may be eligible for early IV thrombolysis, potentially reversing the neurological deficits.[36] Other diagnostic tests include an electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and coagulation factors. The healthcare provider should evaluate an ECG and troponin because stroke is
