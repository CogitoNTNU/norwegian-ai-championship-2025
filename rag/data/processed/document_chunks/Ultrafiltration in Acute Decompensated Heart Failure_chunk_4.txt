Three recent meta-analyses evaluating the comparative outcomes of UF versus conventional diuretic therapy in reducing volume overload in patients with ADHF found that patients that were able to tolerate UF had a significant reduction in volume overload and weight in comparison to conventional diuretics alone. UF can show great benefits for patients in ADHF refractory to standard therapy with diuretics. It also causes iso-osmotic volume loss without changing or creating any electrolyte abnormalities. In addition, it can lead to maximum sodium loss per unit of volume removal compared to IV diuretics. UF can also lead to change in the neurohormonal milieu, which may have clinical significance in heart disease, and it has also been shown to restore diuretic sensitivity. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The use of UF to manage CHF patients is done with an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, nephrologist, intensivist, hemodialysis nurses, an internist, and a vascular surgeon. Ultrafiltration requires a careful assessment of the patient to determine the goal of fluid removal. Vital signs must be monitored closely and periodically. A team of extensively trained hemodialysis nurses is required. While acutely the treatment can reduce the fluid in the body, the long-term outcomes remain unknown. UF is also an expensive endeavor, and not everyone benefits from it; hence, patient selection is the key.[15] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=39069&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=39069) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/therapeutics/ultrafiltration-in-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-ultrafiltration/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=39069) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/39069/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=39069) ## References 1.
