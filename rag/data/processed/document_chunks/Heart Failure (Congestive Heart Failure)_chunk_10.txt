associated with HF.[38] Patients with hypertensive heart disease may have an S4 or loud A2. Patients with HF with preserved EF may have an S4 gallop related to ventricular noncompliance. **Framingham Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Heart Failure** The commonly used Framingham Diagnostic Criteria for Heart Failure require the presence of 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria to make the diagnosis. This clinical diagnostic tool is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of HF but has a relatively low specificity. The Framingham Diagnostic criteria are as follows:[37] The major criteria of HF include: - Acute pulmonary edema - Cardiomegaly - Hepatojugular reflex - Neck vein distention - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea - Pulmonary rales - Third heart sound (S3 Gallop) The minor criteria of HF include: - Ankle edema - Dyspnea on exertion - Hepatomegaly - Nocturnal cough - Pleural effusion - Tachycardia (heart rate >120 beats per minute) [37] ## Evaluation A comprehensive assessment is required when evaluating a patient with HF. This includes a complete blood count and iron, renal, and liver profiles. Patients require further investigations after the basic metabolic and blood panel, depending on the etiology and clinical stage.[1] **Laboratory Studies** Laboratory investigations recommended in patients with HF include: - **Complete blood count (CBC)** : A CBC may suggest anemia or leukocytosis suggestive of an infection triggering CHF. - **Renal profile** : A complete renal profile is necessary for all patients with HF. It indicates the degree of renal injury associated with HF and guides medication choice. Determining a patient's baseline renal function before initiating medications, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, or diuretics, is essential. Serum sodium level has prognostic value as a predictor of mortality in patients with chronic HF. "The Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure" (OPTIME-CHF) trial demonstrated a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as 30-day mortality in patients with HF who presented with hyponatremia.[39] - **Live enzymes** : An assessment of liver function is usually performed. Hepatic congestion secondary to HF may result in elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).[40] - **Urine studies** : Urine studies can be useful in diagnosis. If amyloidosis is suspected, urine and serum electrophoresis and monoclonal light chain assays should be performed. Bone scintigraphy can be performed if clinical suspicion is high despite negative testing
