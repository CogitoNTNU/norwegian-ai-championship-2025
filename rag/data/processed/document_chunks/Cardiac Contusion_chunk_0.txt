This activity reviews the etiology, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and management of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the classic presentation of a patient with cardiac tamponade. - Explain how to evaluate a patient with cardiac tamponade. - Outline how to treat a patient with cardiac tamponade. - Summarize the importance of a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to caring for patients with cardiac tamponade.

It comprises an outer fibrous pericardium and an inner double-layered serous pericardium. The serous pericardium includes the visceral layer and parietal layers, separated by the pericardial cavity containing 15 to 50 ml of plasma ultra-filtrate in healthy people. The pericardium mechanically protects the heart and reduces friction between the heart.[1][2] Pericardial diseases present as acute or chronic pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Pericarditis is a common disorder caused by inflammation of the pericardium. Acute pericarditis was reported in 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department[1] and 0.1% to 0.2% of hospitalized patients[2] for non-ischemic chest pain. Pericarditis can be divided into non-constructive and constrictive pericarditis. Pericarditis is commonly associated with pericardial effusion that can sometimes worsen to cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a grave condition that happens after sudden and/or excessive accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The state restricts the appropriate filling of the cardiac chambers, disturbing normal hemodynamics and ultimately causing hypotension and cardiac arrest.[3][4] This article reviews the etiology, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and management of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. ## Etiology The cause of pericarditis is mostly idiopathic, which makes up around 90% of cases. Other causes are infections caused by viruses, bacteria, or tuberculosis. Other causes could include neoplasms, a connective tissue disorder, renal failure, post-myocardial infarction (also known as Dressler syndrome), open heart surgery (also known
