syringes. Evacuated lithium heparin sample tubes (vacuum tubes) used for plasma collection are not acceptable for analysis as these evacuated tubes still contain a significant amount of oxygen and will impact the accuracy of the measured whole blood PO2.[13] Syringes containing lyophilized heparin are preferable to those containing liquid heparin, as liquid heparin has atmospheric PO2 and PCO2 values that dilute the sample; when the syringe is not filled, the effect is most significant.[14] An increasing ratio of liquid heparin to blood can have an increasingly marked effect on measured PCO2 and the parameters calculated from it. Variations in syringe manufacturing can create significant differences in pre-analytical effects on the sample.[15] The anaerobic collection technique means no blood exposure to atmospheric air.[16] The PCO2 of air is approximately 0.25 mm Hg, much less than that of blood (40 mm Hg). Thus, the CO2 content and PCO2 of blood exposed to air will decrease, and blood pH, a function of PCO2, will rise. The PO2 of atmospheric air (155 mm Hg) is approximately 60 mm Hg higher than that of arterial blood and approximately 100 mm Hg higher than venous blood. Hence, blood exposed to atmospheric air in a patientâ€™s breathing room absorbs oxygen, while blood with a PO2 exceeding 150 mm Hg, a condition observed in patients undergoing oxygen therapy, releases oxygen.[17] Blood exposure to air can occur simply from the air in the needle and the syringe hub dead space. The error will be minimal if the resulting bubble is ejected immediately after drawing by holding the syringe tip up and ejecting a small drop of blood.[18] The potential effect of small bubbles on blood gas results was demonstrated in one study in which a 100-mL bubble of room air was added to 10, 2-mL blood samples with PO2 values between 25 and 40 mm Hg. PO2 increased an average of 4 mm Hg in these samples in only 2 minutes, whereas PCO2 decreased by 4 mm Hg. Before analysis, mixing the sample by vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms should be done to establish a homogeneous sample.[19] Arterialized capillary blood is sometimes an acceptable alternative to arterial blood when an arterial cannula is unavailable or repeated arterial punctures must be avoided.[20] Automated blood gas analyzers are commonly used to analyze blood gas samples, and results are obtained within 10 to 15 minutes.
