imaging\*\*\*\* has evolved as an essential tool when a discrepancy exists between the clinical stage of the disease and echocardiographic findings. It helps with the precise evaluation of volume, chamber sizes, and ventricular function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also assesses the stage of valvular heart disease in detail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also helps evaluate complex congenital heart diseases. The tool can also be used for noninvasive assessment of conditions, eg, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.[43] **Radionuclide multiple-gated acquisition scan** A radionuclide multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a reliable imaging technique for evaluating EF and is used in patients when a disparity of EF measurements from other studies is noted.[42] **Noninvasive stress imaging** Noninvasive stress imaging includes stress echocardiography, stress cardiac MRI, and SPECT imaging. These studies can be used to assess the benefit of coronary revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. **Genetic testing** Genetic testing is indicated for identifying genetic variants causing cardiomyopathies, eg, Titin, laminin A or C, myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin-T mutations.[44] ## Treatment / Management The goal of therapy for chronic HF is to improve symptoms and quality of life, decrease hospitalizations, and improve cardiac mortality. Pharmacologic treatment aims to control symptoms and to initiate and escalate drugs that reduce mortality and morbidity in HF.[1] Management for the respective stages of HF is outlined by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.[1] **Stage A Heart Failure Management** The recommended treatment for stage A (at-risk for HF) HF include: - In patients with hypertension, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be used for the management of hypertension. - In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors are indicated to reduce HF hospitalizations. - Lifestyle modifications, including healthy eating, physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and avoidance of smoking, are indicated. - Prognostication scores are recommended for patients with HF to estimate the risk of future HF events.[45] Examples include the Framingham Heart Failure Risk Score (1999), Health ABC Heart Failure Score (2008), ARIC Risk Score (2012), and PCP-HF score (2019). - Optimal management of cardiovascular diseases in patients known to have CAD should be implemented. - Patients at risk for HF due to exposure to cardiotoxic medications (eg, chemotherapy) should be managed with an interprofessional approach. - Natriuretic peptide screening and periodic evaluation should be performed. **Stage B Heart Failure Management** Management of Stage B (pre-HF) is
