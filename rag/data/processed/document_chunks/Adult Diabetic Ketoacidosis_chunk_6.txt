chest X-ray may be done to rule out consolidation. MRI, and to some degree, CT imaging of the head can detect cerebral edema, but imaging should not delay treatment if cerebral edema is suspected. ## Treatment / Management Fluid resuscitation and maintenance, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, and supportive care are the mainstays of management in diabetic ketoacidosis. **Hydration** In patients with DKA, the fluid deficit could be up to 10-15% of the body weight.[1] Immediate fluid resuscitation is vital to correct hypovolemia, restore tissue perfusion, and to clear ketones. Hydration improves glycemic control independent of insulin. **Choice of Fluids** Isotonic fluids have been well established for more than 50 years as preferred fluids. Colloids vs. crystalloids were compared for critically ill patients, in a 2013 meta-analysis, and crystalloid was found to be non-inferior.[24] Traditionally, 0.9% normal saline has been used. There has been a concern that normal saline may contribute to hyperchloremia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis; however, this typically occurs when it is used for large volumes. There have been small studies comparing normal saline with other solutions like Ringer lactate. These studies did not show differences in clinical outcomes.[25][26][27] Normal saline continues to be used for initial hydration. **Infusion Rate** _Initial:_ Infusion of 15-20 ml per Kg body weight in the first 1 hour is typically appropriate. Aggressive hydration with 1 liter/hour for 4 hours has been compared in a study to a slower rate of hydration at half the rate. Slower hydration was found to be equally effective.[28] However, in critically ill patients, including those with hypotension, aggressive fluid therapy is preferred. There has been extensive debate regarding the risk of cerebral edema in patients with aggressive early volume resuscitation. There are studies that have demonstrated rates of increased cerebral edema with aggressive volume, particularly in the pediatric population. Yet other studies show no difference in outcome and theorize that patients at greatest risk from cerebral edema present at a later stage and are the most severe volume depleted.[29] _Maintainance:_ The subsequent choice for fluid replacement depends on hemodynamics, the state of hydration, serum electrolyte levels, and urinary output.[1] In patients who have high serum sodium level, 0.45% NaCl infused at 4–14 ml/kg/hour or 250–500 mL/hr is appropriate, and for patients with hyponatremia, 0.9% NaCl at a similar rate is preferred.[30] Maintenance fluids may need to be adjusted if hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis becomes a concern, then you can
