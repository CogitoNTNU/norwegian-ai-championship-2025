localize a volvulus and identify any areas of ischemia (see **Image**. Cecal Volvulus). A water-soluble enema may also help delineate and occasionally reduce a volvulus.[19] CT imaging provides a clear view of diverticular obstruction, typically revealing symmetric wall thickening and hyperemia, often accompanied by fat stranding and inflammation. Free fluid, abscesses, and fluid at the root of the mesentery may also be visible. Malignancy may be distinguished from diverticulitis by its shorter segments, asymmetric thickening, and associated lymphadenopathy. A colonic mass or benign lesion may cause an intussusception, appearing on CT as the lead point with mesenteric fat telescoping within a thickened colon, demonstrating a target sign on CT. Inflammatory bowel disease also reveals wall thickening and luminal narrowing within any strictures, whereas mucosal enhancement is present in areas of active inflammation. Fistulae and abscesses may also be present. Malignancy should always be considered in areas of inflammation. A pseudo-obstruction may demonstrate marked cecal distension extending through the transverse colon, with air apparent to the rectum.[19] **Additional Diagnostic Studies** In 2020, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) published updated guidelines outlining alternatives to colonoscopy. These recommendations include using CT colonography to diagnose suspected colon malignancy, particularly when a colonoscopy cannot be performed or following an incomplete colonoscopy. Another recommended alternative to a colonoscopy is a colon capsule endoscopy.[30] ## Treatment / Management **Initial Management** Before any surgical intervention, supportive therapies targeting fluid resuscitation and metabolic dysfunction correction are essential. Patients who have experienced marked cecal distension for several days are at increased risk of perforation and should be considered for some mode of decompression. Serial imaging is critical to monitor the extent of distension over time. Pneumatosis within the cecum or colon often indicates ischemia and possibly imminent perforation. Nasogastric tube insertion can help decompress the stomach in patients with a colonic obstruction and an incompetent ileocecal valve. For patients with perforation, source control is the primary objective. A perforation proximal to the tumor typically leads to widespread fecal contamination and sepsis. In cases of sepsis, damage control measures should be initiated within six hours of resuscitation, if possible, to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mm Hg, and a central venous oxygen saturation of â‰¥70%, which may require pharmacotherapy including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and alkalinizing
