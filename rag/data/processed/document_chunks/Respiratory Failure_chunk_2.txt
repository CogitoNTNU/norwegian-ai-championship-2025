third most common etiology in patients hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure.[6] ## Pathophysiology **T** **ype 1 respiratory failure:** The distinguishing characteristic of Type 1 respiratory failure is a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg with a normal or decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). Depending on the cause of hypoxemia, the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient may be normal or increased. Formulas of the A-a gradient and alveolar gas equation are provided below, as these concepts are helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure. A-a gradient: - A-a gradient = PAO2 - PaO2, where - PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen - PaO2 = Arterial partial pressure of oxygen Alveolar gas equation:[7] - PAO2 = FiO2 (PB - Pwater) - PaCO2/0.8, or PIo2= (PB - 47) × FIo2, - PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen - FiO2 = Fraction of inspired oxygen - PB = Barometric (Atmospheric) pressure - Pwater = Vapor pressure of water at body temperature (37°C)=47 mmHg - PaCO2 = Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with normal A-a gradients include: - **Alveolar hypoventilation:** Alveolar hypoventilation increases the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that an increase in PaCO2 causes a decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2). In this situation, the A-a gradient is normal, as the PAO2 and PaO2 decrease in equal magnitudes. When severe, alveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure.[8] (as discussed later in this section under Type 2 respiratory failure). - **Low atmospheric pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen:** The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) decreases with low atmospheric pressures (Patm) and with low levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In either situation, the A-a gradient remains normal, and the PaCO2 is decreased, given the response to hypoxia is hyperventilation. Clinically, this cause of respiratory failure occurs at high altitudes.[9] Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with increased A-a gradients include: - **Diffusion defect:** Gas exchange between the environment and the body occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. Structural changes to the alveolar component of the alveolar-capillary interface, such as decreased surface area or increased thickness, may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. Additionally, reducing pulmonary capillary transit time through the alveolar-capillary interface may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. In either situation, hypercapnia does not
