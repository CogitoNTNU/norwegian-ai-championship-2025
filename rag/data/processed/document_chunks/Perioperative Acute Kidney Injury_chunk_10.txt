on the clinical picture. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes AKI has significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. All healthcare workers should be educated on the condition, its causes, and potential complications. At the first signs of creatinine elevation, pharmacists should ensure that the patient is not on nephrotoxic medications. The patient should be educated that the regular consumption of NSAIDs is harmful to the kidney and that noncompliance with blood pressure medications can worsen kidney injury. Close follow-up with a nephrologist is highly recommended in all cases of AKI. The patient should have a dietary consult because salt and fluid restriction are vital when managing AKI. Similarly, the patient should avoid a high-potassium diet when there is renal dysfunction. Because AKI induces a catabolic state, the patient should be encouraged to consume adequate protein.[22][23][24] Primary care providers should be regularly updated about hospitalized patients and upon discharge, especially if patients have ongoing serum chemistry abnormalities. Only through an interprofessional approach can the morbidity of AKI be lowered. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=17169&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=17169) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/kidney-health/acute-kidney-injury-kidney-failure/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=17169) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/17169/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=17169) ## References 1.
