GABA-A agonists (eg, benzodiazepines) that preferentially enhance GABA-ergic activity in neurons from the thalamic nucleus reticularis can suppress absence seizures.[4] More recent research on penicillin-induced models of epilepsy in cats favors the cerebellum's role in long-term electrical stimulation in absence epilepsy.[14] ## History and Physical The age of onset of CAE is usually between 4 and 10 years, with a peak between the ages of 5 and 7.[4] The onset of absence epilepsy before age 4 should raise concern for an underlying glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency.[4] About 10% to 15% of patients with CAE have a history of febrile seizures.[14] Regarding the clinical presentation, family members and teachers usually describe brief spells in which the child has a loss of awareness, is unresponsive, and has a behavioral arrest. Bystanders often describe the patient during these spells as having “a blank stare.”[2] Episodes frequently occur, often 10 to 30 times throughout the day. Most children stop their activity completely, but some can continue it more slowly or unusually.[1] Some children have 3-Hz regular eyelid fluttering.[1][2] Clinical presentation can also vary in the same individual.[7] Oral automatisms can also occur, especially with prolonged seizures or during hyperventilation. Children frequently have mild clonic or tonic movements in the first few seconds of the spell. Pallor is commonly reported.[1] Urinary incontinence is rare. Spells usually last between 4 and 30 seconds. Hyperventilation, a state of arousal, sleep deprivation, and medication use can affect the duration of the seizure.[1] These seizures are not preceded by an aura and do not have a postictal state.[13] On physical examination, hyperventilation can trigger absence seizures. To test this, the examiner asks the child to blow repetitively for at least 2 minutes. Using a pinwheel or paper can be helpful because this encourages the child to cooperate more during testing. If hyperventilation is done successfully, the patient may develop seizures that can be seen clinically or on EEG. There is some evidence that absence seizures are more easily provoked when the person is in a sitting position.[15] For JAE, the age of onset is classically between 10 and 19 years, with a peak at 15 years.[4] Seizures are less frequent than in CAE but tend to last longer.[3][4] Absence status consists of generalized, nonconvulsive seizures characterized by impairment of awareness and intermittently has other manifestations such as automatisms or subtle myoclonic, tonic, atonic, or autonomic phenomena.
