In order to avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ovarian torsion and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Describe the etiology of ovarian torsion. - Summarize the evaluation steps for ovarian torsion. - Outline the management options available for ovarian torsion.

The fallopian tube often twists with the ovary and is then referred to as adnexal torsion. The ovary is supported by multiple structures in the pelvis. One ligament it is suspended by is the infundibulopelvic ligament, also called the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which connects the ovary to the pelvic sidewall. This ligament also contains the main ovarian vessels. The ovary is also connected to the uterus by the utero-ovarian ligament.[1] The ovary has dual blood supply from the ovarian arteries and uterine arteries. Twisting of these ligaments can lead to venous congestion, edema, compression of arteries, and, eventually, loss of blood supply to the ovary. This can cause a constellation of symptoms, including severe pain when blood supply is compromised. This is a true surgical emergency that can lead to necrosis, loss of ovary, and infertility if not identified promptly. ## Etiology The main risk factor for ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass that is 5 cm in diameter or larger. The mass increases the chance that the ovary could rotate on the axis of the two ligaments holding it in suspension. This torsion impedes venous outflow and eventually, arterial inflow. In a study of torsions confirmed by surgery, 46% were associated with neoplasm, and 48% were associated with cysts. Of these masses, 89% were benign, and 80% of patients were under age 50.
