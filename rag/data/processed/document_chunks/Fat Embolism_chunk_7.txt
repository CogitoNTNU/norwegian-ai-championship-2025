but this also can be seen in other disease conditions of the lung Blood, urine, and sputum analysis might show the presence of fat globules. Again, this is nonspecific in fat embolism and FES. **Imaging Studies** \*\*_Chest X-ray_ \*\* The chest X-ray reveals the presence of the following: - Diffuse interstitial marking - Pulmonary edema - Lung infiltrate - Flake-like pulmonary marking (snowstorm appearance)31 \*\*_CAT scan of the Chest_ \*\* - Area of increased vascular congestion - Pulmonary edema \*\*_Imaging of the Brain_ \*\* CT scan is not a very sensitive imaging study of the brain in FES. Still, it can be used to exclude other causes of altered mental status, such as epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid bleeding. MRI is the most sensitive test that can be used to demonstrate changes in the brain related to FES. Takahashi et al categorized these changes into the following 4 grades based on the size and distribution of the lesions in T2-weighted imaging: - Grade 0 - normal - Grade 1 - mild - Grade 2 - moderate - Grade 3 - severe Lesions seen in FES are distributed in the following areas of the brain: - Centrum semi vale - Subcortical white matter - Ganglionic regions - Thalamus The authors demonstrated that the resolution of these lesions correlates well with clinical recovery from FES. Some of these lesions develop as a result of vasogenic edema from FFA, which is potentially neurotoxic. Transesophageal echocardiography may be utilized intraoperatively to monitor the release of fat globules or bone marrow materials into the bloodstream during intramedullary nailing and reaming. Fat emboli in the pulmonary artery can increase the pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right ventricular afterload. ## Treatment / Management **Pharmacotherapy** There is no specific treatment for fat embolism or FES. Based on experimental studies, an attempt was made to use dextrose infusion to decrease FFA mobilization. Ethanol also was used as an agent to inhibit lipolysis. In clinical practice, there were no proven benefits.[6][7][8] Experimental use of heparin in an animal model was found to be beneficial but is no longer used in clinical practice because of the potential risk of bleeding. There has not been a proven clinical benefit with heparin in FES. Therapy with corticosteroids has been proposed for the treatment of FES based on the following effects: - Inhibition of complement-activated leucocyte aggregation - Limiting FFA level - Membrane stabilization A
