Infective endocarditis can include acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis, as well as nonbacterial endocarditis caused by viruses, fungi, and other microbiological agents. Since the infecting organism has changed over time, diagnosis can be difficult during the early stages of the disease and is often delayed until a serious infection is already in place. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the etiology of endocarditis. - Describe the pathophysiology of endocarditis. - Outline the treatment and management options available for endocarditis. - Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of endocarditis and improve patient outcomes.

Infective endocarditis can include acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis, as well as nonbacterial endocarditis caused by viruses, fungi, and other microbiologic agents. Since the infecting organism has changed over time, diagnosis sometimes can be difficult during the early stages of the disease and is often delayed until a serious infection is already in place.[1][2][3] In the era of interventional cardiology and radiology, infective endocarditis by Staphylococcus aureus is gaining more relevance. Nearly 30% of patients who develop infective endocarditis are dead within 12 months. Besides the infection damaging the valve, there is also a risk of embolization and stroke. The diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis are not always easy. ## Etiology The leading cause of endocarditis in the pediatric population remains _Staphylococcus aureus_ , followed by Viridans-type streptococci (alpha-hemolytic streptococci)_._ Other organisms are involved but less frequently. Usually, staphylococcal endocarditis is more common in patients with an unremarkable history of heart disease. A recent dental procedure should prompt suspicions of viridans group streptococcal infection. _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ or _Serratia marcescens_ are seen commonly in intravenous drug users. Fungal organisms can
