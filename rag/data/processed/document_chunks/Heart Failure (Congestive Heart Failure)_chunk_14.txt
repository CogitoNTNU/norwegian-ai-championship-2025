patients known to have CAD should be implemented. - Patients at risk for HF due to exposure to cardiotoxic medications (eg, chemotherapy) should be managed with an interprofessional approach. - Natriuretic peptide screening and periodic evaluation should be performed. **Stage B Heart Failure Management** Management of Stage B (pre-HF) is focused on preventing clinical HF and reducing mortality and adverse cardiovascular events, including: - For patients with LVEF ≤40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent clinical HF and for mortality reduction. - For patients with LVEF ≤40% and evidence of prior or recent acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, the use of a statin and beta-blocker is recommended for reduction of mortality, CHF, and adverse cardiovascular events. - For patients with LVEF ≤30% and receiving optimal medical therapy, with NYHA-class I and an expectation of meaningful survival of more than 1 year, a primary prevention ICD is recommended. - Beta-blockers are recommended for patients with LVEF ≤40%, irrespective of the etiology, to prevent symptomatic HF. - For patients with LVEF ≤50%, the use of thiazolidinediones and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers increases the risk of adverse outcomes and HF hospitalizations, so they should be avoided. - Valve repair, replacement, or interventions have associated guidelines for asymptomatic valvular heart disease. - Patients with congenital heart disease also have associated guidelines. **Stage C Heart Failure Management** The recommended treatment for stage C (HF) includes: - Interprofessional management is indicated for improving self-care and mortality of patients with HF. - Patient education and social support are required for optimal management. - Vaccination against respiratory illnesses is effective in reducing mortality. - Screening patients for frailty, depression, low literacy, low social support, and resource and transport logistics during healthcare encounters is reasonable. - A low-sodium diet is recommended. - Exercise training is effective in improving functional class and quality of life. - For patients with congestion, diuretics improve symptoms and reduce HF progression. - A thiazide diuretic (such as metolazone) should be added only to patients who do not respond well to a moderate or high dose of loop diuretics. - For patients with HFrEF, an ARNI is recommended to reduce mortality and morbidity. ARNI should not be given to patients who are intolerant of ACEI, and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be substituted. For patients unable to take an ARNI due to economic factors, an ACEI or ARB is indicated.
