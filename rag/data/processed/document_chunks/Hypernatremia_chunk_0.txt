These mechanisms to protect against developing hypernatremia are impaired in certain vulnerable populations and conditions with vasopressin deficiency or unresponsiveness at the renal tubular level. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of greater than 145 meq/l. This activity reviews the causes and presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management **Objectives:** - Review the causes of hypernatremia. - Describe the evaluation of a patient with hypernatremia. - Summarize the treatment of hypernatremia. - Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypernatremia.

The human body maintains sodium and water homeostasis by concentrating the urine secondary to the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and increased fluid intake by a powerful thirst response. These mechanisms to protect against developing hypernatremia are impaired in certain vulnerable populations, vasopressin deficiency, or unresponsiveness at the renal tubular level. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of greater than 145 meq/L.[1][2][3][4] ## Etiology The basic mechanisms of hypernatremia are water deficit and excess solute. Total body water loss relative to solute loss is the most common reason for developing hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is usually associated with hypovolemia, which can occur in conditions that cause combined water and solute loss, where water loss is greater than sodium loss or free water loss. Combined loss can be seen in extra-renal conditions such as gastroenteritis, vomiting, prolonged nasogastric drainage, burns, and excessive sweating. Excessive sweating can occur due to exercise, fever, or high heat exposure. Renal losses can be seen in intrinsic renal disease, post-obstructive diuresis, and with the use of osmotic or loop diuretics. Hyperglycemia and mannitol are common causes of osmotic diuresis. Free
