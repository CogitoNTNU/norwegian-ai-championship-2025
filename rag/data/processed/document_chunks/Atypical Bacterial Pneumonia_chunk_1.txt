, and _Legionella_ species. Similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, the severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.[2] Atypical bacterial pneumonia affects all age groups and can account for up to 40% of community-acquired pneumonia cases.[3] _M. pneumoniae_ alone is estimated to account for over 2 million cases and 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States.[4][5] Atypical bacterial pneumonia can cause mortality in both adults and children, and epidemics may occur every few years.[6] Atypical bacteria are known to cause a disproportionate disease burden in children older than 5 and adolescents.[7][8] These bacteria can initially present subacutely and progress to constitutional symptoms.[9] Proper evaluation of suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia, including a detailed history, physical examination, and targeted investigations, is crucial for the interdisciplinary management of this condition.

This process can result from exposure to large volumes of pathogens in inspired air, increasingly virulent pathogen exposure, aspiration, or impaired host defenses. Given the various environments in which pneumonia can be acquired, the diagnosis is often broadly classified into community-acquired or hospital-acquired.[1] Pneumonia may also be further classified as viral, bacterial, or atypical bacterial based on the pathogen identified for treatment. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can arise from various sources. The most commonly identified pathogens include: - _M. pneumoniae_ , often associated with close living conditions such as schools and military barracks - _Legionella_ _pneumophila_ from stagnant water sources - _L. longbeachae_ from potting mixes - _C. pneumoniae_[1][10][11] Other atypical bacterial species may be associated with pneumonia depending on the geographical risk region. These species include: - _Coxiella burnetii_ and _Francisella tularensis_ from various mammalian sources - _C. psittaci_ from avian sources [12][13][14] ## Epidemiology An estimated 7% to 20% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are caused by atypical bacterial microorganisms.[5] Due to their intracellular nature, these pathogens are not visible on Gram stain and are difficult to culture; therefore, the actual number of bacterial pneumonia cases attributable to atypical microorganisms is unknown, but given similar treatments, specific etiology is often unnecessary.[15] Age is often the only reliable predictor in adults, though particular risk factors may exist for atypical bacterial pneumonia
