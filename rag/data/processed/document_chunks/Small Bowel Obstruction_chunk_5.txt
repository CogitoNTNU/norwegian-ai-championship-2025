of this condition. ## Pathophysiology SBO results from an interruption in the normal flow of intestinal contents due to a mechanical blockage or functional impairment. This disruption triggers a series of pathological processes affecting the bowel wall, vascular supply, and systemic physiology. These processes can escalate rapidly, especially in cases of strangulation or ischemia, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and intervention. **Mechanical Obstruction** In mechanical SBO, a physical barrier obstructs the bowel lumen, creating a transition point where proximal bowel distention and distal bowel decompression occur. The obstructing lesion prevents the passage of intestinal contents, leading to increased intraluminal pressure proximal to the obstruction. This pressure gradient causes: - Proximal bowel distention - This may induce vomiting as the bowel attempts to relieve pressure. - Distal bowel decompression - This occurs along with inhibition of peristalsis distal to the obstruction, while proximal peristalsis temporarily increases to overcome the blockage. Common causes of mechanical obstruction include adhesions, hernias, tumors, strictures, and volvulus. **Physiological Consequences** - Impaired venous flow and bowel wall edema - As the proximal bowel distends, venous outflow from the bowel wall is compromised, resulting in bowel wall edema and inflammation. These changes can exacerbate luminal narrowing and impair the oxygenation of the bowel tissue. - Third spacing and fluid loss - Increased bowel wall permeability leads to fluid and electrolyte sequestration into the bowel lumen and third spacing into the peritoneal cavity as ascitic fluid. This fluid loss, coupled with vomiting and decreased oral intake, contributes to dehydration, hypovolemia, and metabolic disturbances. - Bacterial translocation - The thickened, inflamed, and ischemic bowel wall becomes more permeable, allowing bacteria, predominantly _Escherichia coli_ , to translocate into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity. This can result in peritonitis, bacteremia, and systemic infection. - Ischemia and infarction - Prolonged obstruction increases intraluminal pressure to a point where arterial blood flow is compromised. This results in ischemia, necrosis, and, if untreated, perforation. Perforation leads to peritonitis, which can progress to sepsis and death.[19] - Systemic effects - The combination of fluid loss, bacterial translocation, and ischemia activates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increasing the risk of septic shock and multiorgan failure. **Distinction Based on Obstruction Location** - Proximal SBO - Characterized by significant vomiting, minimal abdominal distension, and rapid onset of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances - Distal SBO - Associated with more pronounced abdominal distension, delayed vomiting, and slower progression of
