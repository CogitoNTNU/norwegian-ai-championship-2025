location and community behaviors. **Traumatic or Physical Causes** Traumatic or physical compression rhabdomyolysis can occur in different settings. Subclinical elevation of creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinemia, and myoglobinuria following physical exertion is common. Some traumatic etiologies include the following: - Polytrauma, motor vehicle accidents, mining accidents, and earthquakes, particularly in patients who are trapped - Prolonged immobilization due to coma, intoxication with alcohol or opioids, hip fracture, and surgeries requiring specific positions for a long duration [13] - Abuse, torture, and the physical restraint of children - Fractures of lower extremities (tibial fracture) causing arterial occlusion from prolonged immobilization, tourniquet, or surgical clamping [14] - Fire accidents and explosions - High voltage electric shock and lightning strikes, which also cause direct injury to the sarcoplasmic membrane, with massive calcium influx, along with severe rhabdomyolysis [15] - Strenuous muscular exercise (especially in untrained individuals), lifting heavy weights, performing under exceedingly hot conditions, status epilepticus, tetanus, and rarely sepsis [16][17] **Nontraumatic or Nonphysical Causes** Nontraumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis can occur from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, electrolyte changes, and metabolic abnormalities. - Medications: rhabdomyolysis is a common adverse effect of many medications, particularly statins. - Infections: viral myositis is most common, and recently, SARS-CoV-2 is commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis.[18] See below for sepsis/bacterial infection. - Electrolyte abnormalities: hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperosmolar conditions, hypo- and hypercalcemia, and severe dehydration.[19] - Endocrine: hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis with coma, myxedema. - Congenital myopathies: most common are myotonic dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy. See below for further details.[20] - Toxins: insect bite, snake venom, hornet sting, carbon monoxide, Haff disease, and mushroom poisoning.[21] - Autoimmune myositis: polymyositis, dermatomyositis. Please see StatPearls' companion references, "[Dermatomyositis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20389)" and "[Polymyositis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27417)." - Dysregulated body temperature: neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, near drowning, hypothermia, and frostbite.[22] Please see StatPearls' companion references, "[Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25799)" and "[Malignant Hyperthermia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24676)." - Supplements: over-the-counter vitamins, performance-enhancing supplements, and weight-loss supplements. - Capillary leak syndrome: caused by muscle edema. [23] - Drugs: Both drug intoxication and drug withdrawal can cause rhabdomyolysis. **Statins** Statins are the most common pharmaceutical to cause rhabdomyolysis. Up to 10% of patients taking statins experience muscle pain.[3] With the increased use of lipid-lowering drugs, the incidence of rhabdomyolysis from HMG Co-A inhibitors is rising. Muscle toxicity from statins ranges from myopathy, myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Proposed mechanisms are CoQ10 depletion-causing myocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of cellular respiration, impaired calcium homeostasis,
