benefits in each case. ## Differential Diagnosis Other potential causes of acute cough should be considered, especially when the cough persists for a duration exceeding 3 weeks. Other conditions to consider are as follows: - Asthma: Acute asthma exacerbation can be frequently misdiagnosed as acute bronchitis, with around one-third of patients presenting with acute cough. - Acute or chronic sinusitis - Bronchiolitis - COPD - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Viral pharyngitis - Heart failure - Pulmonary embolism - Pneumonia ## Prognosis Acute bronchitis typically follows a self-limiting course and frequently improves with symptomatic interventions. However, clinicians should remain aware of potential secondary complications, such as pneumonia. Cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with acute bronchitis have been documented in the literature. Consequently, while acute bronchitis is often manageable with symptomatic care, the healthcare team should be mindful of potential complications and ready to administer appropriate interventions if necessary.[41][42] ## Complications Complications associated with acute bronchitis include: - Secondary pneumonia - Acute respiratory distress syndrome - Prolonged symptoms - Spontaneous pneumothorax - Spontaneous pneumomediastinum ## Deterrence and Patient Education Lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation and minimizing exposure to allergens and pollutants are essential in preventing the recurrence of acute bronchitis and reducing the risk of complications. The flu and pneumonia vaccines are particularly advised in specific groups, including adults 65 and older, children younger than 2 years (but older than 6 months), pregnant women, and individuals residing in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. People with conditions like asthma, COPD, and other individuals who are immunocompromised also risk developing complications. Recurrence occurs in up to one-third of acute bronchitis cases. Additionally, patients should receive education regarding the risks associated with unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, including the development of antibiotic resistance, cost implications, and potential adverse effects. Patients should be encouraged to engage in open and informed discussions with their healthcare practitioners to ensure that treatment decisions align with their clinical needs, promoting effective and responsible healthcare practices. ## Pearls and Other Issues Acute bronchitis is a very common respiratory symptom that affects the bronchial tree. The majority (90%) of cases are caused by viruses, resulting in inflammation and increased mucus production. Occasionally, secondary pneumonia can develop, typically characterized by worsening symptoms, a productive cough, and fever. In such cases, a CXR is advisable, particularly for adults in an immunocompromised state, older individuals, infants, newborns, and individuals who
