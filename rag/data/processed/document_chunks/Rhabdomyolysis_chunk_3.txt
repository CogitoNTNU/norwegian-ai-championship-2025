of patients taking statins experience muscle pain.[3] With the increased use of lipid-lowering drugs, the incidence of rhabdomyolysis from HMG Co-A inhibitors is rising. Muscle toxicity from statins ranges from myopathy, myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Proposed mechanisms are CoQ10 depletion-causing myocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of cellular respiration, impaired calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, and anti-HMG Co-A inhibitors. Statins commonly cause toxic myopathy, associated with no muscle necrosis and CPK less than 1000 U/L, and rarely autoimmune myopathy, associated with CPK greater than 1000 U/L and muscle necrosis.[24] Discontinuation of statins is an effective treatment method for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. However, persistent elevation of CPK after discontinuation of statins should raise concern for necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Concomitant use of other medications like gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and corticosteroids poses an increased risk for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Clinically significant rhabdomyolysis requiring hospital admission was noted in about 0.44 per 10000 patients treated with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin as monotherapy. Even though the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is very low with statin use, in clinical practice, muscle-related side effects are a frequent cause for discontinuation of statin therapy. Use of the lowest tolerable statin dose is recommended in patients with a history of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis.[24][25] **Drug Intoxication** Intoxicants can cause rhabdomyolysis via various mechanisms. Cocaine is a well-known instigator of rhabdomyolysis. The mechanisms involve increased sympathetic stimulation of alpha receptors in the vasculature, increased endothelin production, and decreased nitrous oxide concentrations. Cocaine is also thrombogenic, as it activates platelets and inhibits plasminogen.[26] One study found the highest incidence of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis in those who used heroin intravenously, thought to be from local mechanical trauma from injection, with possible immune mechanisms contributing. Amphetamines also have a high rate of rhabdomyolysis, thought to be due to hyperthermia caused by amphetamine's effects on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Alcohol, opiates, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines may cause mechanical trauma from lying in one position for an extended period while intoxicated.[17] Withdrawal from opioids and baclofen (particularly intrathecal baclofen) has also been associated with rhabdomyolysis.[27][28] Patients with alcohol misuse disorder often have rhabdomyolysis related to direct muscle toxicity of alcohol as well as other insults, such as hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.[29] **Intensive Care Admission** Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also highly correlated with rhabdomyolysis.[2][18] ICU patients are severely ill, on multiple medications, and prone to electrolyte abnormalities; all of these factors predispose to rhabdomyolysis.[30] In addition, patients who are ventilated
