These are classified on the basis of histopathological, radiologic and clinical parameters. This activity describes the evaluation and management of interstitial lung disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition. **Objectives:** - Outline the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease. - Describe the inflammation and fibrosis in the pathophysiology of interstitial lung disease. - Review the physical exam findings associated with interstitial lung disease. - Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by interstitial lung disease.

What makes it difficult to understand this group of diseases is the confusing terminology. The pathogenetic sequence in actuality involves a series of inflammation and fibrosis that extends beyond disrupting the interstitial bed (as the name implies) to changing the parenchyma (alveoli, alveolar ducts, and bronchioles). The list of causes of infiltrative diseases is never-ending. Many are extremely rare. The pattern of disease spread varies among the groups; for that reason establishing the correct diagnosis is vital. ## Etiology The classification system used to describe interstitial lung disease categorizes conditions based on clinical, histopathological or radiologic parameters.[1] Clinical classification groups ILD by its causes to help differentiate exogenous or endogenous factors.[2] Interstitial lung disease diseases without identifiable causes get grouped under idiopathic/primary which uses the histopathological and radiological approach as its infrastructure. Known causes. - Environmental and occupational exposure Long-term exposure to occupational or environmental agents can have a toxic effect on the lungs. Common agents are mineral dust, organic dust, and toxic gases.[3] Many different types of mineral dust have correlations, but the ones frequently cited with the disease are silica, asbestos, coal mine dust, beryllium, and hard metal. Organic dust includes mold spores and aerosolized bird droppings. Inhaled toxic
