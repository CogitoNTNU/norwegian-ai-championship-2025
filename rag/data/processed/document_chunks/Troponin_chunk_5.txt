cTnI in EDTA whole blood or plasma is added to the system sample port via a transfer pipette. Red blood cells are separated from the plasma via a filter in the device, and a fixed plasma volume reacts with fluorescent-conjugated anti-cTnI antibodies.[51] The reaction mixture flows down the device until the fluorescent antigen-antibody complex is captured onto a discrete zone and fluorescence is detected.[52] The generated fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the sample.[53] The principle of the cTnT measurement is an ELISA one-step sandwich assay using streptavidin technology and electrochemiluminescence detection.[54] In the first incubation step (immunological reaction), the cTnT from the sample reacts with a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-cTnT antibody and a monoclonal cTnT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a sandwich complex. After adding streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex is bound to the solid phase via interaction with biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell, where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed, and a voltage is applied to the electrode.[31] A photomultiplier measures the emitted chemiluminescence, and results are determined via a calibration curve generated by a two-point calibration and a master curve (5-point calibration) provided via the reagent barcode.[55] The chemiluminescence is directly proportional to the cTnT concentration in the sample. The method is measured quantitatively using an automated instrument or at the point of care.[56] High-sensitivity testing for cardiac troponins was approved for clinical use in the U.S. in 2017, showing significant benefits for diagnosing and excluding acute myocardial infarction.[57] The new hs-cTn assays have higher analytical sensitivity—less than 10% imprecision at very low troponin concentrations.[4] High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays must meet analytical criteria established by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Biomarkers (C-CB) and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Academy, which focus on imprecision at the 99th percentile upper reference limit and the ability to measure hs-cTn in ≥50% of males and ≥50% of females above the limit of detection (LoD) within a regular healthy cohort.[58] Two challenges limit the ease of switching from one troponin assay to another in clinical practice or research. First, no primary reference cTnI material is currently available for manufacturers to standardize cTnI assays.[59] Second, measured assay concentrations fail to be consistent because cTnI circulates in various forms;
