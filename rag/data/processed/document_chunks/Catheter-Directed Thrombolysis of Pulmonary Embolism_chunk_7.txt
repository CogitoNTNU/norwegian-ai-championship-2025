monitoring as per standard protocols. **The Bashir Endovascular Catheter** The BEC, a 7-F catheter with a unique expandable "basket" featuring 48 orifices, offers a novel pharmaco-mechanical approach for treating acute pulmonary embolism. This design facilitates clot breakdown by establishing a wide passage for blood flow within the blockage, enhancing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents.[21] **Procedural Steps** Like other CDT approaches, venous access is typically obtained via the femoral or internal jugular vein. The BEC is advanced over a guidewire and positioned within the thrombus in the pulmonary artery. The pulse spray system delivers an initial burst of thrombolytics followed by a continuous infusion over several hours, maximizing drug delivery and penetration within the clot. Close hemodynamic and clinical monitoring throughout the procedure ensures patient safety. Upon completion, the BEC is removed at the bedside under careful supervision. ## Complications There are several possible complications from CDT for pulmonary embolism, with most being secondary to the increased risk of bleeding. The risk of major bleeding is significantly lower than with systemic lytic therapy. Systemic lytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism is associated with a major bleeding risk of up to 20%.[27] In contrast, the risk of bleeding in patients undergoing CDT is 1.4% in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism and 6.7% in high-risk pulmonary embolism.[28] One of the most common and most feared complications is a hemorrhagic stroke, potentially leading to a devastating outcome for the patient. Other common complications include vascular access-related injuries such as hematoma, pulmonary hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, cardiogenic shock, perforation or dissection of the pulmonary artery, arrhythmias, right-sided valvular regurgitation, pericardial tamponade, and contrast-induced nephropathy.[29] ## Clinical Significance Systemic thrombolysis remains the standard for high-risk acute pulmonary embolism patients, but its bleeding risk, particularly in older individuals, raises concerns. The optimal strategy remains unclear for those with intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction. Full-dose systemic thrombolysis offers minimal mortality benefits while exposing patients to potential bleeding complications. CDT emerges as a potential game-changer. This precise approach delivers clot-busting medication directly to the blockage, offering the possibility of reduced bleeding by lowering the thrombolytic dose. This makes it particularly attractive for high-risk pulmonary embolism patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis. Early data, though primarily observational, paints a promising picture. CDT reduces right ventricular dysfunction, a key predictor of mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, and shows promise in improving short-term functional limitations and hemodynamic measures.[30] However, definitive recommendations await
