leading to elevated concentrations of NAPQI formation, and the limited glutathione stores can deplete. When there is a shortage of glutathione, NAPQI concentrations increase, and, as a reactive intermediate, it can react with essential cellular macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This interaction can result in centrilobular (zone 3) hepatic injury and hepatocellular death, along with the potential for nephrotoxicity. The only approved antidote for acetaminophen overdose and toxicity is _N_ -acetylcysteine (NAC).[25] NAC acts as a precursor to glutathione synthesis, aiding in restoring intracellular glutathione stores to neutralize the NAPQI compound, directly inactivating NAPQI. NAC can be administered orally or via the IV route. The IV administration of NAC is typically preferred because vomiting is common with acetaminophen overdose. NAC administration follows a 20-hour IV or 72-hour oral protocol, and clinicians must monitor aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels during treatment.[26] Notably, the majority of patients do not exhibit symptoms in the initial hours after ingesting toxic doses of acetaminophen. During this early period, symptoms may be limited to abdominal pain and nausea, persisting for the first 12 to 24 hours. Although these symptoms may alleviate between 24 and 72 hours, AST/ALT concentrations may remain abnormal. Patients presenting more than 24 hours after ingesting toxic doses of acetaminophen may manifest symptoms including nausea, vomiting, jaundice, abdominal pain, and hypotension. The management of these patients may involve interventions such as airway management, IV fluids, vasopressors, and addressing symptoms such as cerebral edema as they arise. A recent consensus statement published by America's Poison Centers, American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, American College of Medical Toxicology, and Canadian Association of Poison Control Centers addresses acetaminophen toxicity. NAC is administered through oral or IV routes, with the initial dose administered promptly upon identifying the need for treatment. The panel recommends a regimen providing a minimum of 300 mg/kg, either orally or IV, within the initial 20 to 24 hours of treatment. Nevertheless, the comparative effectiveness of various regimens still requires evaluation. The guidelines emphasize the importance of continuous assessment and caution against prematurely discontinuing treatment. Notably, a common clinical error involves administering NAC for 20 or 21 hours and then discontinuing without reassessing the patient. The panel chose to refine the Rumack-Matthew nomogram by retaining only the lines indicating clinical action. In this refined approach, the blood concentration of APAP is directly plotted on the nomogram, and NAC is administered to patients
