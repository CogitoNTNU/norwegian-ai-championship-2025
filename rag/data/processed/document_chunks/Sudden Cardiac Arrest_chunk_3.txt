ventilation during active CPR. Current guidelines recommend 2 breaths for every 30 compressions (30:2).[9] Providers can also manipulate the airway to aid in airway patency, thus, allowing for proper ventilation. These maneuvers include the head-tilt, chin-lift[11], and the jaw thrust[12]. Oral airway adjuncts including the oral pharyngeal airway (OPA) and the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) should also be utilized to benefit ventilation. **Advanced Life Support** Providers can use BLS treatment with the addition of medications and advanced airways, including supraglottic airway devices (King LT, Igel) and endotracheal intubation. Medications used in the cardiac arrest include Epinephrine and Amiodarone. Advanced life support (ALS) providers have the additional benefit of cardiac rhythm interpretation, allowing for quicker defibrillation if indicated. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) can teach providers the algorithms used to resuscitate a patient in cardiac arrest. **Physician** Providers can use ALS treatment and progress to a wide scope of practice dependent on medical versus traumatic etiology. **Medical** Medical cardiac arrest patients are treated with ALS as discussed above. These patients can also be placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[13] This allows for oxygenation of the victim's blood supply until the cardiac function is restored. **Trauma** Trauma patients can be divided into blunt (motor vehicle accident) versus penetrating (gun-shot wound). Blunt traumatic arrests are usually secondary to a large vessel injury. Patients usually succumb to their injuries immediately after the event takes place. Most blunt trauma arrest patients are deemed to be futile upon arrival of first responders. Victims of penetrating trauma are more like to survive when compared to blunt traumatic arrests.[14] Penetrating trauma patients are typically treated with bilateral needle decompressions. If ROSC is not obtained and if within a non-futile time frame, patients can undergo a resuscitative thoracotomy. This will allow for direct visualization and, if needed, an intervention of the heart, lungs and large vessels.[14] Another technique that is still under evaluation is resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA).[15] This involves the placement of an endovascular balloon within the aorta to control hemorrhage, similar to cross-clamping the aorta, which is a manual technique to control hemorrhage during a resuscitative thoracotomy. ## Differential Diagnosis Syncope is a temporary loss of consciousness that is usually caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. Patients who experience syncope are transiently unresponsive as are all individuals experiencing cardiac arrest. However, patients who are in cardiac arrest will not have a normal
