34% Hb/cell. Hypochromia refers to a low MCHC, while normochromic describes a normal MCHC. Hypochromic anemia may be due to decreased Hb production, the most common cause being iron deficiency (less commonly copper deficiency, pyridoxine deficiency, or lead poisoning), or due to reticulocytosis, as reticulocytes have a lower concentration of Hb compared to mature red blood cells. Increased MCHC can be due to red blood cell morphology abnormalities, such as spherocytosis and xerocytosis or hemoglobinopathies. More commonly, high MCHC represents an artifact such as in the following: - Lipemia, which spuriously elevates Hb and consequently MCHC - Hemolysis, where Hb is disproportionally elevated to Hct within the sample - Red cell agglutination, which spuriously lowers the red cell concentration and elevates MCV - Leukocytosis, which spuriously elevates MCV - Hyperbilirubinemia, which spuriously lowers Hb Examination of a peripheral blood smear is useful in such a case to evaluate red blood cell morphology and exclude other contributing factors, as mentioned above.[4][13][14] **White Blood Cell Tests** **White blood cell count** WBC, or the absolute WBC, is the number of white blood cells present per blood microliter (μL). The normal reference interval in adults is usually 4500 to 11000 cells/μL. Leukopenia is defined as a low WBC and may be due to reduced production, increased utilization, or increased destruction of white blood cells. A spurious leukopenia may occur due to white blood cell clumping. An elevated white blood cell count is called leukocytosis and may be caused by an inflammatory stressor or myeloproliferative pathology. A spurious leucocytosis may occur in the setting of: - Reticulocytosis, where nucleated red blood cells are counted as white blood cells - Platelet clumping, where aggregate platelets are counted as white blood cells - Fibrin clumps - Cryoproteinemia Identification of a WBC abnormality is followed by an assessment of the white cell differential to identify which white blood cell types are affected. The differential may be reported as a percentage of the total WBC or as an absolute count for each mature white cell type.[15] **Neutrophil count** The neutrophil count is the number of neutrophils per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or, as an absolute number, absolute neutrophil count. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 40% to 60% of the absolute WBC or 1500 to 8000 cells/µL. Neutrophilia, which refers to an increase in the neutrophil count, can be
