This condition can occur before, during, or after laborâ€”with the highest risk within the first postpartum week. While preeclampsia, marked by hypertension and proteinuria, often precedes eclampsia, it may also develop without prior warning signs. Symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances, and altered mental status are common, though eclampsia can manifest suddenly. Immediate management, including seizure control with magnesium sulfate and timely delivery, is critical to preventing maternal and fetal complications. This course enhances healthcare professionals' ability to recognize the signs of eclampsia, understand its risk factors, and implement evidence-based interventions for management. Participants learn to coordinate care with an interprofessional team, including obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists, to ensure timely intervention and optimal outcomes. Emphasizing early recognition and collaboration, the course improves patient outcomes by reducing delays in treatment and enhancing maternal and fetal safety during and after eclampsia episodes. **Objectives:** - Identify the early signs and symptoms of eclampsia, including new-onset seizures, severe headaches, and visual disturbances. - Differentiate eclampsia from other neurological conditions such as epilepsy or cerebrovascular events. - Implement evidence-based protocols for managing eclampsia, including the administration of magnesium sulfate. - Develop and implement interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients with eclampsia.

Eclampsia typically manifests through new-onset seizures, which can be tonic-clonic, focal, or multifocal; these seizures must occur in the absence of underlying causes such as epilepsy or cerebrovascular events. Eclampsia most frequently develops in the first 48 hours postpartum; however, this condition can arise before, during, or after labor. The highest risk of occurrence is within the first postpartum week.[1] In some cases, eclampsia may develop without preceding preeclampsia signs, such as hypertension or proteinuria.[2] Eclampsia is a significant cause of maternal mortality. Seizures can lead to severe complications like maternal hypoxia, trauma, and aspiration pneumonia, though long-term neurological damage is
