blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or, as an absolute number, absolute neutrophil count. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 40% to 60% of the absolute WBC or 1500 to 8000 cells/µL. Neutrophilia, which refers to an increase in the neutrophil count, can be due to infection, trauma, tissue necrosis, physical or emotional stress, smoking, myeloproliferative disease, chronic inflammatory disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), vasculitides, chronic hepatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute gout, congenital conditions (such as Down syndrome and hereditary idiopathic neutrophilia), blood loss, hemolytic anemia, obesity, pregnancy, or medications. Neutropenia, which refers to a decrease in the neutrophil count, can be due to bone marrow failure (due to myeloproliferative diseases, lymphoproliferative disease, metastatic malignancy, myelodysplasia or irradiation), megaloblastic anemia, hereditary, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), hypersplenism, hemodialysis, viral infection (such as cytomegalovirus, measles, rubella, human immunodeficiency virus, Dengue fever, infectious mononucleosis), bacterial infections (such as typhoid fever or septicemia), protozoal infections, idiopathic, or drug-induced. **Lymphocyte count** The lymphocyte count is the number of lymphocytes per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 20% to 40% of the absolute WBC or 1000 to 4000 cells/µL. Lymphocytosis, which refers to an increase in the lymphocyte count, may be due to viral infection, pertussis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, hyposplenism, or lymphoproliferative disease. Lymphocytopenia, which refers to a decrease in the lymphocyte count, may be due to viral infection, bacterial infection, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease), malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, primary immunodeficiency diseases or medications.[16][17] **Monocyte count** The monocyte count is the number of monocytes per microliter of blood and is expressed as a percentage of the WBC or as an absolute number. The normal reference interval in adults is usually 2% to 8% or 200 to 1000 cells/µL. Monocytosis, an increase in the monocyte count, can be caused by viral or parasitic infection, brucellosis, tuberculosis, listeriosis, endocarditis, granulomatous disease, autoimmune disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia, cigarette smoking, or medications. Monocytopenia, a decrease in the monocyte count, is observed in infection, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), aplastic anemia, lymphoproliferative disease (particularly hairy
