most common being an iliac artery aneurysm. Peripheral aneurysms are also associated with approximately 5% of patients, with popliteal artery aneurysms being the most common. ## Evaluation The diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually made using ultrasound (see **Images.** Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Ultrasound and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Illustration). However, a computed tomography (CT) scan remains necessary to determine other vessels' exact location, size, and involvement and is the preferred imaging modality for symptomatic individuals. The ultrasound can be used for screening purposes but is less accurate for aneurysms located above the renal arteries due to the presence of overlying air-containing lungs and viscera. CT angiography requires ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast; however, magnetic resonance angiography can delineate the anatomy and does not require ionizing radiation. Most of these aneurysms are located below the origin of the renal arteries and may be classified as saccular (localized) or fusiform (circumferential). More than 90% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are fusiform. Intense inflammation, a thickened peel, and adhesions to adjacent structures characterize an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Angiography is now rarely performed for diagnostic purposes due to the superior image quality achieved with CT scans.[15] See **Images.** Ruptured Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Infrarenal Abdominal Aneurysm, Computed Angiogram. Magnetic resonance angiography is an option for patients with allergies to contrast media. An echocardiogram is recommended as many patients also tend to have associated heart disease. All patients require routine blood work, including a cross-match if surgery is necessary. Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart disease should be diagnosed by the relevant specialist and cleared for surgery. Cardiovascular risk factor modification should be achieved with smoking cessation, blood pressure control, statin, antiplatelet therapy, and healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise.[16] The previously advocated use of beta-blocker therapy has been disproven for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of AAA expansion and rupture.[17] ## Treatment / Management The treatment of unruptured AAA is recommended when the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.5 cm in men and 5.0 cm in women,[16][18] shows a rapid enlargement of greater than 0.5 cm over 6 months, or if it becomes symptomatic. Thus, according to recent guidelines from the European Society for Vascular Surgery, AAA repair is recommended if the aneurysm is symptomatic and greater than 4 cm, and has increased in size by greater than 1 cm/year, as measured by the inner-to-inner maximum
