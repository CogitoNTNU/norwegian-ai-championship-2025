with user age ranging from the 8th grade to the collegiate level and adulthood. A review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s and early 2000s. For example, lifetime MDMA use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 and 1990, while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 and 1999.[10] From 1999 to 2000, lifetime use among 8th graders increased from 2.7% to 4.3%, while this increase was significantly greater in 12th graders (8%-11%). Also, emergency room visits in the United States increased from 253 to 4511 between 1994 and 2000.[11] A 2002 Monitoring the Future study found that 12.7% of United States college students had used ecstasy once in their lifetime. The 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health found a greater than 200% increase in MDMA use by adults 18 to 25 years old from 1996 to 2002.[10] While the number of users increased significantly from the early 1990s and 2000s, the number of new users varied from 2002 to 2007. Surveys found a decrease in users from 1.2 million in 2002 to 642,000 in 2003, then up to 860,000 from 2006 to 2007.[12] In 2011, data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated about 14.5 million users aged 12 or older had used MDMA at least once in their lifetime, with approximately 900,000 using it for the first time in 2011. This number increased to 17 million in 2013, with the highest use among young adults aged 18 to 25. Though MDMA use is less prevalent than cannabis, opioid, and other amphetamine use in the United States and worldwide, it remains a significant public health concern due to its adverse effect profile.[8] ## Pathophysiology The difference between MDMA and other amphetamines is due to the attachment of the methylenedioxy group, which is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogen mescaline. MDMA is a compound with characteristics of both amphetamines and hallucinogens.[13] It primarily increases the concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin within the synaptic cleft. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and stimulates its carrier-mediated release into synapses. Like other amphetamine analogs, MDMA also inhibits monoamine oxidase activity, which further contributes to increased serotonin levels (in addition to dopamine and norepinephrine). Like serotonin, MDMA affects dopamine transporters by promoting release
