meningitis score, with a sensitivity of 99% to 100% and a specificity of 52% to 62%, stands out as the most specific tool currently accessible. Other laboratory findings, such as procalcitonin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and CSF lactate levels, can provide valuable insights to differentiate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis. Before conducting an LP, if there is suspicion of elevated intracranial pressure caused by a space-occupying lesion or inflammation, it is advisable to obtain a head computed tomography (CT) scan before proceeding with the LP, as recommended.[4][16] A CT scan can offer an alternative diagnosis, eliminating the need for the LP. CT scans are typically unnecessary in neonates and infants with open fontanelles. For this age group, head ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality.[4][17] Research has demonstrated that imaging might be safely avoided if all criteria are absent: age greater than or equal to 60, history of central nervous system disease, immunocompromised state, altered mental state, seizure within one week of presentation, and neurological deficits.[2][4] These guidelines help healthcare professionals make informed decisions, ensuring appropriate and targeted use of imaging resources in patients suspected of having neurological conditions. ## Treatment / Management Early recognition of the likely cause of meningitis is vital for initiating treatment promptly. Initial patient stabilization is crucial, and studies have demonstrated the benefits of intravenous fluids (IV) administered over 48 hours.[4] If bacterial meningitis is suspected, it is imperative to promptly start empiric antibiotics, ensuring broad coverage based on the most likely pathogens within specific age groups, especially in pediatric cases.[4] Ideally, obtaining CSF fluid should precede antibiotic administration. However, initiating antibiotic therapy promptly is essential if this would cause a delay in treatment or if the patient is critically ill. Additionally, it is crucial to place the patient on droplet isolation precautions until the cause of the infection is identified. If HSV or (VZV) is suspected, intravenous acyclovir should be included in the empiric treatment regimen.[4] If the CSF fluid results are more consistent with aseptic meningitis, discontinuing antibiotics should be considered, considering the patient's initial presentation and clinical status. Management of viral meningitis (excluding HSV and VZV) primarily involves supportive care.[4] Specific treatments for various bacteria, fungi, and others are beyond the scope of this activity. However, as discussed earlier, these treatments should be tailored based on individual clinical presentation and underlying health conditions. Steroids are employed as adjunctive therapy to mitigate the inflammatory
