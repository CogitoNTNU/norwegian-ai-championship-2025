AKI can be differentiated into prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal etiologies, and these etiologies can be overlapping and interrelated. Distinguishing the causes of AKI is fundamental to effectively and efficiently treating AKI, which improves patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients affected by this condition. **Objectives:** - Identify the risk factors and clinical indicators associated with acute kidney injury to facilitate early recognition and intervention. - Differentiate between prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes of acute kidney injury, utilizing diagnostic tools and clinical assessment to guide appropriate treatment strategies. - Implement evidence-based guidelines for preventing and managing acute kidney injury, including optimizing fluid resuscitation, adjusting medications, and addressing underlying causes. - Communicate effectively with patients and their families, providing clear explanations of acute kidney injury, its causes, and the proposed treatment plan.

AKI can lead to the accumulation of water, sodium, and other metabolic products. AKI can also result in other electrolyte disturbances. AKI is a prevalent condition, especially among hospitalized patients, and can be seen in up to 7% of hospital admissions and 30% of ICU admissions. Several criteria have been used to identify AKI, such as RIFLE, AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network), and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria. Among these, KDIGO is the most recent and most commonly used tool.
