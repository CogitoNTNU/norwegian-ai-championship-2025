pulmonary embolism clots. **EKOS-CDT** - Central conductor: The EKOS-IDDC serves as the central conduit for intervention. This multi-lumen catheter allows simultaneous delivery of a thrombolytic agent (eg, rt-PA) and saline coolant directly to the target thrombus. - Sonic disruption module: The MicroSonic Device (MSD) nested within the IDDC harbors multiple ultrasound transducers that emit targeted low-frequency sonic waves to facilitate clot fragmentation and enhance drug penetration. - Hemodynamic monitoring: Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters (eg, pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output) and electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the procedure and guiding therapeutic adjustments.[22] **BEC-CDT** - Expandable catheter: The 7-F BEC-CDT occupies the central role in this system. Its unique feature is an expandable "basket" equipped with 48 orifices, allowing for strategic deployment and maximizing drug-thrombus contact within the clot. - Pulse spray delivery: A dedicated syringe administers controlled "pulse sprays" of the thrombolytic agent, creating initial fissures within the clot. Subsequently, a continuous infusion pump ensures sustained thrombolysis. - Fluoroscopic visualization: Real-time fluoroscopy offers visual guidance for catheter placement, ensuring optimal positioning of the expanding basket within the target thrombus.[21] **Shared Instrumental Landscape** - Venous access establishment: Both procedures require initial venous access, typically achieved using a micropuncture needle and introducer sheath, contingent upon individual patient anatomy and institutional protocols. - Guidewire navigation: A guidewire serves as the forerunner, facilitating the catheters' navigation to the target thrombus within the pulmonary artery. - Anticoagulation support: Anticoagulant therapy plays a crucial role in both paradigms, preventing further clot formation and maintaining vascular patency throughout the procedure. ## Personnel The new guidelines recommend a PERT approach at healthcare facilities.[23] The PERT is a multidisciplinary team specialized in diagnosing and managing acute pulmonary embolism. It brings together experts from various specialties to collaborate on optimal patient care. PERTs usually focus on submassive and massive pulmonary embolism cases but can also benefit low-risk patients with major contraindications to standard anticoagulation, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Critical considerations for PERT activation include the following: - The initiation of anticoagulation remains crucial and should not be delayed unless contraindicated. - PERT activation should occur concurrently with implementing treatment recommendations. - The PERT structure varies by institution but may involve specialties such as critical care, pulmonology, cardiology, interventional radiology, and more. - Each member plays a specific role in patient care, from diagnosis and risk stratification to procedures and medication management.
