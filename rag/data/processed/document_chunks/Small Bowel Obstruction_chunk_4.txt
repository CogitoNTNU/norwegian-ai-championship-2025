is often required to untwist the bowel and prevent ischemia. **Pediatric** Congenital or acquired adhesions are the most common causes of SBO. The second most common cause is intussusception. Other causes include congenital atresia, volvulus, ingestion of foreign bodies, and Meckel diverticulum.[17] ## Epidemiology SBO is a common surgical emergency, contributing to 15% to 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain and accounting for approximately 80% of all bowel obstructions. Each year, over 300,000 laparotomies are performed in the United States for SBO. The incidence of SBO is closely associated with the prevalence of abdominal surgeries, as postoperative adhesions are the leading cause, responsible for more than 75% of cases.[18] The risk of SBO increases with the number of prior intraabdominal procedures, emphasizing the importance of surgical history in assessing patient risk. SBO is observed across all age groups but is more common in older adults due to higher rates of abdominal surgeries, malignancies, and hernias. Sex differences in etiology are evident, with women more prone to adhesion-related SBO due to gynecological procedures, while men are more likely to experience hernia-related obstruction. In low-resource settings, hernias are a predominant cause due to limited access to elective hernia repair surgeries. SBO is less common in children and typically results from congenital abnormalities such as malrotation or intussusception. Over the past 4 decades, advancements in imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy, and laparoscopic techniques have significantly altered the management of SBO. Before 1981, surgery was the definitive treatment. Since then, adopting nonoperative protocols has improved patient selection for timely surgical intervention, such as laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Despite these advancements, recurrent SBO remains a concern, with a recurrence rate of 12% to 32% after initial surgical management. Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to complications such as strangulation, bowel ischemia, and sepsisâ€”conditions associated with a mortality rate exceeding 25%. While improved diagnostic modalities have enhanced outcomes in developed nations, delays in care and limited access to advanced surgical techniques remain significant challenges in resource-constrained settings. Understanding the epidemiology of SBO is critical for developing preventive measures, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing the global burden of this condition. ## Pathophysiology SBO results from an interruption in the normal flow of intestinal contents due to a mechanical blockage or functional impairment. This disruption triggers a series of pathological processes affecting the bowel wall, vascular supply, and systemic physiology. These processes can escalate rapidly, especially in cases
