echocardiograms or CT/MRI) to monitor aortic size and integrity. Education should include the frequency and importance of these follow-ups, even without symptoms. **Genetic Counseling and Screening** For individuals with a family history of AAD or related connective tissue disorders, genetic counseling is crucial: - First-degree relatives of patients with a history of AAD should be screened for aortic abnormalities. Genetic testing may be recommended, and positive results warrant routine surveillance and preventive measures. - Women with a history of connective tissue disorders or aortic pathology should receive preconception counseling to assess the risk of aortic complications during pregnancy. Management strategies, such as elective repair prior to conception or high-risk obstetric care, should be discussed. **Psychosocial Support and Patient Education** The emotional burden of living with a risk for AAD or managing its aftermath can be significant. Providing patients and families with access to educational resources about AAD and support groups can improve coping mechanisms and adherence to management strategies. **Emergency Plans** Patients at high risk for AAD should have a clear emergency action plan. This includes: - Knowing the location of the nearest hospital with advanced imaging capabilities - Understanding when and how to call emergency services (eg, for sudden severe pain or neurological symptoms) - Having a summary of their medical history, including prior imaging results and medications, readily available for healthcare providers in case of an emergency ## Pearls and Other Issues Despite optimal circumstances, diagnosing every case of AAD in the emergency department remains a significant challenge. One contributing factor is the variability in symptom severity, as some patients may present with relatively mild symptoms that do not immediately raise suspicion for AAD. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings may also mimic other conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis. Another factor complicating diagnosis is the absence of expected physical exam findings, such as a pulse deficit or a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, which are not always present even in confirmed cases of AAD. Every patient presenting with chest pain must be approached with the consideration that they could potentially have an AAD to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses. Establishing a detailed risk factor profile, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and being vigilant about atypical or subtle presentations are critical components of effective evaluation and diagnosis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective management of aortic dissection requires a coordinated, patient-centered approach involving
