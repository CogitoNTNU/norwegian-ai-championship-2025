for patients 65 and older in the United States, and rates of hospitalizations increased from 2014 to 2017.[23] Approximately 6.7 million Americans older than 25 are estimated to have some form of heart failure; this number is expected to increase to 8.5 million Americans by 2030.[23] The incidence and prevalence of heart failure increase with age.[17] The lifetime risk of heart failure has increased from approximately 20% to 24%, possibly due to an increase in life expectancy and the incidence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.[24] Data gathered from the second 25-year epoch of the Framingham Heart Study (1990-2014) has demonstrated that the lifetime risk of HFpEF approximates 19.3%, exceeding the approximate 11.4% lifetime risk of HFrEF.[23][24] This appears to be particularly true for women, whose apparent lifetime risk of HFpEF is 10.7% compared to 5.8% for HFrEF; these risks vary with ethnicity.[25][26] The incidence and prevalence of HFpEF varies among populations and is increasing overall; this increase may partially be due to improved diagnostic capabilities and more uniform diagnostic parameters. Tsao et al. reported an increase of 53% in HFpEF diagnoses among participants in the Framingham Heart Study and Cardiovascular Health Study between 2000 and 2009.[27] Chang et al. reported an 8.2% increase in HFpEF diagnoses among Black women compared to a 5.9% increase for White women; all patients participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study between 2005 and 2014.[26] The same study demonstrated a rise in HFpEF diagnoses for Black men (5.7%) and White men (6.3%).[26] Contrarily, data derived from Olmstead County in Minnesota demonstrated a decrease of 28% in the incidence of HFpEF diagnoses between 2000 and 2010.[23] While it is clear that the overall prevalence of heart failure is increasing globally, the incidence and prevalence of heart failure demonstrate significant geographic differences. However, data are lacking from some geographic areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and differences in diagnostic criteria and reporting practices across the globe limit the accuracy of comparative data. Despite these limitations, when available data are derived from studies that define HFpEF as an ejection fraction of â‰¥50%, stark geographic differences in prevalence emerge. Shiga et al. reported an HFpEF prevalence of 43% in 1245 patients with heart failure hospitalized in Japan between 2013 and 2014.[28] Wang et al. evaluated 5236 patients in a community-based heart failure management program in Australia and reported a 37.4% prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses.[29] In contrast,
