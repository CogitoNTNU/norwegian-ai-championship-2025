Risk factors for STEMI include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of plaque instability. The pathogenic mechanism typically involves plaque rupture and thrombus formation within the coronary artery, though other processes may also lead to STEMI. Diagnosis of STEMI is confirmed by characteristic findings on electrocardiography, including ST-segment elevation in specific leads. Blood tests, such as elevated cardiac troponins, further support the diagnosis. Immediate treatment involves restoring blood flow to the affected area through reperfusion therapy, typically via percutaneous coronary intervention. Early management is critical to limit myocardial damage, and adjunctive therapies, including antiplatelets and anticoagulants, are often used to prevent further thrombus formation. This activity for healthcare professionals reviews the etiology, epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of STEMI and underscores the integral role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients with this type of myocardial infarction. **Objectives:** - Identify the signs and symptoms suggesting acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. - Create a clinically guided diagnostic plan for patients with suspected acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. - Implement evidence-based, individualized management protocols for patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. - Collaborate with the interprofessional team to educate, treat, and monitor individuals with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to improve health outcomes.

Globally, over 7 million individuals are diagnosed with ACS annually, with more than 1 million cases requiring hospitalization in the United States each year. STEMI results from the complete blockage of a coronary artery and represents about 30% of all ACS cases. An acute STEMI is marked by transmural myocardial ischemia resulting in myocardial injury or necrosis.[1] The current 2018 clinical definition of myocardial infarction
