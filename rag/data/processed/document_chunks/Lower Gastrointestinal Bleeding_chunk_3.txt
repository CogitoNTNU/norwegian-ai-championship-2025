attempting to correct it. **Risk Stratification** Specific risk calculators attempt to help identify patients who would benefit from ICU level of care; most stratify based on mortality risk. The AIMS65 score and the Rockall score calculate the mortality rate of upper GI bleeds. There are two separate Rockall scores; One is calculated before endoscopy and identifies pre-endoscopy mortality, whereas the second score is calculated post-endoscopy and calculates overall mortality and re-bleeding risks. The Oakland score is a risk calculator that attempts to help calculate the probability of a safe discharge in lower GI bleeds.[11] **Setting** - ICU - Patients with hemodynamic instability, continuous bleeding, or those with a significant risk of morbidity/mortality should undergo monitoring in an intensive care unit to facilitate more frequent observation of vital signs and more emergent therapeutic intervention. - General Medical Ward - Most other patients can undergo monitoring on a general medical floor. However, they would likely benefit from continuous telemetry monitoring for earlier recognition of hemodynamic compromise. - Outpatient - Most patients with GI bleeding will require hospitalization. However, some young, healthy patients with self-limited and asymptomatic bleeding may be safely discharged and evaluated on an outpatient basis. **Treatments** - Nothing by mouth - Provide supplemental oxygen if the patient is hypoxic (typically via nasal cannula, but patients with ongoing hematemesis or altered mental status may require intubation). Avoid non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to the risk of aspiration with ongoing vomiting. - Adequate IV access - at least two large-bore peripheral IVs (18 gauge or larger) or a centrally placed cordis - IV fluid resuscitation (with normal saline or lactated Ringer solution) - Blood grouping and cross match - Transfusions - RBC transfusion - Typically started if hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, including in patients with coronary heart disease[12][13] - Platelet transfusion - started if the platelet count is less than 50,000/microL - Prothrombin complex concentrate - Transfuse if INR is more than 2 - Medications - PPIs - Used empirically for upper GI bleeds and can be continued or discontinued upon identification of the bleeding source - Prokinetic agents - Given to improve visualization at the time of endoscopy - Vasoactive medications - Somatostatin and its analog octreotide can be used to treat variceal bleeding by inhibiting vasodilatory hormone release[14] - Antibiotics - Considered prophylactically in patients with cirrhosis to prevent translocation, especially from endoscopy - Anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents -
