performed.[6][1] Surgical options include salpingostomy and salpingectomy. Salpingectomy generally involves the partial or complete removal of the fallopian tube. Salpingostomy, also known as salpingotomy, entails removing the ectopic pregnancy through a tubal incision while keeping the fallopian tube intact. Both methods yield similar outcomes concerning future intrauterine pregnancy rates and the recurrence of ectopic pregnancies. The choice to remove or preserve the fallopian tube relies on intraoperative evaluation and the patient's fertility objectives. In instances of significant tubal damage, rupture, or previous tubal ligation, salpingectomy is the preferred approach. Patients with an intact contralateral fallopian tube experience comparable reproductive outcomes, whether they opt for salpingostomy or salpingectomy. For interstitial ectopic pregnancies, hysterectomy may be necessary for patients who experience severe hemorrhaging or do not wish to preserve fertility. **Cervical and Cesarean Scar Ectopic Pregnancy** Specialized approaches are required for cervical and cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies. For cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies, expectant management is not recommended due to the risk of uterine rupture and hemorrhage, except in select cases of confirmed fetal demise. Surgical options such as transvaginal or laparoscopic resection have demonstrated low complication rates. Curettage alone is not recommended due to the risk of hemorrhage and incomplete removal of trophoblastic tissue. In cases where fertility preservation is not a priority, hysterectomy may be considered.[5][2] Medical management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy typically involves local or intragestational methotrexate injections, often with systemic methotrexate. Systemic methotrexate alone is not recommended due to higher failure rates and complications. Ultrasound-guided aspiration may complement medical therapy. Posttreatment monitoring is essential, as Î²-hCG levels and mass size may take weeks to resolve.[5][2] ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses to consider with ectopic pregnancies include: - Ovarian torsion - Tubo-ovarian abscess - Appendicitis - Hemorrhagic corpus luteum - Ovarian cyst rupture - Threatened miscarriage - Incomplete miscarriage - Pelvic inflammatory disease - Ureteral calculi [1] ## Prognosis The prognosis for ectopic pregnancy depends on early diagnosis and timely intervention. If identified and treated before rupture, either medically with methotrexate or surgically, the risk of severe complications is significantly reduced. However, delayed diagnosis can lead to tubal rupture, resulting in life-threatening hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. In such cases, emergency surgical intervention is required, which may involve salpingectomy, potentially impacting future fertility.[4][6] Patients with a history of ectopic pregnancy are at increased risk for recurrence, particularly if underlying risk factors such as prior tubal surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, or
