inhibitor. If PCI is considered the treatment option for an acute MI, it is recommended to perform the procedure within 12 hours of symptom onset. If fibrinolytic therapy is considered the primary reperfusion strategy, it should be initiated within 120 minutes. In addition to reperfusion strategies, parenteral anticoagulation is recommended for all patients with acute MI, regardless of whether they undergo PCI or receive fibrinolytic therapy. ## Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnoses for AMI include the following: - **Aortic dissection:** This is a life-threatening condition with a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, leading to the separation of the layers and potential obstruction of blood flow. - **Pericarditis:** Inflammation of the pericardium can cause chest pain that may resemble an AMI. - **Acute gastritis:** Inflammation of the stomach lining can cause upper abdominal pain that may be mistaken for cardiac-related chest pain. - **Acute cholecystitis:** Inflammation of the gallbladder can cause right upper-quadrant abdominal pain that can radiate to the chest and mimic cardiac symptoms. - **Asthma:** Acute asthma exacerbation can lead to shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness, which may be mistaken for cardiac symptoms. - **Esophagitis:** Inflammation of the esophagus can cause chest pain, mainly if it is related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or other esophageal disorders. - **Myocarditis:** Heart muscle inflammation can present with chest pain and other symptoms similar to AMI. - **Pneumothorax:** A collapsed lung can cause sudden chest pain and difficulty breathing, mimicking cardiac-related symptoms. - **Pulmonary embolism:** Blockage of a pulmonary artery by a blood clot can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms that may resemble an AMI. ## Prognosis AMI carries a significant risk of mortality outside of the hospital environment. Data indicate that at least one-third of patients succumb to the condition before reaching the hospital, and an additional 40% to 50% do not survive upon arrival. Furthermore, another 5% to 10% of patients will experience mortality within the first 12 months after an MI. The prognosis of AMI depends on the extent of muscle damage. Better outcomes are seen in patients who undergo early perfusion, including thrombolytic therapy within 30 minutes of arrival or PCI within 90 minutes. Patients with preserved ejection fraction have better outcomes than those with reduced ejection fraction. Medical management following an AMI is crucial for improving long-term outcomes. Initiating medications, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors, is
