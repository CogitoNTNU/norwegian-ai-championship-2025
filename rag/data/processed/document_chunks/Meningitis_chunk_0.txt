The condition is diagnosed through CSF pleocytosis, with an elevated white blood cell count. Aseptic meningitis is prevalent and typically benign, but the clinical manifestations can vary widely based on the underlying cause and the patient's immune status. Close evaluation and treatment involving an interprofessional team are crucial for effectively managing patients with aseptic meningitis. This activity explores the diverse etiologies of aseptic meningitis, the broad spectrum of clinical presentations associated with aseptic meningitis, and the significance of an interprofessional approach to patient care. Clinicians engaged in this activity will enhance their diagnostic skills, broaden their understanding of the condition's complexities, and refine their approach to managing patients with aseptic meningitis. By integrating this knowledge into their clinical practice, clinicians will be better equipped to deliver high-quality care, improving patient outcomes and safety. **Objectives:** - Differentiate between various etiologies of aseptic meningitis while understanding the unique features associated with viral, bacterial, and noninfectious causes and considering factors like immune status and patient history. - Implement effective screening methods, utilizing appropriate diagnostic tests and criteria to identify aseptic meningitis in patients presenting with compatible symptoms promptly. - Implement evidence-based interventions tailored to the specific etiology of aseptic meningitis, including antiviral therapies, supportive care, and, when applicable, collaborating with specialists for targeted treatments. - Collaborate with interdisciplinary team members, including infectious disease specialists, neurologists, nurses, and pharmacists, to improve care coordination.

This condition is typically diagnosed based on CSF pleocytosis, indicated by an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 5 cells/mmÂ³.[1] Aseptic meningitis is a prevalent and generally benign inflammatory disorder affecting the meninges.[2] Viruses, such as herpes simplex \_\_ virus type 2 (HSV-2), enteroviruses, and arboviruses are the most common causes of
