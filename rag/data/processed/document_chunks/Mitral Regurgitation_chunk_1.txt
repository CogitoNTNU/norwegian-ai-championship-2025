Acute severe MR, often caused by papillary muscle rupture or leaflet perforation from infective endocarditis, leads to significant hemodynamic instability, acute volume overload, and congestionâ€”necessitating immediate surgical intervention.[3] Chronic MR can be categorized into 2 types: primary and secondary. Primary MR is caused by a primary abnormality of 1 or more components of the valve apparatus (leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, annulus).\*\*\*\* In contrast, secondary MR is caused by alterations in left ventricular or left atrial function and shape. If mild and asymptomatic, chronic MR can be medically managed and monitored over time. However, patients with symptomatic chronic MR should undergo evaluation for potential surgical intervention.[3][4] In cases of patients who are asymptomatic with chronic MR, surgical consideration may be warranted if they exhibit signs of depressed left ventricular function and dilatation, atrial fibrillation, or pulmonary hypertension.[5][6] Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial imaging modality for screening and evaluating mitral valve morphology and pathology and determining the mechanism of MR. TTE also helps quantify the severity of MR and assess left ventricular function and size, and left atrial size.[3] Various parameters are used for qualitative and quantitative MR assessment, including a 2-dimensional analysis of mitral valve leaflet characteristics, motion, coaptation, MR jet to left atrial area ratio, vena contracta, effective regurgitant orifice area, regurgitant volume, regurgitant area, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic area. In cases where TTE images do not provide adequate information, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can offer a more detailed assessment.[7][8] Three-dimensional TEE can provide an "enface" view of the MV, resembling a surgical inspection, which can greatly aid discussions and preprocedure planning (see **Image.** Mitral Valve, En Face View). In situations where TEE is contraindicated, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an alternative option, providing highly accurate data for MR assessment and evaluation of left ventricle dimensions. Results from recent studies have shown percutaneous mitral valve repair as a viable alternative for high-surgical-risk patients suffering from severe symptomatic MR.
