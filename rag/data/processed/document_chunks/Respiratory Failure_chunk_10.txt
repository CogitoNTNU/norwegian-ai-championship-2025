In 2017, in the United States of America, however, the in-hospital respiratory failure mortality rate was 12%. The case definition used in this study included all diagnosis codes, which included respiratory failure.[2] In-hospital mortality rates for patients requiring intubation with mechanical ventilation for asthma exacerbation, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia were found to be 9.8%, 38.3%, and 48.4%, respectively.[37][38][39] Lastly, the in-hospital mortality rate for acute respiratory distress syndrome was found to be 44.3%.[40] ## Complications Respiratory failure is associated with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, especially in the acute setting. Pulmonary complications include bronchopleural fistula, nosocomial pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary fibrosis, while extrapulmonary complications include acid-base disturbances, decreased cardiac output, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic failure, ileus, infection, increased intracranial pressure, malnutrition, pneumoperitoneum, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Clinicians should be aware of the conditions mentioned earlier and be prepared to offer prophylactic therapy or proper treatment for such complications when applicable.[41][42] ## Consultations Depending on the severity of the respiratory failure, consultation with a Pulmonary specialist may be warranted in the patient's care. ## Deterrence and Patient Education While patients should be educated on the symptoms of respiratory failure, they should also be aware of the importance of device and medication compliance, as well as modifiable risk factors and how they relate to disease prevention. For instance, the following strategies are efficacious in preventing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Adherence to pharmacological therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and vaccination (i.e., influenza and pneumococcal).[43] Unfortunately, not all causes of respiratory failure are preventable. Patients should seek prompt evaluation and treatment if they become symptomatic. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Diagnosing the underlying cause of respiratory failure and its treatment is challenging as this syndrome can result from numerous pulmonary and extrapulmonary
