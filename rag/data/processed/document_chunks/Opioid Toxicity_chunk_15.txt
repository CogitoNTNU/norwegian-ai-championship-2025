minutes, making it a viable option for community and prehospital use. A retrospective study of Basic Life Support (BLS) crews administering prehospital intranasal naloxone over 6 years found that 95% of patients who received treatment showed clinical benefits before arrival. Less than 10% of patients required additional doses in the emergency department, and 70% were eventually discharged. **Opioid poisoning in children** The dose of naloxone for children who are younger than 5 or weigh less than 20 kg is 0.1 mg/kg. For children who are older than 5 or weigh more than 20 kg, the dose ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg. Repeat dosing may be required every 3 to 4 minutes, up to a maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg of naloxone. Repeat dosing is often necessary when the child has ingested longer-acting opiates like methadone. A continuous naloxone infusion may be started, but caution must be taken to avoid overhydration, which could lead to pulmonary edema. The pharmacy may assist with determining the correct concentration of fluid and naloxone for safe administration, but repeat bolus dosing may be safer if a concentrated infusion is unavailable. **Use of combined buprenorphine and naloxone** Buprenorphine, in combination with naloxone, is widely available and used to treat OUD in the outpatient setting. Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist and antagonist at the opioid receptor. Anecdotal data indicate that the risk of overdose is lower with buprenorphine/naloxone compared to methadone. Naloxone has no oral bioavailability and is included in the formulation to deter intravenous use. Unfortunately, the sublingual preparation of buprenorphine and naloxone may also be easily abused. **Naloxone adverse effects** Naloxone has demonstrated a very safe side effect profile. Studies on opioid-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, naloxone can trigger acute opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-tolerant patients. These symptoms may include sudden aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting, which occur in approximately 30% of patients. Most symptoms are mild and short-lived, with fewer than 1% of patients requiring admission. Acute withdrawal is more likely with higher doses of naloxone. A rare but potential side effect of naloxone is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is thought to result from a sudden catecholamine surge, typically following the administration of high doses of naloxone. Treatment involves positive pressure ventilation, starting with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and escalating to endotracheal intubation
