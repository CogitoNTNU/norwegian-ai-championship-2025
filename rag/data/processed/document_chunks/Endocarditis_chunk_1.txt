term native valve endocarditis denotes a cardiac infection that involves the leaflets of the valves, the endocardial surface, chordae tendinae, congenital defects, and anastomosis sites. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined by an infection involving artificial valves, conduits, catheters, assist devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, or other artificial intracardiac structures. ## Etiology The etiology of infective endocarditis has its basis on whether the valve is native or prosthetic and for prosthetic valve endocarditis, the etiology is dependent upon the timing with the early phase defined as less than two months and the late phase defined as greater than 12 months. The native valve infective endocarditis is most commonly caused by _Streptococcus viridans_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. For the early phase, prosthetic valve endocarditis causative agents include coagulase-negative staphylococci (_Staphylococcus epidermidis_) and _Staphylococcus aureus_ whereas for the late phase the key culprits include _Streptococcus viridans_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. Enterococci enter the bloodstream as a consequence of gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts manipulation. _Streptococcus bovis_ and _Clostridium_ _septicum_ are associated with colonic malignancies whereas HACEK group agents (_Haemophilus_ , _Aggregatibacter_ (previously _Actinobacillus_), _Cardiobacterium_ , _Eikenella_ , _Kingella_) infect patients with poor dental hygiene or from needle contaminate with saliva in intravenous drug users. Fungal endocarditis is the gravest form of infective endocarditis, and the risk factors include prosthetic heart valves, intravenous drug use, and an immunocompromised state. ## Epidemiology Infective endocarditis can be community-acquired, or it can be related to healthcare exposure. The epidemiological trends and disease patterns of infective endocarditis have evolved across the globe. In developing countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the key risk factor, affected patients are usually younger, and community-acquired, penicillin-sensitive streptococci typically cause the infection.[1] In the developed world degenerative valve disease, malignancy, intravenous drug use, diabetes mellitus, and congenital heart disease are the predominant risk factors, and the mean age of the patients is older than the â€™70s. The cases of healthcare-acquired infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcal infection have surged over the past two decades owing to an increase in the use of invasive procedures, cardiovascular implantable electronic devices, long-term intravenous lines, percutaneous, minimally invasive, and prosthetic heart valves.[2] There has been an increased incidence of infective endocarditis after minimally invasive aortic valve surgery or percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement.[3] ## Pathophysiology The pathophysiologic underpinning of infective endocarditis involves the following steps: bacteremia (spontaneous or hospital-acquired) that delivers the pathogen to the surface of the valve, adherence of the circulating pathogen
