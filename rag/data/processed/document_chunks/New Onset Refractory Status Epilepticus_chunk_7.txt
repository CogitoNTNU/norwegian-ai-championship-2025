have been associated with propofol infusion syndrome leading to higher mortality and complications than midazolam and ketamine. Patients with NORSE (or FIRES) often have a poor response to antiepileptic medications, and continuous IV anesthetic agents should be started without further delay, given the disease process's refractory nature. Multiple anesthetic agents are required in approximately 1/3 of patients with NORSE to achieve seizure suppression, and often for prolonged periods.[11][16] Since no specific therapy exists for patients with NORSE/FIRES, experts recommend using immunotherapies as soon as possible since nearly half of the cases are associated with an autoimmune/paraneoplastic etiology.[15][37] First-line immunotherapy agents include steroids, IV immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis. Second-line options include tacrolimus, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and anakinra. Immunotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes and control seizures more effectively in adults as compared to children.[22][38] There are currently no randomized controlled trials or prospective studies to guide immunotherapy in such patients, and recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion and experience from case series. - Once the initial workup fails to elucidate a cause for RSE, and there is a high suspicion for NORSE, IV methylprednisolone should be started ideally within the first week at a dose of 1 gm/day for 3 to 5 days. - Alternatively, other first-line treatment options (IV immunoglobulin 0.4 gm/day for 3 to 5 days or plasmapheresis for 3 to 5 sessions on alternate days) can be used depending on patient characteristics and clinical context.[15][39] - If there is no response to first-line therapies, i.e., failure to wean anesthetic agents due to high risk of seizure recurrence or prolonged RSE, the following second-line immunotherapies can then be considered: IV rituximab 375 mg/m^2 weekly for four doses, or IV cyclophosphamide 500-1000 mg/m^2 monthly for 3 to 6 months. - Anakinra, a recombinant version of the human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been observed to reduce the seizure frequency and achieve remission in two case reports.[40][41] - Other therapeutic options (hypothermia, cannabidiol, ketogenic diet), although less studied, have also been attempted in NORSE patients with mixed results and need to be validated.[42][43][44] ## Differential Diagnosis In most of the cases of NORSE, an etiology remains unknown despite an extensive workup. However, autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis remains the most common identifiable etiology in NORSE.[11][45] Therefore, a detailed history and clinical examination should be sought as certain clinical features can point towards a specific underlying etiology leading to early immunotherapy during the acute phase, ultimately
