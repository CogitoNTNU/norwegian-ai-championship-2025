3 frames per second. The degree of stenosis or other abnormalities is identified by visual assessment. Imaging of the thoracic aorta begins by looking at the aortic root, the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the proximal descending aorta. The patient's head is tilted to the right and in the chin-up position for better access to the branches. An image of the arch at 40° LAO (left anterior oblique) is commonly acquired at the start of the procedure as it allows to describe the type of aortic arch which predicts the difficulty of the procedure, as type II and III arches make cannulation of the common carotid more difficult.[8] In imaging of the abdominal aorta, the patient lies in the supine position, and PA and 90° lateral views are used. The field of view includes the top of the diaphragm to the border of the iliac wings, and the first angiogram run is acquired with the pigtail catheter positioned at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (L1). Following this, the catheter is traditionally advanced to the level of the aortic bifurcation (L4), and the iliac vessels are imaged using anterior oblique projections. ## Complications Though overall complications related to angiography remain low, the risk of complications following conventional angiography is higher in the elderly, patients with reduced cardiac reserve, calcified non-compliant arteries, renal disease, and multiple comorbidities. **Minor Complications** - Bruising - Nausea - Pain at the puncture site - Minor allergic reactions like rash, itch, or hives - Transient deterioration in renal function - Transient hot flushes or burning sensation **Major Complications** - Significant bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm occur in \<5% of angiograms, and 1 in 100 patients require overnight admission in the observation unit, while 1 in 500–1000 patients will require a second intervention or blood transfusion to correct the bleeding.[9] - Significant allergic reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) - Acute renal failure Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a substantial source of morbidity, which might require a brief period of renal replacement therapy. The essential preventive measures for contrast related complications include adequate peri-procedural hydration and use of minimal contrast volume.[9] Cigarroa et al. estimated the maximal acceptable contrast dose (MACD) using the following equation: (5 x bodyweight in Kg) divided by serum creatinine in mg/dl; up to a maximum volume of 300ml.[10] However, this formula is less useful in high-risk patients such as those with anemia, diabetes, heart
