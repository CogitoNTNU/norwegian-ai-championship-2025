often leading to death due to aortic rupture or tamponade. ## Histopathology Aortic dissection is an acute life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen between the intima-media and media-adventitia layers (see **Image.** Aortic Dissection Seen in Histology). This process can lead to a sudden drop in systemic blood pressure and cause catastrophic complications such as hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, which can result in sudden death.[10] The dissection commonly occurs in the outer one-third of the aortic media, a structurally vulnerable area due to chronic injury and repair processes often triggered by hemodynamic forces like hypertension (see **Image.** Histologic Image of Aortic Dissection).[11] The dissection can progress in anterograde or retrograde directions, potentially obstructing branches of the aorta and leading to ischemia in organs such as the brain, heart, or kidneys. The media layer of the aorta, composed of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronic acid, undergoes pathological changes in the setting of chronic hypertension or genetic predisposition. These changes, collectively termed cystic medial degeneration, include: - Mucoid accumulation - This occurs in the extracellular matrix and increases the interlamellar or translamellar space, creating the so-called “cystic degeneration” of the media that decreases vessel resistance. The main component of mucin accumulation is chondroitin-6-sulfate.[12] - Alteration of elastic fibers - Under normal conditions, a dense meshwork of elastic fibers in the media maintains the aorta's structural integrity. These fibers provide elasticity and resistance to the constant pulsatile forces exerted by blood pressure. Alterations in these elastic fibers, such as fragmentation, thinning, and disorganization, compromise the aorta's ability to withstand these forces. - Fragmentation of elastic fibers increases the spaces between the lamellar layers (translamellar spaces), weakening the aorta's mechanical strength and elasticity. This renders the vessel more prone to dissection, as the weakened wall can't resist the high shear forces of blood flow very well. - Thinning these fibers further weakens the vessel wall, widening the spaces between elastic fibers and reducing the aorta's overall resilience. This makes the aorta susceptible to dilation, aneurysm formation, and dissection. - Disorganization refers to the loss of the parallel arrangement of elastic fibers, which are normally aligned in an orderly fashion to withstand pressure. When disorganized, the fibers are haphazardly arranged and unable to function
