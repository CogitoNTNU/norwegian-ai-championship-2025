to evaluate the metabolic status of various kidney disorders and accurately quantify GFR and proteinuria. For inpatients, nurses typically collect the urine and must ensure it remains free from contaminants. In outpatient settings, patients need proper education on how to collect the urine sample accurately. Precise collections can identify treatable abnormalities that predispose to nephrolithiasis, assist in diagnosing conditions such as pheochromocytoma, and provide accurate measurements for monitoring the progression of CKD. Effective communication among healthcare team members is paramount. Primary care clinicians and hospitalists often identify renal abnormalities first and may refer patients to pediatric or adult nephrologists. Patients with significant nephrolithiasis should be offered 24-hour urine testing for stone prophylaxis therapy and should be referred to urology. Clinicians and nurses must ensure that patients are fully informed about the procedures and requirements for 24-hour urine collection, with clear, written instructions provided to support patient understanding. Laboratory staff should ensure proper specimen handling and processing. Clear communication across the healthcare team facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment decisions, enabling a coordinated response and the effective use of clinical data. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=30861&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=30861) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/30861/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=30861) ## References 1.
