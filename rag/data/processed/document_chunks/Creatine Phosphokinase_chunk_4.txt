supplanted mainly by mass assays of CK-MB.[29] In contrast with immunoinhibition, which measures the CK-MB isoenzyme by determination of its catalytic activity, mass immunoassays measure CK-MB protein concentrations.[30] Several mass assays using various labels are now commercially available and used for routine CK-MB determination. Measurements use the “sandwich” technique, where the antibody specifically recognizes the MB dimer. The sandwich technique ensures that only CK-MB is estimated because neither CK-MM nor CK-BB reacts with both antibodies. Mass assays are more sensitive than activity-based methods, with a detection limit for CK-MB usually \<1 μg/L.[31] Other advantages include sample stability, noninterference with hemolysis, drugs, or other catalytic activity inhibitors, full automation, and fast turnaround time.[32] ## Interfering Factors A moderate degree of hemolysis (up to 0.32 g/dL of hemoglobin) does not significantly influence the measured CK activity because erythrocytes contain no CK activity.[33] However, severely hemolyzed specimens are unsatisfactory because enzymes and intermediates (AK, ATP, and glucose-6-phosphate) liberated from the erythrocytes may affect the lag phase and the side reactions in the assay system. Turbid and icteric samples can be analyzed; appropriate values are obtained if the starting absorbance is not too high.[34] ## Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings Serum CK activity is subject to physiological variations. Sex, age, muscle mass, physical activity, and race all interact to affect measured serum activity. Males generally have a larger muscle mass, correlating to higher serum CK activities than females. The racial type also affects CK activities; the mean activity in white individuals is 66% of the activity in black individuals.[34] In white subjects, the reference interval is 46 to 171 U/L for males and 34 to 145 U/L for females when measured with an assay traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) 37 C reference procedure. Newborns generally have higher CK activities resulting from skeletal muscle trauma during birth. Serum CK in infants decreases to the adult reference interval by 6 to 10 weeks. CK-BB may be elevated in neonates, particularly in newborns with brain-damaged or low birth weight.[35] The presence of CK-BB in blood, usually at low concentrations, may represent a physiological finding in the first days of life. The suggested upper reference limits when standardized methods for CK determination are employed are males up to 170 U/L and females up to 145 U/L. With the CK-MB mass assay, the upper reference limit for males is 5.0 μg/L, and
