mm Hg - Grade IV: IAP >25 mm Hg Intra-abdominal hypertension in the presence of organ dysfunction raises suspicion for ACS. Surgical procedures that carry an especially high risk of developing IAH include liver transplantation, damage control surgery, repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and large abdominal hernia repairs.[9] Other etiologies must be considered in addition to surgery as potential causes of ACS, which can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary ACS causes include blunt or penetrating trauma, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, abdominal adhesions, intestinal obstruction, tumor formation, and retroperitoneal hematoma. Secondary causes do not originate from intra-abdominal disease, including pregnancy, ascites, ileus, intra-abdominal sepsis, and large-volume fluid resuscitation.[10] Intra-abdominal pressures can be chronically elevated in pregnancy, cirrhosis, obesity, intra-abdominal malignancy, and peritoneal dialysis.[6][11][12][13] Those with higher body mass index can be expected to have higher baseline IAP between 9 to 14 mm Hg due to the restrictive effect of adipose tissue.[14] The causes of IAH and ACS can be broken down into the following categories:[15][16][17] **Diminished abdominal wall compliance:** abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal adhesions, major trauma, major burns, mechanical ventilation, obesity. **Increased intraluminal volume:** gastroparesis, gastric distension, ileus, constipation, toxic megacolon, volvulus. **Increased extraluminal abdominal volume:** hemoperitoneum, pneumoperitoneum, severe pancreatitis, liver failure with ascites, retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal tumors, intra-abdominal abscesses, laparoscopy with excessive insufflation pressures, peritoneal dialysis. **Capillary leak/fluid resuscitation:** damage control surgery, bacteremia, systemic inflammation, coagulopathy, sepsis, massive fluid administration, blood product transfusion. ## Epidemiology ACS can develop in all ICU and critically ill patients. The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Intra-Abdominal Hypertension in Critically Ill Patients (IROI Study) was a prospective study that revealed 34% of patients to have IAH on the day of admission, which increased to 48.9% within 14 days. The development of IAH within the observed period was associated with mortality.[18] In another identified series of mixed ICU populations, 32% of patients were found to have IAH and 4% to have ACS.[19] ## Pathophysiology Elevated intra-abdominal pressures can affect multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.[20][21] **Cardiovascular System** The cardiovascular system can be affected in multiple ways due to elevated IAP. IAH can cause compression of the inferior vena cava, reducing venous blood return to the heart and causing lower extremity edema. Decreased venous return can also lead to reduced cardiac output, resulting in less blood and oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Additionally, the increased IAP causes
