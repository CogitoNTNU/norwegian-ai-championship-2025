receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin.[5][11][19][20][22] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for disseminated intravascular coagulation includes: - Dysfibrinogenemia - Hemolytic uremic syndrome - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - Immune thrombocytopenia - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ## Pearls and Other Issues Disseminated intravascular coagulation can quickly lead to multiorgan failure and death, particularly if early recognition and treatment fail to occur. A high index of suspicion of this high-mortality disease in critically ill patients remains paramount to improving outcomes in patients with DIC. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of DIC are complex and challenging. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that could consist of a hematologist, surgeon, intensivist, infectious disease consultant, pathologist, and internist. The key is to address the underlying disorder that ultimately led to this condition developing. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and consideration for exploratory surgical intervention in trauma-related cases represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. Despite optimal treatment, DIC carries a very high mortality rate. Because DIC affects multiple organ systems, most survivors have a prolonged recovery period.[16][23] ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20610&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20610) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/blood-disorders/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=20610) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/20610/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=20610) ## References 1.
