the blood sample was taken from a site close to the area of the fracture, the incidence is closer to 95%. Fat embolism and FES can also occur intraoperatively while repairing a long bone fracture. A transesophageal echocardiogram detected fat embolism in nearly 41% of patients. Fat embolism has a higher incidence than FES. In the landmark study carried out by Gurd, using the established clinical criteria, an incidence of 19% of FES was reported in a group of trauma patients. Since early open reduction and internal fixation have become the standard of care for repairing fractures of long bones, the incidence of fat embolism and FES has gradually decreased. Most recent studies show an incidence of about 1% to 11%. ## Pathophysiology Fat particles or globules are released from the organs of primary origin and enter the microcirculation, causing damage to the capillary beds. The disruption affects the microcirculatory hemostasis in the brain, skin, eyes, and heart. Two main theories try to explain the development of FES: mechanical and biochemical. **Mechanical Theory** Gassling et al postulated that large fat droplets are released into the venous system. Elevation of the intramedullary from trauma or surgery leads to the release of fat into the venous sinusoids. From the venous system, these fat globules are deposited in the pulmonary capillary bed, where they travel to the brain via the arteriovenous shunt into the brain. Initially, there was no valid explanation for the development of FES in patients with no patent foramen ovale, but the presence of an arteriovenous shunt clarifies this. Also, intravascular fat droplets are deformable, hence their ability to transverse the pulmonary vasculature. The pathophysiological changes produced by fat droplets include the following: - Elevated pulmonary artery pressure - Impairment of oxygen exchange from ventilation-perfusion mismatch - Systemic effects on end-organisms such as the brain, kidney, and skin. The deposition of fat droplets in the brain produces a cascade of reactions. Disruption of microcirculation leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, local inflammation, and ischemia. The release of inflammatory mediators and vasoactive amines like histamine and serotonin increases vascular permeability and vasodilation, with ensuing hypotension and hypoperfusion. **Biochemical Theory** Baker et al proposed this theory for the development of FES. According to this theory, the precipitating event, whether traumatic or nontraumatic, triggers a hormonal change in the body system. This leads to the release of free fatty acid (FFA) and chylomicrons.
