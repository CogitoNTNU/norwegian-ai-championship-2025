Allergen and environmental control are very important in asthmatics as well. The primary factor in the environmental control program is the avoidance of dust mites. Sensitivity to dust mites is a strong predictor of asthma and asthma severity. When controlling exposure to dust mites, it is recommended to encase mattresses and pillows in vinyl covers and wash all bedding every 1 to 2 weeks in hot water. Other measures include reducing humidity, removing carpets from bedrooms, and limiting lying on upholstered furniture. In rooms of children stuffed animals should be washed or removed from beds. If unable to remove rugs, using a HEPA filter will reduce allergen emissions. Wearing a mask while using a regular vacuum helps as well. Pets especially cats can also be a potential trigger for asthma and allergies and typically should be removed from the house. High exposure to cockroach allergen has been associated with the risk of asthma and the highest concentration in the kitchen. Allergy to fungus is a risk factor for asthma. When there are high spore counts in your location s person with asthma and allergies should avoid prolonged outdoor activity. Tobacco exposure should be avoided as it has been shown to increase medication requirements and also decrease lung function. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with increases in child risk of developing asthma. Air pollution can also contribute to exacerbating asthma as well. **Management of Acute Exacerbations** 1. Correcting severe hypoxemia through the application of oxygen and repetitive treatment with short-acting beta2 agonists 1. Rapid reversal of airflow obstruction 1. Reduction of the risk of relapse 1. \_**Anyone with peak expiratory flow below 50% needs immediate medical care.** \_ **Medications** - Combination of inhaled anticholinergic and beta2 agonist which have been shown to decrease hospitalization of school-aged children - Intravenous magnesium sulfate has also been shown to increase lung function and decrease hospitalization in children - Administering systemic corticosteroids within one hour of an emergency room or urgent care presentation has a significant effect on patients with severe exacerbation and also decreases hospitalization - Patients should be sent home on oral prednisone after an acute hospitalization [4] ## Differential Diagnosis Making sure a patient has asthma and not another condition is an essential step before initiating treatment. **Adults** - Chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) - Congestive heart failure - gastroesophageal reflux disease - mechanical obstruction of airways - vocal cord
