TEE evaluation and prevent any accidental patient movement, which could have severe consequences. Before commencing the TEER procedure, preoperative TEE should be conducted to thoroughly assess the mitral valve lesion and evaluate the feasibility of repair. In some cases, it may be necessary to obtain other forms of cardiac imaging performed by a trained cardiovascular interventionalist or cardiovascular imaging specialist. Additionally, a preoperative anesthetic evaluation is essential to optimize patients for general anesthesia, ensuring their safety and comfort throughout the procedure. Collaboration among the structural heart team, which comprises key members, including the interventional cardiologist, cardiac anesthesiologist, operating room personnel, and nursing staff, is crucial for the procedure's success. Adequate preparation, including readily available equipment and devices, is paramount. Conducting a preprocedure time-out is recommended to ensure effective communication within the team and confirm that all necessary components are in place. Sterility is a critical aspect of preparation for any medical procedure, and this is no exception. Before the procedure, a sterile field is established. The catheter insertion site is thoroughly sterilized in line with standard catheterization protocols. All personnel near the sterile field should follow strict sterile techniques, including scrubbing and wearing full gowns, hats, masks, and gloves. The procedure area should be cleaned and appropriately draped before commencement to maintain a sterile environment and ensure patient safety.[55] **Device Selection** When using 3DE, it is crucial to carefully assess the underlying etiology, baseline mitral valve area, mean transmitral gradient, and anatomical complexity before selecting the appropriate device. The primary criteria to be considered when choosing a device are shown below (see **Table 6.** Mitral Valve Criteria for Device Selection).

Mitral Valve Criteria for Device Selection. The accurate quantification of the mitral valve area, MVA, ideally involves multiplanar reconstruction using high-resolution 3D volumes of the mitral valve. When deploying a PASCAL P10 device, the MVA has been observed to be reduced by approximately 47%. However, using rigid implants with extended arms (XTW/XT) is expected to impact the baseline MVA substantially. Specifically, the MVA reduction achieved with the NTR and XTR implants was 52% and 57%, respectively.[56] It's important to note that the extent of MVA reduction depends on the precise location of the device along the line of coaptation, with the A2/P2 position experiencing the most significant reduction and commissural placement resulting in the least reduction.[56] Two pivotal factors influencing the selection of
