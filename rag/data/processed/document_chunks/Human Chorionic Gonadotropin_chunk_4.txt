also following the termination of normal or ectopic pregnancies to assure that the therapy has been successful. Notably, many different combinations of antibodies are used in commercial assays. This variety yields heterogeneous results, with a 50-fold difference in immunoassay results.[4] This potential disparity is clinically relevant, particularly when comparing results from different laboratories in different facilities or hospitals when examining low values following pregnancy termination or trophoblastic disease. **Gestational Trophoblastic Disease** Detection of hCG is also helpful in evaluating trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform moles, postmolar tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. All these entities produce hCG, varying levels of which are reported on commercial assays. For example, a total hCG level >100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole, although many normal pregnancies may reach this level at their peak around weeks 8 to 11 of gestation.[26] Precise hCG measurements are crucial for assessing the tumor mass, determining the success of malignancy treatment, and detecting disease recurrence or persistence.[7] **Nonpregnant Patients** hCG in the serum increases with age in nonpregnant women. A cutoff value of 14 mIU/mL has been suggested for use in interpreting results in women older than 55. In all nonpregnant patients, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, or other malignancies should be considered as potential sources of positive hCG results.[27] hCG levels can also help determine prognosis in these cases, with higher levels associated with a poor prognosis in testicular cancers.[28] ## Quality Control and Lab Safety Quality control and laboratory safety are integral to the accuracy and reliability of hCG testing. The routine use of control materials is crucial for monitoring assay performance, identifying analytical errors, and ensuring the consistency of results. Strict adherence to biosafety protocols, proper specimen handling, and regular maintenance of instrumentation are critical for minimizing contamination risks and maintaining a safe working environment. Furthermore, compliance with established laboratory standards and regulatory guidelines supports diagnostic accuracy and improves clinical outcomes. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Effective patient-centered care involving hCG testing and interpretation requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach grounded in strong clinical skills, strategic planning, ethical integrity, and seamless communication. Clinicians and advanced practitioners must possess the diagnostic acumen to interpret hCG levels within the appropriate clinical context, whether to confirm pregnancy, monitor gestational complications, or identify malignancies. Nurses play a vital role in specimen collection, patient education, and
