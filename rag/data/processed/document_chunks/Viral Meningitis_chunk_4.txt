old and the immunocompromised - Ceftriaxone IV and - Vancomycin IV and - Ampicillin IV Meningitis associated with a foreign body (post-procedure, penetrating trauma) - Cefepime IV or ceftazidime IV or meropenem IV and - Vancomycin IV Meningitis with severe penicillin allergy - Moxifloxacin IV and - Vancomycin IV Fungal (Cryptococcal) meningitis - Amphotericin B IV and - Flucytosine by mouth **Antibiotics** Ceftriaxone - Third-generation cephalosporin - Gram-negative coverage - Very effective against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Neisseria meningitidis_ - Better CNS penetration than piperacillin-tazobactam (typically used in gram-negative sepsis coverage) Vancomycin - Gram-positive coverage (MRSA) - Also used for resistant pneumococcus Ampicillin - Listeria coverage (gram-positive bacilli) Cefepime - Fourth-generation cephalosporin - Increased activity against pseudomonas Cefotaxime - Third-generation cephalosporin - Equivalent to ceftriaxone - Safe for neonates **Steroid Therapy** There is insufficient evidence to support the widespread use of steroids in bacterial meningitis. Some studies report a reduction in mortality for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis, but not in _Haemophilus influenzae_ or _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis. In children, steroids were associated with a reduction of severe hearing impairment only in cases of _Haemophilus influenzae_ meningitis. [16] **Increased Intracranial Pressure** If the patient develops clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (altered mental status, neurologic deficits, non-reactive pupils, bradycardia), interventions to maintain cerebral perfusion include: - Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees - Inducing mild hyperventilation in the intubated patient - Osmotic diuretics such as 25% mannitol or 3% saline **Chemoprophylaxis** Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for close contacts of a patient diagnosed with _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ type B meningitis. Close contacts include housemates, significant others, those who have shared utensils, and health care providers in proximity to secretions (providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubating without a facemask). Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for _N. meningitidis_ includes rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, and for _H. influenzae_ type B: rifampin. ## Differential Diagnosis - Stroke - Subdural hematoma - Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Metastatic brain disease - Brain abscess (might coexist with meningitis) ## Prognosis Outcomes depend on patient characteristics such as age and immune status, but also vary depending on the etiologic organism. In the United States, for overall bacterial meningitis, the annual case fatality rate in 2010 was 14.3%. Pathogen-specific mortality:[6] - _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 17.9% - _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 10.1% - Group B _Streptococcus_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 11.1% - _H._ i _nfluenzae_ meningitis: case fatality rate, 7% - _Listeria
