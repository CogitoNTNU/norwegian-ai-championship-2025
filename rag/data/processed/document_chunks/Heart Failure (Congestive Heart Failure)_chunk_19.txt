a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating an interprofessional approach to optimize patient-centered care and outcomes. Physicians, including clinical cardiologists, interventionalists, electrophysiologists, HF specialists, and cardiac imaging specialists, collaborate to diagnose, manage, and treat HF using evidence-based medical and procedural interventions. Advanced practitioners, such as HF nurse practitioners, play a crucial role in ongoing patient assessment, medication titration, and patient education to improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy. Specialty-trained HF nurses are vital in educating patients on lifestyle modifications, symptom recognition, and weight management to prevent exacerbations and reduce hospital admissions. Physical therapists help improve functional capacity and promote safe activity levels, while HF-trained social workers and case managers assess patients in community settings or through home visits to facilitate adherence to care plans and address social determinants of health that may impact disease management. Effective interprofessional communication and care coordination are essential to enhancing patient safety, team performance, and long-term outcomes in HF management. Structured communication strategies, such as interdisciplinary rounds and shared electronic health records, ensure seamless information exchange among clinicians. Clinical pharmacists work closely with physicians and nurses to review patient medication lists, optimize pharmacologic therapy, and prevent adverse drug-drug interactions, thereby improving medication safety. Collaboration between primary care clinicians and cardiologists helps ensure continuity of care, minimize adverse effects of medical therapy, and slow disease progression. A well-coordinated, team-based approach significantly improves the quality of life for HF patients by integrating medical, pharmacologic, and lifestyle interventions while reducing hospitalizations and mortality. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22661&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22661) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/congestive-heart-failure-chf/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22661) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22661/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22661) [![Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph](/books/NBK430873/bin/cHF.gif)](/books/NBK430873/figure/article-22661.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK430873/figure/article-22661.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph.
