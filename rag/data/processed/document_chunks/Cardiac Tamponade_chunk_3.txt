include right ventricular collapse or bowing of the intraventricular septum. If myocarditis is of concern, computed tomography or cardiovascular magnetic MRI should be done. ## Treatment / Management Acute pericarditis often responds to treating the underlying cause. High-dose NSAIDs, with or without colchicine, tapered down over weeks is the first-line treatment. High-dose aspirin (ASA) should be used in the post-myocardial infarction Dressler syndrome. The response is often assessed clinically based on symptom relief. Corticosteroids are not recommended as first-line therapy in most patients as they can increase the risk of recurrent pericarditis. For patients on the corticosteroid for recurrent pericarditis, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin) may be considered.[7] The treatment of cardiac tamponade is pericardiocentesis. During this procedure, a needle is advanced through the chest wall into the pericardium. The procedure may be done blindly or with guidance from ultrasonography or fluoroscopy. Hemodynamically unstable patients warrant the use of pericardiocentesis without imaging. Surgical drainage is required if the heart cannot be reached by a needle, clotted hemopericardium, intrapericardial bleeding, or thoracic conditions that make needle drainage difficult or ineffective.[8]. Definitive treatment to prevent further occurrence is achieved with a pericardial window, a surgical procedure performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon. ## Differential Diagnosis The differential of cardiac tamponade would include other causes of obstructive or cardiogenic shock such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, Type A aortic dissection with extension into the pericardium or tension pneumothorax. In addition to the underlying causes of pericarditis discussed above, other causes of chest pain that should be considered when evaluating for pericarditis would include acute coronary syndrome, angina, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis or esophagitis. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses also play a vital role in managing patients with acute pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. Their role includes medication adjustment and follow-up at the pericardial clinic. They not only co-manage patients with the physicians by monitoring patientsâ€™ symptoms and inflammatory markers but also help in contacting patients by phone, titrating dosages of medications, and arranging follow-up visits with an NP/PA in 3 months and with the physician every 6 months. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26956&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26956) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/heart-health/acute-cardiac-tamponade/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26956) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26956/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26956) [![Figure Icon](/corehtml/pmc/css/bookshelf/2.26/img/media-icon.gif)](/books/NBK534806/figure/article-26956.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK534806/figure/article-26956.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Large Pericardial Effusion.
