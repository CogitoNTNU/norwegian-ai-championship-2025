injection site. Other adverse effects of injectable calcitonin include pruritus, tingling of the palms and soles, and increased diuresis. The nasal spray formulation can lead to epistaxis, rhinitis, and ulceration of the nasal mucosa. As a result, it is essential to thoroughly examine the nasal mucosa, turbinates, and septum before initiating the therapy, whenever the patient reports nasal symptoms during the therapy, and periodically during the treatment procedure. The incidence of adverse nasal events increases with the patient's age. If nasal ulceration exceeds a diameter of 1.5 mm, the suggested course of action is to discontinue using the nasal formulation. Nausea may also arise from intranasal calcitonin use, although its occurrence is less frequent when compared to parenteral administration.[28] **Drug-Drug Interactions** Medications that may interact with calcitonin include etelcalcetide, foscarnet, lithium, sincalide, and zoledronic acid. These medications can impact patients' calcium levels or kidney function using calcitonin. Such interactions may increase the risk of adverse effects or diminish the efficacy of calcitonin treatment. ## Contraindications Hypersensitivity: Calcitonin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to the drug or its components. Hypersensitivity reactions can manifest as mild skin responses or escalate to severe anaphylaxis. **Box Warning** The FDA has not issued any specific Box Warnings for calcitonin. Notably, drug safety information can evolve over time. **Precautions** Hypocalcemia: Calcitonin can decrease serum calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption, leading to adverse effects such as tetany, muscle cramps, and cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, hypocalcemia must be rectified before initiating calcitonin treatment in patients, and monitoring is also recommended throughout the therapy. In addition, to address this concern, patients should be provided with supplementary calcium at 1000 mg/d and vitamin D at 400 IU/d. ## Monitoring Patients receiving calcitonin should be monitored for indications of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and for the potential occurrence of hypocalcemia. ## Toxicity A weak association is observed between the extended usage of intranasal calcitonin and an increased incidence of cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 21 randomized, controlled clinical trials unveiled a higher occurrence of malignancy in individuals treated with calcitonin (4.1%) compared to those administered a placebo (2.9%).[1][29] Animal studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of pituitary hyperplasia and adenomas with high calcitonin dosages. However, preclinical investigations involving the overexpression of salmon calcitonin in transgenic mice have not provided any indication of the molecule acting as a carcinogen.[30] Calcitonin has also demonstrated
