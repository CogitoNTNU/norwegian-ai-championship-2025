overload, which is a significant cause of mortality in severe pulmonary embolism cases. Obstruction of over 30% to 50% of the pulmonary arterial bed's cross-sectional area leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure.[6] Pulmonary embolism-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by thromboxane A2 and serotonin release, increases pulmonary vascular resistance and decreases arterial compliance.[7] The resultant right ventricular dilation alters the myocardium's contractile properties, increasing wall tension and myocyte stretch, prolonging right ventricular contraction time, and triggering compensatory neurohumoral activation for inotropic and chronotropic stimulation. However, the right ventricles' limited capacity to sustain high pulmonary artery pressure can lead to hemodynamic instability. Excessive neurohumoral activation, potentially causing myocarditis, and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can further damage the right ventricular myocardium.[8] Respiratory failure in pulmonary embolism primarily arises from hemodynamic disturbances leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Additionally, there is the potential for right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale, which exacerbates hypoxemia and increases the risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke.[9] ## Indications Meticulous patient selection remains the cornerstone of endovascular strategies in pulmonary embolism management. Three critical considerations guide the decision to proceed with CDT: 1. Disease severity and acuity: 1. Massive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis is the primary choice, offering lower all-cause mortality.[10] In cases where systemic thrombolysis fails, endovascular approaches, including CDT, become potential options within a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) approach, considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and surgical embolectomy for life-saving situations.[11][12] 1. Submassive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis provides a mortality benefit but raises major bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage.[10][13]. American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association guidelines consider CDT for deterioration or when adverse prognosis indicators are present. The European Society of Cardiology advocates 2-step risk stratification with validated tools like the pulmonary embolism Severity Index followed by imaging and biomarker assessment.[3][14] If both clinical and objective assessments indicate high risk and impending cardiopulmonary deterioration is likely, CDT may be considered. This reflects the ongoing need for robust randomized trials. Existing data on ultrasound-assisted CDT shows promise; exceeding heparin alone improves right ventricular size within 24 hours without major bleeding or recurrent venous thromboembolism.[15] 1. Low-risk pulmonary embolism: Endovascular interventions are generally contraindicated due to low morbidity and mortality. The exception might be large saddle emboli without hemodynamic or right ventricular issues. Ongoing trials on optimal dosing and duration are underway.[16] 1. Major adverse bleeding risk: Balancing potential CDT benefits with individual bleeding risks is crucial.
