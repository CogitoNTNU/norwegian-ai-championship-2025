This condition is most frequently caused by postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, tumors, or less common conditions like volvulus, gallstone ileus, or endometriosis. SBO presents with hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and obstipation. The pathophysiology includes bowel distension, impaired venous return, mucosal ischemia, bacterial translocation, and, in severe cases, necrosis, perforation, and peritonitis. Diagnosis involves clinical assessment and imaging, with computed tomography being the gold standard to identify the transition point, ischemia, or perforation. Initial management includes fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and nasogastric decompression, with surgery indicated for strangulation, ischemia, or unresolved obstruction. Clinicians participating in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of SBO. The course emphasizes the importance of early recognition of complications like ischemia and strangulation and highlights evidence-based protocols for nonoperative and surgical management. This recognition enhances clinician's diagnostic accuracy and decision-making skills, equipping them with the tools to improve patient outcomes in this complex and potentially life-threatening condition. **Objectives:** - Apply current imaging modalities and strategize a management plan for optimal timing of exploratory surgical procedures to detect the etiology of small bowel obstruction. - Implement evidence-based guidelines for a safe initial nonoperative phase of management while monitoring patients for resolution or worsening to prevent complications of small bowel obstruction. - Differentiate between mechanical and functional causes of small bowel obstruction using clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. - Communicate interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate rapid diagnosis and management options for patients with small bowel obstruction.

This condition is characterized by the triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension, reflecting the disruption of normal intestinal flow. SBO can be broadly categorized into simple obstructions, which involve mechanical blockage without
