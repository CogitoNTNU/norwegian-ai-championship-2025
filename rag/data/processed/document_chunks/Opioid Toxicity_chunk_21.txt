and overdose-related deaths, much attention has focused on this so-called "opioid epidemic." All healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners who prescribe controlled substances, have a role in reducing the opioid epidemic and should be equipped to identify and treat those experiencing toxicity and overdose. New research focuses on finding effective interventions and identifying risk factors for overdose. Some of these efforts include treatment programs, take-home intranasal naloxone, and monitored injection facilities. A review of research exploring overdose education and naloxone distribution suggests reduced fatality rates for patients who receive counseling and prescriptions for home naloxone. Naloxone has been shown to have a very safe side effect profile. Several studies on opiate-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, acute opioid withdrawal symptoms may develop when this agent is administered to opioid-tolerant patients. Individuals given naloxone in the setting of opioid overdose may experience sudden withdrawal syndrome, manifesting as aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting also occur in about 30% of patients. Most symptoms are not severe or sustained, and less than 1% of patients require admission. Acute withdrawal symptoms are more likely with larger doses of naloxone. Despite the risk of precipitated withdrawal, naloxone should not be withheld in cases of acute opioid overdose with respiratory depression.[43][44] An interprofessional approach should involve physicians, nurses, and substance abuse counselors. The goal of the collaborative efforts of this group is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with OUD. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=26226&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=26226) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/addiction/opioid-overdose/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=26226) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/26226/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=26226) ## References 1.
