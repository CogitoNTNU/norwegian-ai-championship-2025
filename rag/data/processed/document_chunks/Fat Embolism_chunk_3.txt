vasodilation, with ensuing hypotension and hypoperfusion. **Biochemical Theory** Baker et al proposed this theory for the development of FES. According to this theory, the precipitating event, whether traumatic or nontraumatic, triggers a hormonal change in the body system. This leads to the release of free fatty acid (FFA) and chylomicrons. The presence of acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, causes the chylomicron to coalesce and migrate. Baker et al attribute the development of FES to FFA. Pneumocyte hydrolysis of fat particles generates FFA, which migrates to other organs, causing multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. The biochemical theory helps to explain the development of FES in nontraumatic patients. ## Histopathology The pathogenesis of FES is poorly understood, and evaluation of the progression of histopathological changes in patients is not very practical. Animal model studies included injecting Tirolean, a form of fat found in bone marrow, into the caudal veins of rats and monitoring changes in the lungs over an 11-day period. The subsequent histopathological examination of the lung tissues included staining for the smooth muscle's fat, collagen, and actin. The most notable change was a decrease in the patency of the arteries and arterioles over the first 96 hours. Still, there was a return to normal patency towards the end of the observation period, the 11th day. There was also significant inflammation and fibrosis around the blood vessels. These changes were noticeable within the first couple of hours of infusion and persisted for the time frame for which the study was conducted. Although the results of a rat model give insight into the changes that can occur in patients with fat embolism or FES. ## History and Physical A fat embolism can travel to most of the body's organs. Fat embolism and FES are multiorgan diseases that can damage the kidneys, heart, skin, brain, and lungs. Fat embolism typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult. **History** The history should elicit the time and onset of symptoms. Also, since most cases of fat embolism and FES are related to orthopedic trauma, the time and mechanism of the trauma and intraoperative maneuvers should be noted in the history. Sickle cell disease and other forms of hemoglobinopathy can precipitate FES. Patients should be asked about the history of sickle cell disease in family members and any complications of sickle cell disease like acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises, or avascular necrosis of
