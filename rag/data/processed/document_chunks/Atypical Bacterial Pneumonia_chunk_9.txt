addition of clarithromycin or azithromycin can be considered for atypical bacteria in children if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours.[70] Macrolides are recommended for children older than 5 for 10 days.[77] Children who develop severe disease require parenteral therapy, which may include amoxicillin/clavulanate in addition to macrolides. In certain cases, fluoroquinolones may be an alternative, along with oxygen supplementation.[78] Older patients with atypical pneumonia often have altered mental signs and underlying comorbidities, which increase their risk for aspiration. In these cases, anaerobic coverage should be considered. Broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial options include amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, or meropenem. Alternatively, metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) can be added to regimens that lack anaerobic coverage.[64] **Criteria for Admission** - Respiration rate ≥30 breaths/min - Oxygen saturation ≤90% on room air - Hypotension, systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≤60 mm Hg - New altered mental status/delirium - Aged 65 or older with the above factors [68][69][80][81] ## Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for atypical bacterial pneumonia is similar to that for bacterial pneumonia and typically spans the cardiac, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems. From the cardiac system, pericarditis and myocarditis can present in the setting of viral symptoms and should be considered. Within the respiratory system, distinguishing between the upper and lower respiratory tracts is essential. The upper respiratory system includes pharyngitis, sinusitis, and more emergent conditions such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. For the lower respiratory tract, a chest x-ray and CT differentiate bronchitis/bronchiolitis from pneumonia. The diagnosis becomes more complex when an abnormal infiltrate is detected on imaging; in such cases, it is crucial to distinguish between atypical/viral/bacterial pneumonia, polymicrobial aspiration, and sterile chemical pneumonitis. Other non-infectious respiratory mimics include asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[9] Lastly, it is essential to consider musculoskeletal complaints such as costochondritis and rib dysfunction; however, they frequently lack constitutional symptoms. ## Prognosis The majority of patients with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia can be successfully treated on an outpatient basis. There is typically a complete resolution of symptoms and a low morbidity and mortality. Treatment is often uneventful in the absence of significant comorbid conditions, vital sign abnormalities, and a toxic appearance. As with all clinical diseases, not every case follows the expected course. Close follow-up and adherence with management strategies are necessary to monitor for disease progression. A smaller proportion of patients may require hospitalization due to disease progression, as indicated by the
