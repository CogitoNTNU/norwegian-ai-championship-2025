etc) for tularemia pneumonia ## Pathophysiology Pathogens initially colonize the pharynx, followed by micro-aspiration, which is the mechanism of entry into the lower respiratory tract. Once there, the pathogen induces the host's pulmonary defense. If there is a defect in the host's defense or it is overcome by high inoculum or virulence of the pathogen, then pneumonia will result. Pathogens may also spread through the hematogenous route and macro-aspiration. ## History and Physical Common symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough productive of purulent sputum, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and weight loss. Patients with alcohol use disorder and those who are immune-compromised may have an absence of fever and less evident or systemic symptoms such as weakness, lethargy, altered mental status, dyspepsia, or other upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The presence of some symptoms may provide etiological clues. For example, diarrhea, headache, and confusion (related to hyponatremia) can indicate _Legionella_ infection; otitis media, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or anemia with jaundice (hemolytic anemia) may indicate _Mycoplasma_ infection _._ Pneumonia can provoke acute decompensation of an underlying chronic illness, such as congestive heart failure, and can confound the initial presentation of pneumonia and result in delays in diagnosis and treatment. ## Evaluation Initial workup for pneumonia will include imaging and blood work (see **Images.** Lung Abscess, Computed Tomography Scan and Bilateral Pneumonia,\*\*\*\* Computed Tomography Scan and Lung Pneumonia with Fibrosis). A chest x-ray will be needed to identify an infiltrate or effusion, which, if present, will improve diagnostic accuracy (see **Image.** Healthy Lung and Q Fever Pneumatic Lung, Chest X-ray). Bloodwork should include a complete blood count with differentials; serum electrolytes with renal and liver function tests help confirm evidence of inflammation and assess severity. Influenza testing is recommended during the winter season. Testing for respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal swabs by molecular methods can be considered if available. Tools such as CURB 65 (confusion, urea greater than or equal to 20 mg/dL, respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30/min, blood pressure systolic less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic less than 60 mm Hg), and Pneumonia Severity Index for severity assessment may assist in determining the treatment setting, such as outpatient versus inpatient. Still, accuracy is limited when used alone or without practical clinical judgment. In hospitalized patients, blood and sputum cultures should be collected, preferably before the institution of antimicrobial therapy, but without delay in treatment. If cultures are negative, urine collection and
