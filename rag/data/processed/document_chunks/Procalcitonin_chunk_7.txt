Although animal studies have not indicated any fetal harm, the data from human studies is insufficient to establish the drug's safety for use in pregnancy. Breastfeeding considerations: The available data on the effects of calcitonin on nursing infants are limited. Consequently, even the nasal spray option of calcitonin is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers due to insufficient information. Pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of calcitonin in pediatric populations have not been confirmed. Limited data exist regarding the use of calcitonin in children. Calcitonin could potentially disrupt bone growth and development in children and adolescents. Consequently, this drug is not approved or recommended for pediatric patients. Older patients: No dosage adjustment is necessary for older patients based solely on their age. However, older individuals might be more sensitive to the effects of calcitonin and could encounter increased adverse reactions, such as hypocalcemia, nausea, and flushing. ## Adverse Effects Patients with allergies to fish products may be at an increased risk of experiencing hypersensitivity reactions when using salmon calcitonin. The hypersensitivity reactions observed in patients include bronchospasm, tongue swelling, and anaphylactic shock. Patients who were administered salmon calcitonin reported isolated instances of maculopapular rashes and urticaria. A skin allergy test is advisable for individuals predisposed to atopy before administering the drug. In cases of such reactions, epinephrine injection serves as the rescue therapy.[27] Clinicians should exercise particular caution when treating patients with bipolar disorder, as calcitonin can potentially lower serum lithium levels. Animal studies indicate that administering calcitonin during pregnancy could reduce fetal weight. Although data from human studies do not align with this finding, it might still be advisable to exercise additional caution when considering calcitonin therapy during pregnancy.[27] The prevalent adverse effects associated with parenterally administered calcitonin pertain to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Approximately 10% of patients encountering this route of administration may experience mild nausea, which subsides as the therapy progresses. Other GI adverse effects include reduced appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and discomfort. Injectable calcitonin can cause flushing of the face, hands, and feet several minutes after administration. Moreover, a localized inflammatory reaction might also occur at the injection site. Other adverse effects of injectable calcitonin include pruritus, tingling of the palms and soles, and increased diuresis. The nasal spray formulation can lead to epistaxis, rhinitis, and ulceration of the nasal mucosa. As a result, it is essential to thoroughly examine the nasal mucosa, turbinates, and septum before
