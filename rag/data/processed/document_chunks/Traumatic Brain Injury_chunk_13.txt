Recurrent brain trauma may put patients at risk of lifelong symptoms, and there may be cumulative and permanent effects. In patients who have already experienced an injury, posttrauma recovery is a challenging process of physical, mental, and emotional recovery. Neurologic and psychiatric complications are common. Suicide prevention in patients who have experienced brain trauma is also important, and patients should always be encouraged to seek help. ## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes An interprofessional team is crucial to successful treatment and rehabilitation of patients who have experienced traumatic brain injuries. Case managers or social workers can provide information regarding resources, coordinate appointments, assist with discharge planning, and work with insurance so that the patient may receive the care they need. Occupational therapists help in improving functional status and focus on activities of daily living, which may suffer severe limitations due to traumatic brain injuries; they may recommend alterations to the home to improve functional capacity. Physical therapists may recover strength, endurance, and coordination; they may also recommend using assistive devices and provide training on how to use them. Speech-language pathologists may evaluate and treat communication and swallowing difficulties. The nursing staff is vital at every stage, from providing intensive monitoring and total medical care in an acute setting to educating patients in the longer term. Physiatrists may oversee the rehabilitation team and determine if a patient is appropriate for intensive rehabilitation programs. Primary care providers are essential in long-term follow-up and coordinating care in patients with brain trauma. Neurologists diagnose and treat conditions of the nervous system and may coordinate the care of brain trauma and long-term sequelae. Neurosurgeons determine the need for surgical intervention and perform such interventions as indicated. Neuropsychologists may conduct more extensive cognitive testing and aid in assessing the patient's ability to manage their financial, legal, and medical decisions. If any pharmaceutical therapy plays a role in management, pharmacists are vital to evaluating dosing, drug interactions, and counsel regarding potential adverse effects. A coordinated interprofessional team effort is essential in the diagnosis and management of brain trauma injuries, and only through this approach can patient outcomes achieve their optimal results. ## Review Questions - [Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22607&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22607) - [Click here for a simplified version.](https://mdsearchlight.com/neurology/closed-head-trauma/?utm_source=pubmedlink&utm_campaign=MDS&utm_content=22607) - [Comment on this article.](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/commentarticle/22607/?utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=comments&utm_content=22607) [![Image ](/books/NBK557861/bin/avm.gif)](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f1/?report=objectonly "Figure") #### [Figure](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f1/?report=objectonly) Head CT, Intraventricular and Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage From Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) Contributed by Scott Dulebohn, MD [![Image ](/books/NBK557861/bin/SDH__tentorium.gif)](/books/NBK557861/figure/article-22607.image.f2/?report=objectonly "Figure")
