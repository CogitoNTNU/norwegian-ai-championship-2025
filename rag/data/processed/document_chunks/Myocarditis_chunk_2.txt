_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. - Parasites: Notable parasitic causes include _Trichinella spiralis_ (trichinosis) and _Schistosoma_ species (schistosomiasis). - Protozoa: The important protozoan pathogens include _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (the causative agent of Chagas disease) and _Toxoplasma gondii._ - Spirochetes: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , the causative agent of Lyme disease, can also lead to myocarditis. **Noninfectious Causes of Acute Myocarditis** Noninfectious causes of acute myocarditis encompass a broad spectrum of conditions and exposures. These include eosinophilic myocarditis and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Cardiotoxic drugs are also well-recognized contributors. Other noninfectious etiologies include systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and giant cell arteritis. Additional causes include acute rheumatic fever, exposure to venoms or chemicals (eg, hydrocarbons), and cellular rejection following cardiac transplantation.[9] ## Epidemiology The true prevalence of acute myocarditis remains uncertain due to its variable clinical presentation and the challenges associated with diagnosis. The condition is frequently underdiagnosed, complicating efforts to determine its exact incidence and prevalence. Acute myocarditis occurs more commonly in younger adults and affects individuals across all sexes and racial groups. However, notable regional variations in incidence have been reported.[10][11] According to the Global Burden of Disease Report (2019), the estimated incidence of acute myocarditis is approximately 6.1 cases per 100,000 individuals.[12] Other sources suggest a broader incidence range, from 10 to 22 cases per 100,000 population. In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million cases were reported globally.[13] Additionally, myocardial involvement is estimated to occur in up to 5% of patients with an acute viral illness. Among individuals presenting with angina-like chest pain, mildly elevated troponin I levels, and no evidence of CAD, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has identified myocarditis in approximately 13% of cases.[14] ## Pathophysiology Acute myocarditis is classified as an inflammatory cardiomyopathy. A triphasic model has been proposed to describe the pathophysiology of acute myocarditis. - Phase I involves direct myocardial injury caused by infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites), toxins, drugs, or autoimmune mechanisms. - Phase II involves an immune-mediated response characterized by cytokine release, cellular infiltration, molecular mimicry, production of antimyocyte antibodies, and a T-cell response targeting cardiac self-antigens. - Phase III represents either resolution or progression to chronic disease. Potential outcomes include complete resolution with full recovery, chronic inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyopathy, or progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.[7] Autoimmunity has a significant role in inflammatory myocarditis.[15] Autoantibodies against the cardiac myosin chain are detected in more than half of cases
