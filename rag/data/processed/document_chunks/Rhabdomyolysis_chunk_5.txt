There is a large variation in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with rhabdomyolysis; AKI is inconsistently defined, and the degree of rhabdomyolysis is highly variable.[36] Rhabdomyolysis can occur at any age, but most cases are seen in adults. Men, Black individuals, patients older than 60 years, and individuals with obesity are at increased risk. The most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in children is infection (30%). The incidence of crush syndrome is between 30% to 50% with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Children are at low risk for crush syndrome and have lower mortality rates compared to adults. Crush injury-related AKI and dialysis requirements varied across multiple studies. During natural disasters like earthquakes, early fluid resuscitation, extrication, and immediate hospitalization with a multidisciplinary team approach reduce AKI, morbidity, and mortality. In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the National Heart-Lung and Blood Institute, and the American Heart Association jointly released a clinical advisory. It defined statin-associated rhabdomyolysis as muscle symptoms with increased creatine kinase, typically more than 11 times the upper limit of normal (myonecrosis) with elevated serum creatinine consistent with pigment-induced nephropathy and myoglobinuria.[37] About 0.5% of patients taking statins might develop clinically significant myonecrosis.[38] The incidence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to immobilization, alcohol intoxication, fractures, strenuous muscle exercises, and insect bites is imprecise, as these are more sporadic incidents. ## Pathophysiology There are multiple causes for rhabdomyolysis, but the final common pathogenic pathway is direct myocyte injury or energy supply failure in the muscle cell.[39] The sodium-potassium pump and sodium-calcium exchanger on the sarcoplasmic membrane maintain low intracellular/sarcoplasmic sodium and calcium and high potassium concentrations in the resting muscle. At rest, calcium is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Muscle contraction is an active process using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and calcium. Any insult that disrupts the ATP, ion channels, and plasma membrane results in a loss of intracellular electrolyte equilibrium. Muscle injury (trauma, exercise, thermal dependent syndromes) or lack of myocyte intracellular ATP (medicines, electrolytes, hereditary and metabolic disorders, intense exercise, ischemia) results in intracellular sodium and calcium influx. Water is drawn into the cell along with sodium, causing cellular swelling and disruption of intracellular and membraneous structures. Excessive intracellular calcium leads to activation of actin-myosin
