Pleural effusions can arise from various etiologies, ranging from heart failure and pneumonia to malignancies, such as lung cancer, and systemic inflammatory disorders, such as lupus. Fluid accumulation in the pleural space can compress the lungs, impairing their ability to expand fully during inspiration and causing respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Pleural effusion is a marker of increased mortality and morbidity in specific populations. Diagnosing pleural effusion typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and diagnostic procedures such as thoracentesis. The management of pleural effusion depends on its etiology and severity and may include treating the underlying condition, draining the accumulated fluid, and addressing complications such as infection or recurrence. This activity for healthcare professionals reviews the evaluation and management of pleural effusion by increasing proficiency in diagnosing pleural effusion through clinical assessment and interpretation of imaging studies and pleural fluid analysis and highlights the important role of interprofessional collaboration to improve patient outcomes with pleural effusion. **Objectives:** - Identify the causes of pleural effusion based on a patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic test results. - Differentiate between transudative and exudative pleural effusions based on laboratory pleural fluid analysis and clinical judgment. - Determine a personalized management strategy for a patient with pleural effusion. - Implement interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance retrobulbar block and improve outcomes.

Under normal circumstances, a small amount of fluid is continuously produced and reabsorbed within this space to maintain lubrication and facilitate smooth movement of the lungs during respiration. However, various pathological processes can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to excessive fluid accumulation. In the United States alone, approximately 1.5 million patients are affected annually.[1][2] A pleural effusion is a marker of increased morbidity and mortality in certain populations.[3]
