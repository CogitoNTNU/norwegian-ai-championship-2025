Deep-vein thrombosis is a common and important disease. It is part of the venous thromboembolism disorders, representing the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attacks and stroke. Even in patients who do not get pulmonary emboli, recurrent thrombosis and "post-thrombotic syndrome" are major causes of morbidity. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of deep vein thrombosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition. **Objectives:** - Discuss the risk factors for developing deep vein thrombosis. - Describe the examination findings and evaluation process of a patient with suspected deep vein thrombosis, including indicated laboratory analysis. - Summarize the treatment and management strategies for deep vein thrombosis, including preventative measures. - Outline the evaluation and management of deep vein thrombosis and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

It is a common venous thromboembolic (VTE) disorder with an incidence of 1.6 per 1000 annually.[3] The rate of particular site involvement depends on the anatomical location as follows, distal veins 40%, popliteal 16%, femoral 20%, common femoral 20%, and iliac veins 4%.[4] A deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms within the deep veins, usually of the leg, but can occur in the arms and the mesenteric and cerebral veins.
