    "text": "Introduction\nBlood gas analysis is a commonly used diagnostic tool to evaluate the partial pressures of gas in blood and acid-base content. Understanding and using blood gas analysis enables providers to interpret respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic disorders. A \"blood gas analysis\" can be performed on blood obtained from anywhere in the circulatory system (artery, vein, or capillary). An arterial blood gas (ABG) explicitly tests blood taken from an artery. ABG analysis assesses the patient's partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2). PaO2 provides information on the oxygenation status, and PaCO2 offers information on the ventilation status (chronic or acute respiratory failure). PaCO2 is affected by hyperventilation (rapid or deep breathing), hypoventilation (slow or shallow breathing), and acid-base status. Although oxygenation and ventilation can be assessed non-invasively via pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, respectively, ABG analysis is the standard. When assessing the acid-base balance, most ABG analyzers measure the pH and PaCO2 directly. A derivative of the Hasselbach equation calculates the serum bicarbonate (HCO3) and base deficit or excess. This calculation frequently results in a discrepancy from the measured value due to the blood CO2 unaccounted for by the equation. The measured HCO3 uses a strong alkali that liberates all CO2 in serum, including dissolved CO2, carbamino compounds, and carbonic acid. The calculation only accounts for dissolved CO2; this measurement uses a standard chemistry analysis and will likely be called a \"total CO2\". Therefore, the difference will amount to around 1.2 mmol/L. However, a more considerable difference may be seen in the ABG compared to the measured value, especially in critically ill patients. The calculation has been disputed as both accurate and inaccurate based on the study, machine, or calibration used and must be interpreted appropriately based on institutional standards. Emergency medicine, intensivist, anesthesiology, and pulmonology clinicians frequently order arterial blood gases, which may also be used in other clinical settings."

Emergency medicine, intensivist, anesthesiology, and pulmonology clinicians frequently order arterial blood gases, which may also be used in other clinical settings. Specimen Requirements and Procedure\nWhole blood is the required specimen for an arterial blood gas sample. The specimen is obtained through an arterial puncture or acquired from an indwelling arterial catheter. A description of these procedures is beyond the scope of this article; please refer to the StatPearls article \u201cArterial Lines\u201d and other references for more information. Once obtained, the arterial blood sample should be placed on ice and analyzed as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of erroneous results. Differences in measured blood gas values between arterial and venous blood are most pronounced for PO2, as PO2 is the only clinical reason for obtaining arterial collections. PO2 is generally approximately 60 mm Hg lower in venous blood after O2 is released in the capillaries, whereas PCO2 is 2 to 8 mm Hg higher in venous blood. pH is generally only 0.02 to 0.05 pH units lower in a venous sample. Proper specimen collection is paramount in obtaining accurate blood analysis results for gas and pH. Placement of indwelling catheters with heparin locks for short- and long-term intravenous therapies is typical. Failure to flush the lock properly has unpredictable effects on measured quantities and is often indicated by bizarre, non-physiologic results. Arterial or venous specimens must be collected anaerobically with lyophilized heparin anticoagulant in 1- to 3-mL sterile syringes. Evacuated lithium heparin sample tubes (vacuum tubes) used for plasma collection are not acceptable for analysis as these evacuated tubes still contain a significant amount of oxygen and will impact the accuracy of the measured whole blood PO2."

Syringes containing lyophilized heparin are preferable to those containing liquid heparin, as liquid heparin has atmospheric PO2 and PCO2 values that dilute the sample; when the syringe is not filled, the effect is most significant. An increasing ratio of liquid heparin to blood can have an increasingly marked effect on measured PCO2 and the parameters calculated from it. Variations in syringe manufacturing can create significant differences in pre-analytical effects on the sample. The anaerobic collection technique means no blood exposure to atmospheric air. The PCO2 of air is approximately 0.25 mm Hg, much less than that of blood (40 mm Hg). Thus, the CO2 content and PCO2 of blood exposed to air will decrease, and blood pH, a function of PCO2, will rise. The PO2 of atmospheric air (155 mm Hg) is approximately 60 mm Hg higher than that of arterial blood and approximately 100 mm Hg higher than venous blood. Hence, blood exposed to atmospheric air in a patient\u2019s breathing room absorbs oxygen, while blood with a PO2 exceeding 150 mm Hg, a condition observed in patients undergoing oxygen therapy, releases oxygen. Blood exposure to air can occur simply from the air in the needle and the syringe hub dead space. The error will be minimal if the resulting bubble is ejected immediately after drawing by holding the syringe tip up and ejecting a small drop of blood. The potential effect of small bubbles on blood gas results was demonstrated in one study in which a 100-mL bubble of room air was added to 10, 2-mL blood samples with PO2 values between 25 and 40 mm Hg. PO2 increased an average of 4 mm Hg in these samples in only 2 minutes, whereas PCO2 decreased by 4 mm Hg. Before analysis, mixing the sample by vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms should be done to establish a homogeneous sample."

Before analysis, mixing the sample by vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms should be done to establish a homogeneous sample. Arterialized capillary blood is sometimes an acceptable alternative to arterial blood when an arterial cannula is unavailable or repeated arterial punctures must be avoided. Automated blood gas analyzers are commonly used to analyze blood gas samples, and results are obtained within 10 to 15 minutes. Automated blood gas analyzers, directly and indirectly, measure specific components of the arterial blood gas sample (see above). ABG components include the following:\n- pH = _measured_ acid-base balance of the blood\n- PaO2 = _measured the_ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood\n- PaCO2 =_measured_ the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood\n- HCO3 = _calculated_ concentration of bicarbonate in arterial blood\n- Base excess/deficit = _calculated_ relative excess or deficit of base in arterial blood\n- SaO2 =_calculated_ arterial oxygen saturation (unless a co-oximetry is obtained, in which case it is _measured)_\nA modified Allen test is necessary before an ABG is drawn from either upper extremity to check for adequate collateral flow. Alternatively, use pulse oximetry and duplex ultrasound. The arterial site commonly used is the radial artery, which is superficial and easily palpable over the radial styloid process. The next most common site is the femoral artery. The test is performed on the unilateral upper extremity chosen for the procedure (see **Figure 1. ** Modified Allen Test). Have the patient flex the selected upper extremity at the elbow and clench a raised fist for 30 seconds. Apply pressure over the ulnar and radial arteries to occlude the blood flow. After 5 seconds, the patient may unclench the raised fist. The palm will now appear pale, white, or blanched. Then, pressure over the ulnar artery is released while the radial artery compression is maintained. In 10 to 15 seconds, the palm returns to its original color, indicating adequate ulnar collateral blood flow."

Testing Procedures\nOperating a traditional blood gas instrument begins with the operator presenting a blood specimen at the sample probe. The sample is taken through the probe by a peristaltic pump that loads the chamber with a specific amount of the sample. The sample then resides in the chamber long enough to allow thermal equilibration and completion of measurements. On completion of the measurement, the pump pushes the sample to waste. Because electrodes are not stable for very long, frequent calibration of pH, PCO2, and PO2 is required. Most instruments contain a barometer so that barometric pressure P(Amb) is always known to the microprocessor during calibration. Other instruments perform point-of-care or bedside testing. Almost all manufacturers now produce small, portable, stand-alone, easy-to-operate instruments designed for \u201csatellite lab\u201d operations; several hand-held devices that use disposable electrodes are also available. The sophistication of contemporary equipment and availability of high-quality calibrator materials have made reliable and accurate determination of blood pH and gases primarily due to meticulous maintenance, adherence to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures, control of the equipment, and proper collection and handling of specimens. Software programs of the instrument\u2019s microprocessor often provide display warnings and diagnostic routines that alert the operator and assist in troubleshooting. The manufacturer\u2019s suggested maintenance schedule should be considered a minimum guideline, relying on experience to indicate maintenance frequency. Cleanliness of the sample chamber and path is essential. Automatic flushing to cleanse the sample chamber and path after each blood sample measurement is a feature of most instruments without disposable electrodes. Despite proper flushing, however, complete or partial clogging of the chamber or path may occur."

Despite proper flushing, however, complete or partial clogging of the chamber or path may occur. Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings\nAn acceptable normal range of ABG values of ABG components is the following, noting that the range of normal values may vary among laboratories and in different age groups from neonates to geriatrics:\n- pH (7.35-7.45)\n- PaO2 (75-100 mm Hg)\n- PaCO2 (35-45 mm Hg)\n- HCO3 (22-26 mEq/L)\n- Base excess/deficit (-4 to +2)\n- SaO2 (95-100%)\nIt is best to approach arterial blood gas interpretation systematically. Interpretation leads to understanding the degree or severity of abnormalities, whether the abnormalities are acute or chronic, and whether the primary disorder is metabolic or respiratory in origin. Several articles have described simplistic ways to interpret ABG results. However, the Romanski method of analysis is most simplistic for all levels of providers. This method helps determine the presence of an acid-base disorder, its primary cause, and whether compensation is present. The first step is to look at the pH and assess for the presence of acidemia (pH < 7.35) or alkalemia (pH > 7.45). If the pH is in the normal range (7.35-7.45), use a pH of 7.40 as a cutoff point. In other words, categorize a pH of 7.37 as acidosis and a pH of 7.42 as alkalemia. Next, evaluate the respiratory and metabolic components of the ABG results, the PaCO2 and HCO3, respectively. The PaCO2 indicates whether the acidosis or alkalemia is primarily from a respiratory or metabolic acidosis/alkalosis. PaCO2 > 40 with a pH < 7.4 indicates a respiratory acidosis, while PaCO2 < 40 and pH > 7.4 indicates a respiratory alkalosis (but is often from hyperventilation from anxiety or compensation for a metabolic acidosis)."

PaCO2 > 40 with a pH < 7.4 indicates a respiratory acidosis, while PaCO2 < 40 and pH > 7.4 indicates a respiratory alkalosis (but is often from hyperventilation from anxiety or compensation for a metabolic acidosis). Next, assess for evidence of compensation for the primary acidosis or alkalosis by looking for the value (PaCO2 or HCO3) inconsistent with the pH. Lastly, assess the PaO2 for any abnormalities in oxygenation. Example 1\\[28\\]: ABG: pH = 7.39, PaCO2 = 51 mm Hg, PaO2 = 59 mm Hg, HCO3 = 30 mEq/L and SaO2 = 90%, on room air. 1. pH is in the normal range, so use 7.40 as a cutoff point, in which case it is < 7.40, and acidosis is present. 1. The elevated PaCO2 indicates respiratory acidosis, and the elevated HCO3 indicates a metabolic alkalosis. 1. The value consistent with the pH is PaCO2. Therefore, this is a primary respiratory acidosis. The acid-base that is inconsistent with the pH is the elevated HCO3, indicating a metabolic alkalosis, so there is compensation signifying a non-acute primary disorder because it takes days for metabolic compensation to be effective. 1. Last, the decreased PaO2 indicates an abnormality with oxygenation. However, a history and physical will help delineate the severity and urgency of required interventions, if any. Example 2\\[28\\]: ABG: pH = 7.45, PaCO2 = 32 mm Hg, PaO2 = 138 mm Hg, HCO3 = 23 mEq/L, the base deficit = 1 mEq/L, and SaO2 is 92%, on room air. 1. pH is in the normal range. Using 7.40 as a cutoff point, it is >7.40, so alkalemia is present. 1. The decreased PaCO2 indicates a respiratory alkalosis, and the HCO3 is normal but on the low end of normal. 1. The value consistent with the pH is PaCO2. Therefore, this is a primary respiratory alkalosis. The HCO3 is in the normal range and, thus, not inconsistent with the pH, so there is a lack of compensation. 1. Last, the PaO2 is within the normal range, so there is no abnormality in oxygenation."

Clinical Significance\nArterial blood gas monitoring is the standard for assessing a patient\u2019s oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status. Although ABG monitoring has been replaced mainly by non-invasive monitoring, it is still helpful in confirming and calibrating non-invasive monitoring techniques. Frequently performed is the evaluation of oxygenation in the context of severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and ARDS In the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency room settings. Calculating an alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient can aid in narrowing down the hypoxemia cause. For example, a gradient\u2019s presence or absence can help determine whether the abnormality in oxygenation is potentially due to hypoventilation, a shunt, V/Q mismatch, or impaired diffusion. The equation for the expected A-a gradient assumes the patient is breathing room air; therefore, the A-a gradient is less accurate at higher percentages of inspired oxygen. Determining the intrapulmonary shunt fraction, the fraction of cardiac output flowing through pulmonary units that do not contribute to gas exchange, is the best estimate of oxygenation status. Calculating the shunt fraction is traditionally done at a delivered FiO2 of 1.0, but if performed at a FiO2 lower than 1.0, venous admixture would be the more appropriate term. For simplicity, assessing oxygenation is more commonly performed by computing the ratio of PaO2 and the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio). However, there are limitations in using the P/F ratio in assessing oxygenation, as the discrepancy between venous admixture and the P/F ratio at a given shunt fraction depends on the delivered FiO2. Researchers use the P/F ratio to categorize disease severity in ARDS."

Researchers use the P/F ratio to categorize disease severity in ARDS. Another parameter commonly used in ICUs to assess oxygenation is the oxygenation index (OI). This index is considered a better indicator of lung injury, particularly in the neonatal and pediatric population, compared to the P/F ratio. This index also includes the level of invasive ventilatory support required to maintain oxygenation. The OI is the product of the mean airway pressure (Paw) in cm H2O, measured by the ventilator, and the FiO2 is the percentage divided by the PaO2. The OI is commonly used to guide management, such as initiating inhaled nitric oxide, administering surfactant, and defining the potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A normal PaO2 value does not rule out respiratory failure, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen. The PaCO2 reflects pulmonary ventilation and cellular CO2 production. It is a more sensitive marker of ventilatory failure than PaO2, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen, as it is closely related to the depth and rate of breathing. Calculating the pulmonary dead space is a good indicator of overall lung function. Pulmonary dead space is the difference between the PaCO2 and mixed expired PCO2 (physiological dead space) or the end-tidal PCO2 divided by the PaCO2. Pulmonary dead space increases when the pulmonary units\u2019 ventilation increases relative to their perfusion, and shunting increases. Hence, pulmonary dead space is an excellent bedside indicator of lung function and one of the best prognostic factors in ARDS patients. The pulmonary dead space fraction may also help diagnose other conditions, such as pulmonary embolism. Acid-base balance can be affected by the aforementioned respiratory system abnormalities. For instance, acute respiratory acidosis and alkalemia result in acidemia and alkalemia, respectively. Additionally, hypoxemic hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism, which causes metabolic acidosis that results in acidemia. Metabolic system abnormalities also affect acid balance, as acute metabolic acidosis and alkalosis result in acidemia and alkalemia."

Quality Control and Lab Safety\nHealthcare providers can analyze an arterial blood gas and electrolytes (often called a shock panel) as a point-of-care test. Appropriately calibrate or standardize these machines to ensure accurate and precise readings for clinical decisions. Please refer to the user manuals to ensure the appropriate device calibration during discussion with the clinical laboratory team. Elements of good quality assurance of blood gas and pH measurements include the following:\n- Proper maintenance of the instrument\n- Use of control materials\n- Verification of electrode linearity\n- Checking barometer accuracy\n- Accurately measuring temperature. External quality assurance (proficiency testing) mandated by federal law in the United States (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] 1988) has assumed new importance for quality control of blood gas analysis. These rules became effective in January 1991 and set criteria for satisfactory interlaboratory performance, which are as follows: pH, target value _\u00b1_ 0.04; PO2, target value _\u00b1_ 3 SD; and PCO2, target value _\u00b1_ 8% or _\u00b1_ 5 mm Hg, whichever is greater. The significance of proficiency testing and the penalties for failure place strong incentives on consistent performance of internal control measures and effective response to quality control failures. At the same time, the pressure to control costs has raised the question of how often one should monitor interlaboratory performance effectively and determine the necessary concentrations of control materials. Per CLIA 1988, the answer is one concentration of control every 8 hours, with the entire range of control concentrations covered every 24 hours."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nABG should be used to assess a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and oxygenation status. Additionally, blood gas analysis is recommended to assess a patient's response to therapeutic interventions and to monitor the severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease processes. Despite its clinical value, erroneous or discrepant values represent a potential drawback of blood gas analysis, so eliminating potential sources of error is paramount. Therefore, attention to detail in the sampling technique and processing is essential. Rigorous quality control of the automated blood gas analyzers is also necessary for accurate results. However, machine performance and quality assurance advances have now made most errors in point-of-care analysis of ABGs attributable to clinical providers. Several pre-analytic steps must be followed to obtain a valid, interpretable ABG. In most hospital settings, ABG analysis is a process that involves multiple healthcare providers (eg, physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses). Hence, interprofessional coordination, cooperation, and communication are vitally important. The American Association for Respiratory Care has published Clinical Care Guidelines for Blood Gas Analysis and Hemoximetry that provide current best practices for sampling, handling, and analyzing ABGs. Notable sources of erroneous values during blood draws include abnormal or misstated FiO2, barometric pressures, or temperatures. Temperature is a significant variable, leading to PaO2 and O2 saturation discrepancies, as do acid-base disturbances. Several physiological and clinical conditions, such as hyperleukocytosis and dyshemoglobinemias, can also lead to PaO2 and O2 saturation discrepancies. Sample dilution can be an additional error source, with liquid heparin and saline as potential culprits. The mode of sample transportation is also of significance as discrepant values can result from air contamination after pneumatic tube system transport, compared with manual transport of the specimen, especially in the presence of inadvertent air bubbles."

    "text": "Definition/Introduction\nArterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is crucial for treating patients who are critically ill and on mechanical ventilation. This test provides vital information about acid-base balance, oxygenation, and ventilation status, guiding ventilator setting adjustments. For instance, a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood may require increasing the respiratory rate or tidal volume to enhance carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, while a low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) may necessitate increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygenation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on ABG results are vital for preventing complications and improving outcomes. This activity provides a guide on adjusting ventilator parameters based on ABG results, emphasizing individualized care and evidence-based practices. **Basic Ventilator Parameters**\nVentilator parameters are critical in cases requiring mechanical ventilation. Understanding and properly adjusting these parameters are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. The key adjustable ventilator parameters include the tidal volume (Vt), frequency (F), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), PEEP, inspiratory time (Ti), inspiratory flow (V\u2019), and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E). **Tidal volume**\nVt is the amount of air delivered to the lungs with each ventilator breath. Vt is typically set based on the patient\u2019s predicted body weight. Proper Vt setting is crucial to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. Lower Vts are generally preferred to reduce the risk of overdistension and subsequent lung damage, particularly in conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome. **Frequency**\nF or respiratory rate is the number of breaths the ventilator delivers per minute. Adjusting the respiratory rate helps manage the patient\u2019s CO2 levels. A higher respiratory rate can help reduce PaCO2 in those who RE hypercapnic, but it must be balanced to avoid intrinsic PEEP and ensure adequate expiratory time. **Fraction of inspired oxygen**\nFiO2 is the concentration of oxygen delivered to the patient."

A higher respiratory rate can help reduce PaCO2 in those who RE hypercapnic, but it must be balanced to avoid intrinsic PEEP and ensure adequate expiratory time. **Fraction of inspired oxygen**\nFiO2 is the concentration of oxygen delivered to the patient. FiO2 is expressed as a fraction of 1.0 (eg, 0.21 for room air and 1.0 for 100% oxygen). FiO2 is adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation. Prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels can cause oxygen toxicity, so the goal is to use the lowest FiO2 that achieves satisfactory oxygenation. **Positive end-expiratory pressure**\nPEEP is the pressure in the lungs (above atmospheric pressure) that remains at the end of the expiratory phase of ventilation. PEEP helps to keep alveoli open, improve oxygenation, and prevent atelectasis. However, excessive PEEP can lead to overdistension and barotrauma. The optimal PEEP level balances these factors to maximize alveolar recruitment while minimizing lung injury. **Inspiratory time**\nTi is the duration of the inspiratory phase of ventilation. Adjusting inspiratory time can influence gas exchange and patient comfort. Longer inspiratory times can improve oxygenation but may increase auto-PEEP risk if not properly managed. **Inspiratory flow**\nV\u2019 is the rate at which air is delivered to the patient during the inspiratory phase. Adjusting inspiratory flow can affect the distribution of ventilation within the lungs and the patient\u2019s work of breathing. Faster flow rates can decrease inspiratory time and increase peak airway pressures. **Inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio**\nI:E is the ratio of the duration of the inspiratory phase to the expiratory phase. This variable is typically set to 1:2 to mimic normal breathing patterns. Adjusting the I:E ratio can improve oxygenation and CO2 clearance. An inverse I:E ratio (more time in inspiration) may be used in severe hypoxemia but requires careful monitoring to avoid auto-PEEP. **Basic Components of Arterial Blood Gas Analysis**\nABG analysis evaluates a patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance. The primary components of an ABG report include pH, PaCO2, PaO2, bicarbonate (HCO3-), and base excess. Together, these parameters provide critical insights for diagnosing and managing respiratory, metabolic, and systemic conditions. **pH**\nThe pH measures the hydrogen ion concentration in the blood, indicating the acidity or alkalinity."

The normal pH range is 7.35 to 7.45. A pH below 7.35 indicates acidosis, while a pH above 7.45 indicates alkalosis. This variable determines the acid-base balance and guides the diagnosis of respiratory and metabolic disorders. **Partial pressure of carbon dioxide**\nThe PaCO2 measures the pressure of carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood. The normal PaCO2 range is 35 to 45 mm Hg. An elevated PaCO2 (>45 mm Hg) indicates hypercapnia, commonly due to hypoventilation. Decreased PaCO2 (\\<35 mm Hg) indicates hypocapnia, often from hyperventilation. PaCO2 is crucial for assessing the respiratory component of the acid-base balance. **Partial pressure of oxygen**\nThe PaO2 measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood.

Low PaO2 (\\<80 mm Hg) indicates hypoxemia, which can result from various respiratory disorders. **Bicarbonate**\nHCO3- is a base that helps buffer the blood\u2019s pH. The normal HCO3- range is 22 to 26 mmol/L. HCO3- levels reflect the metabolic component of the acid-base balance. Increased HCO3- indicates metabolic alkalosis, while decreased HCO3- indicates metabolic acidosis. **Base excess**\nBase excess (BE) measures the amount of excess or deficient base in the blood. The normal range is -2 to +2 mmol/L. A positive BE indicates metabolic alkalosis, while a negative BE indicates metabolic acidosis. BE helps assess the metabolic component of acid-base disorders. **Basic Interpretation of ABG Results**\nABG analysis is crucial in assessing and managing acid-base imbalance. The body compensates through respiratory or metabolic adjustments to restore balance. Information from ABG analysis helps determine the kind and severity of imbalance, guiding treatment. **Acidosis vs alkalosis**\nRespiratory acidosis is characterized by a low pH and a high PaCO2. The causes of this condition include hypoventilation from conditions such as respiratory depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neuromuscular disorders. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by low pH and HCO3-."

The causes of this condition include hypoventilation from conditions such as respiratory depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neuromuscular disorders. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by low pH and HCO3-. Issues of Concern\n**Adjusting Ventilator Settings Based on Arterial Blood Gas Analysis Results**\nVentilator setting adjustments are often guided by both clinical evaluation and ABG analysis. Specific strategies are explained below. **Hypoxemia**\nHypoxemia is characterized by a low PaO2. Increasing FiO2 can improve oxygenation. However, prolonged high FiO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity. Thus, the goal is to maintain PaO2 within the target range using the lowest FiO2 required. Increasing PEEP is a strategy that improves oxygenation by keeping the alveoli open. Optimal PEEP settings can enhance gas exchange and reduce the risk of atelectasis. Longer Ti can improve oxygenation but may increase auto-PEEP risk if not properly managed. An inverse I:E ratio may be used in severe hypoxemia but requires careful monitoring to avoid auto-PEEP. **Acidosis**\nAcidosis is characterized by a low arterial pH. Respiratory acidosis features a low arterial pH due to a high PaCO2. Increasing the respiratory rate helps remove CO2, thus lowering PaCO2. Care must be taken to avoid inducing respiratory alkalosis or auto-PEEP due to insufficient exhalation time. Increasing Vt can also enhance CO2 removal. However, excessive Vts can lead to volutrauma and barotrauma, underscoring the need for balance. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low HCO3-. Addressing the underlying metabolic cause while maintaining adequate ventilation is the principle of ventilator management in metabolic acidosis. **Alkalosis**\nAlkalosis features a high arterial pH, which can arise from either a respiratory or metabolic source. Respiratory alkalosis arises from a low PaCO2. Reducing the respiratory rate allows more CO2 to accumulate in the alveoli, thereby increasing PaCO2 and improving respiratory alkalosis."

Reducing the respiratory rate allows more CO2 to accumulate in the alveoli, thereby increasing PaCO2 and improving respiratory alkalosis. Clinical Significance\n**Considerations for Adjusting Ventilator Settings in Special Circumstances**\nAdjusting ventilator settings according to the specific respiratory condition of the patient is critical to optimizing outcomes and minimizing complications. Below are special considerations for common respiratory conditions. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung condition that obstructs airflow, primarily caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particles\u2014most often from cigarette smoke. COPD encompasses emphysema, is characterized by alveolar destruction and chronic bronchitis, and is marked by long-term cough with mucus due to airway inflammation. Patients with COPD often encounter significant challenges, such as hypercapnia and dynamic hyperinflation during mechanical ventilation. These issues arise due to increased airway resistance and high pulmonary dead space, which collectively elevate the work of breathing and complicate ventilatory management. Adjusting ventilator settings appropriately is crucial to mitigate these complications and optimize respiratory support. **Ventilator adjustments in patients with c**hronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n- Using low tidal volumes: Applying lower tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight) helps prevent barotrauma and volutrauma by minimizing the risk of lung overdistension. - Managing PEEP carefully: While PEEP can help maintain alveolar recruitment, excessive PEEP may worsen dynamic hyperinflation. The optimal PEEP level should be carefully titrated to balance oxygenation improvement and avoid auto-PEEP. - Adjusting respiratory rate: A lower respiratory rate allows for longer exhalation times, reducing the risk of dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome**\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition marked by poor oxygenation and reduced lung compliance. ARDS involves capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage. The condition is associated with high mortality and limited effective treatments."

This strategy has been shown to improve survival in patients with ARDS. - Appropriate PEEP levels: Applying PEEP helps prevent alveolar collapse and improves oxygenation. The PEEP level should be adjusted to optimize lung recruitment while avoiding overdistension. - Avoiding high plateau pressures: Plateau pressures lower than 30 cm H2O must be targeted. The plateau pressure is a measure of pulmonary compliance. - Avoiding high driving pressure: Monitoring and minimizing driving pressure\u2014the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP\u2014is essential for reducing the risk of VILI. Targeting a driving pressure below 15 cm H2O is associated with better outcomes. **Bronchial Asthma**\nBronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and variable airflow obstruction. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing which can vary over time and in intensity. Patients with asthma are at risk of dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP during mechanical ventilation. **Ventilator adjustments in patients with bronchial asthma**\nLower tidal volumes, slower respiratory rates, and shorter inspiratory times are recommended to allow for adequate exhalation time. Avoiding high PEEP levels is essential to prevent dynamic hyperinflation in patients with bronchial asthma. **Restrictive Lung Diseases**\nRestrictive lung diseases are a diverse group of pulmonary disorders characterized by reduced lung distensibility, thus limiting lung expansion and decreasing lung volumes, particularly total lung capacity."

Critical care nurses and respiratory therapists are pivotal in continuously monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings. These professionals must be familiar with interpreting ABG results and understanding the physiological implications of pH, PaCO2, and PaO2 changes. Their expertise in making real-time adjustments to basic ventilator settings based on ABG results is essential to maintaining optimal gas exchange and preventing complications. Moreover, critical care clinicians and advanced nursing healthcare professionals provide oversight and make high-level decisions regarding ventilator management.\nImplementing safety protocols to prevent ventilator-associated complications such as barotrauma, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity is vital. Regular training on ventilator management and simulation exercises can help healthcare teams stay proficient in emergency procedures and routine adjustments. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines for adjusting ventilator parameters based on ABG results ensures that patient care is both effective and up-to-date. Continuous professional development and staying in line with the latest research in ventilator management are necessary for all team members."

    "text": "Introduction\nBlood gas analysis is a commonly used diagnostic tool to evaluate the partial pressures of gas in blood and acid-base content. Understanding and using blood gas analysis enables providers to interpret respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic disorders. A \"blood gas analysis\" can be performed on blood obtained from anywhere in the circulatory system (artery, vein, or capillary). An arterial blood gas (ABG) explicitly tests blood taken from an artery. ABG analysis assesses the patient's partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2). PaO2 provides information on the oxygenation status, and PaCO2 offers information on the ventilation status (chronic or acute respiratory failure). PaCO2 is affected by hyperventilation (rapid or deep breathing), hypoventilation (slow or shallow breathing), and acid-base status. Although oxygenation and ventilation can be assessed non-invasively via pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, respectively, ABG analysis is the standard. When assessing the acid-base balance, most ABG analyzers measure the pH and PaCO2 directly. A derivative of the Hasselbach equation calculates the serum bicarbonate (HCO3) and base deficit or excess. This calculation frequently results in a discrepancy from the measured value due to the blood CO2 unaccounted for by the equation. The measured HCO3 uses a strong alkali that liberates all CO2 in serum, including dissolved CO2, carbamino compounds, and carbonic acid. The calculation only accounts for dissolved CO2; this measurement uses a standard chemistry analysis and will likely be called a \"total CO2\". Therefore, the difference will amount to around 1.2 mmol/L. However, a more considerable difference may be seen in the ABG compared to the measured value, especially in critically ill patients. The calculation has been disputed as both accurate and inaccurate based on the study, machine, or calibration used and must be interpreted appropriately based on institutional standards. Emergency medicine, intensivist, anesthesiology, and pulmonology clinicians frequently order arterial blood gases, which may also be used in other clinical settings."

Emergency medicine, intensivist, anesthesiology, and pulmonology clinicians frequently order arterial blood gases, which may also be used in other clinical settings. Specimen Requirements and Procedure\nWhole blood is the required specimen for an arterial blood gas sample. The specimen is obtained through an arterial puncture or acquired from an indwelling arterial catheter. A description of these procedures is beyond the scope of this article; please refer to the StatPearls article \u201cArterial Lines\u201d and other references for more information. Once obtained, the arterial blood sample should be placed on ice and analyzed as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of erroneous results. Differences in measured blood gas values between arterial and venous blood are most pronounced for PO2, as PO2 is the only clinical reason for obtaining arterial collections. PO2 is generally approximately 60 mm Hg lower in venous blood after O2 is released in the capillaries, whereas PCO2 is 2 to 8 mm Hg higher in venous blood. pH is generally only 0.02 to 0.05 pH units lower in a venous sample. Proper specimen collection is paramount in obtaining accurate blood analysis results for gas and pH. Placement of indwelling catheters with heparin locks for short- and long-term intravenous therapies is typical. Failure to flush the lock properly has unpredictable effects on measured quantities and is often indicated by bizarre, non-physiologic results. Arterial or venous specimens must be collected anaerobically with lyophilized heparin anticoagulant in 1- to 3-mL sterile syringes. Evacuated lithium heparin sample tubes (vacuum tubes) used for plasma collection are not acceptable for analysis as these evacuated tubes still contain a significant amount of oxygen and will impact the accuracy of the measured whole blood PO2."

Syringes containing lyophilized heparin are preferable to those containing liquid heparin, as liquid heparin has atmospheric PO2 and PCO2 values that dilute the sample; when the syringe is not filled, the effect is most significant. An increasing ratio of liquid heparin to blood can have an increasingly marked effect on measured PCO2 and the parameters calculated from it. Variations in syringe manufacturing can create significant differences in pre-analytical effects on the sample. The anaerobic collection technique means no blood exposure to atmospheric air. The PCO2 of air is approximately 0.25 mm Hg, much less than that of blood (40 mm Hg). Thus, the CO2 content and PCO2 of blood exposed to air will decrease, and blood pH, a function of PCO2, will rise. The PO2 of atmospheric air (155 mm Hg) is approximately 60 mm Hg higher than that of arterial blood and approximately 100 mm Hg higher than venous blood. Hence, blood exposed to atmospheric air in a patient\u2019s breathing room absorbs oxygen, while blood with a PO2 exceeding 150 mm Hg, a condition observed in patients undergoing oxygen therapy, releases oxygen. Blood exposure to air can occur simply from the air in the needle and the syringe hub dead space. The error will be minimal if the resulting bubble is ejected immediately after drawing by holding the syringe tip up and ejecting a small drop of blood. The potential effect of small bubbles on blood gas results was demonstrated in one study in which a 100-mL bubble of room air was added to 10, 2-mL blood samples with PO2 values between 25 and 40 mm Hg. PO2 increased an average of 4 mm Hg in these samples in only 2 minutes, whereas PCO2 decreased by 4 mm Hg. Before analysis, mixing the sample by vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms should be done to establish a homogeneous sample."

Arterialized capillary blood is sometimes an acceptable alternative to arterial blood when an arterial cannula is unavailable or repeated arterial punctures must be avoided. Automated blood gas analyzers are commonly used to analyze blood gas samples, and results are obtained within 10 to 15 minutes. Automated blood gas analyzers, directly and indirectly, measure specific components of the arterial blood gas sample (see above). ABG components include the following:\n- pH = _measured_ acid-base balance of the blood\n- PaO2 = _measured the_ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood\n- PaCO2 =_measured_ the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood\n- HCO3 = _calculated_ concentration of bicarbonate in arterial blood\n- Base excess/deficit = _calculated_ relative excess or deficit of base in arterial blood\n- SaO2 =_calculated_ arterial oxygen saturation (unless a co-oximetry is obtained, in which case it is _measured)_\nA modified Allen test is necessary before an ABG is drawn from either upper extremity to check for adequate collateral flow. Alternatively, use pulse oximetry and duplex ultrasound. The arterial site commonly used is the radial artery, which is superficial and easily palpable over the radial styloid process. The next most common site is the femoral artery. The test is performed on the unilateral upper extremity chosen for the procedure (see **Figure 1. ** Modified Allen Test). Have the patient flex the selected upper extremity at the elbow and clench a raised fist for 30 seconds. Apply pressure over the ulnar and radial arteries to occlude the blood flow. After 5 seconds, the patient may unclench the raised fist. The palm will now appear pale, white, or blanched. Then, pressure over the ulnar artery is released while the radial artery compression is maintained. In 10 to 15 seconds, the palm returns to its original color, indicating adequate ulnar collateral blood flow."

Testing Procedures\nOperating a traditional blood gas instrument begins with the operator presenting a blood specimen at the sample probe. The sample is taken through the probe by a peristaltic pump that loads the chamber with a specific amount of the sample. The sample then resides in the chamber long enough to allow thermal equilibration and completion of measurements. On completion of the measurement, the pump pushes the sample to waste. Because electrodes are not stable for very long, frequent calibration of pH, PCO2, and PO2 is required. Most instruments contain a barometer so that barometric pressure P(Amb) is always known to the microprocessor during calibration. Other instruments perform point-of-care or bedside testing. Almost all manufacturers now produce small, portable, stand-alone, easy-to-operate instruments designed for \u201csatellite lab\u201d operations; several hand-held devices that use disposable electrodes are also available. The sophistication of contemporary equipment and availability of high-quality calibrator materials have made reliable and accurate determination of blood pH and gases primarily due to meticulous maintenance, adherence to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures, control of the equipment, and proper collection and handling of specimens. Software programs of the instrument\u2019s microprocessor often provide display warnings and diagnostic routines that alert the operator and assist in troubleshooting. The manufacturer\u2019s suggested maintenance schedule should be considered a minimum guideline, relying on experience to indicate maintenance frequency. Cleanliness of the sample chamber and path is essential. Automatic flushing to cleanse the sample chamber and path after each blood sample measurement is a feature of most instruments without disposable electrodes. Despite proper flushing, however, complete or partial clogging of the chamber or path may occur."

Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings\nAn acceptable normal range of ABG values of ABG components is the following, noting that the range of normal values may vary among laboratories and in different age groups from neonates to geriatrics:\n- pH (7.35-7.45)\n- PaO2 (75-100 mm Hg)\n- PaCO2 (35-45 mm Hg)\n- HCO3 (22-26 mEq/L)\n- Base excess/deficit (-4 to +2)\n- SaO2 (95-100%)\nIt is best to approach arterial blood gas interpretation systematically. Interpretation leads to understanding the degree or severity of abnormalities, whether the abnormalities are acute or chronic, and whether the primary disorder is metabolic or respiratory in origin. Several articles have described simplistic ways to interpret ABG results. However, the Romanski method of analysis is most simplistic for all levels of providers. This method helps determine the presence of an acid-base disorder, its primary cause, and whether compensation is present. The first step is to look at the pH and assess for the presence of acidemia (pH < 7.35) or alkalemia (pH > 7.45). If the pH is in the normal range (7.35-7.45), use a pH of 7.40 as a cutoff point. In other words, categorize a pH of 7.37 as acidosis and a pH of 7.42 as alkalemia. Next, evaluate the respiratory and metabolic components of the ABG results, the PaCO2 and HCO3, respectively. The PaCO2 indicates whether the acidosis or alkalemia is primarily from a respiratory or metabolic acidosis/alkalosis. PaCO2 > 40 with a pH < 7.4 indicates a respiratory acidosis, while PaCO2 < 40 and pH > 7.4 indicates a respiratory alkalosis (but is often from hyperventilation from anxiety or compensation for a metabolic acidosis)."

Next, assess for evidence of compensation for the primary acidosis or alkalosis by looking for the value (PaCO2 or HCO3) inconsistent with the pH. Lastly, assess the PaO2 for any abnormalities in oxygenation. Example 1\\[28\\]: ABG: pH = 7.39, PaCO2 = 51 mm Hg, PaO2 = 59 mm Hg, HCO3 = 30 mEq/L and SaO2 = 90%, on room air. 1. pH is in the normal range, so use 7.40 as a cutoff point, in which case it is < 7.40, and acidosis is present. 1. The elevated PaCO2 indicates respiratory acidosis, and the elevated HCO3 indicates a metabolic alkalosis. 1. The value consistent with the pH is PaCO2. Therefore, this is a primary respiratory acidosis. The acid-base that is inconsistent with the pH is the elevated HCO3, indicating a metabolic alkalosis, so there is compensation signifying a non-acute primary disorder because it takes days for metabolic compensation to be effective. 1. Last, the decreased PaO2 indicates an abnormality with oxygenation. However, a history and physical will help delineate the severity and urgency of required interventions, if any. Example 2\\[28\\]: ABG: pH = 7.45, PaCO2 = 32 mm Hg, PaO2 = 138 mm Hg, HCO3 = 23 mEq/L, the base deficit = 1 mEq/L, and SaO2 is 92%, on room air. 1. pH is in the normal range. Using 7.40 as a cutoff point, it is >7.40, so alkalemia is present. 1. The decreased PaCO2 indicates a respiratory alkalosis, and the HCO3 is normal but on the low end of normal. 1. The value consistent with the pH is PaCO2. Therefore, this is a primary respiratory alkalosis. The HCO3 is in the normal range and, thus, not inconsistent with the pH, so there is a lack of compensation. 1. Last, the PaO2 is within the normal range, so there is no abnormality in oxygenation."

Clinical Significance\nArterial blood gas monitoring is the standard for assessing a patient\u2019s oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status. Although ABG monitoring has been replaced mainly by non-invasive monitoring, it is still helpful in confirming and calibrating non-invasive monitoring techniques. Frequently performed is the evaluation of oxygenation in the context of severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and ARDS In the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency room settings. Calculating an alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient can aid in narrowing down the hypoxemia cause. For example, a gradient\u2019s presence or absence can help determine whether the abnormality in oxygenation is potentially due to hypoventilation, a shunt, V/Q mismatch, or impaired diffusion. The equation for the expected A-a gradient assumes the patient is breathing room air; therefore, the A-a gradient is less accurate at higher percentages of inspired oxygen. Determining the intrapulmonary shunt fraction, the fraction of cardiac output flowing through pulmonary units that do not contribute to gas exchange, is the best estimate of oxygenation status. Calculating the shunt fraction is traditionally done at a delivered FiO2 of 1.0, but if performed at a FiO2 lower than 1.0, venous admixture would be the more appropriate term. For simplicity, assessing oxygenation is more commonly performed by computing the ratio of PaO2 and the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio). However, there are limitations in using the P/F ratio in assessing oxygenation, as the discrepancy between venous admixture and the P/F ratio at a given shunt fraction depends on the delivered FiO2. Researchers use the P/F ratio to categorize disease severity in ARDS."

Researchers use the P/F ratio to categorize disease severity in ARDS. Another parameter commonly used in ICUs to assess oxygenation is the oxygenation index (OI). This index is considered a better indicator of lung injury, particularly in the neonatal and pediatric population, compared to the P/F ratio. This index also includes the level of invasive ventilatory support required to maintain oxygenation. The OI is the product of the mean airway pressure (Paw) in cm H2O, measured by the ventilator, and the FiO2 is the percentage divided by the PaO2. The OI is commonly used to guide management, such as initiating inhaled nitric oxide, administering surfactant, and defining the potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A normal PaO2 value does not rule out respiratory failure, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen. The PaCO2 reflects pulmonary ventilation and cellular CO2 production. It is a more sensitive marker of ventilatory failure than PaO2, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen, as it is closely related to the depth and rate of breathing. Calculating the pulmonary dead space is a good indicator of overall lung function. Pulmonary dead space is the difference between the PaCO2 and mixed expired PCO2 (physiological dead space) or the end-tidal PCO2 divided by the PaCO2. Pulmonary dead space increases when the pulmonary units\u2019 ventilation increases relative to their perfusion, and shunting increases. Hence, pulmonary dead space is an excellent bedside indicator of lung function and one of the best prognostic factors in ARDS patients. The pulmonary dead space fraction may also help diagnose other conditions, such as pulmonary embolism. Acid-base balance can be affected by the aforementioned respiratory system abnormalities. For instance, acute respiratory acidosis and alkalemia result in acidemia and alkalemia, respectively. Additionally, hypoxemic hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism, which causes metabolic acidosis that results in acidemia. Metabolic system abnormalities also affect acid balance, as acute metabolic acidosis and alkalosis result in acidemia and alkalemia."

Please refer to the user manuals to ensure the appropriate device calibration during discussion with the clinical laboratory team. Elements of good quality assurance of blood gas and pH measurements include the following:\n- Proper maintenance of the instrument\n- Use of control materials\n- Verification of electrode linearity\n- Checking barometer accuracy\n- Accurately measuring temperature. External quality assurance (proficiency testing) mandated by federal law in the United States (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] 1988) has assumed new importance for quality control of blood gas analysis. These rules became effective in January 1991 and set criteria for satisfactory interlaboratory performance, which are as follows: pH, target value _\u00b1_ 0.04; PO2, target value _\u00b1_ 3 SD; and PCO2, target value _\u00b1_ 8% or _\u00b1_ 5 mm Hg, whichever is greater. The significance of proficiency testing and the penalties for failure place strong incentives on consistent performance of internal control measures and effective response to quality control failures. At the same time, the pressure to control costs has raised the question of how often one should monitor interlaboratory performance effectively and determine the necessary concentrations of control materials. Per CLIA 1988, the answer is one concentration of control every 8 hours, with the entire range of control concentrations covered every 24 hours."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nABG should be used to assess a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and oxygenation status. Additionally, blood gas analysis is recommended to assess a patient's response to therapeutic interventions and to monitor the severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease processes. Despite its clinical value, erroneous or discrepant values represent a potential drawback of blood gas analysis, so eliminating potential sources of error is paramount. Therefore, attention to detail in the sampling technique and processing is essential. Rigorous quality control of the automated blood gas analyzers is also necessary for accurate results. However, machine performance and quality assurance advances have now made most errors in point-of-care analysis of ABGs attributable to clinical providers. Several pre-analytic steps must be followed to obtain a valid, interpretable ABG. In most hospital settings, ABG analysis is a process that involves multiple healthcare providers (eg, physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses). Hence, interprofessional coordination, cooperation, and communication are vitally important. The American Association for Respiratory Care has published Clinical Care Guidelines for Blood Gas Analysis and Hemoximetry that provide current best practices for sampling, handling, and analyzing ABGs. Notable sources of erroneous values during blood draws include abnormal or misstated FiO2, barometric pressures, or temperatures. Temperature is a significant variable, leading to PaO2 and O2 saturation discrepancies, as do acid-base disturbances. Several physiological and clinical conditions, such as hyperleukocytosis and dyshemoglobinemias, can also lead to PaO2 and O2 saturation discrepancies. Sample dilution can be an additional error source, with liquid heparin and saline as potential culprits. The mode of sample transportation is also of significance as discrepant values can result from air contamination after pneumatic tube system transport, compared with manual transport of the specimen, especially in the presence of inadvertent air bubbles."
