    "text": "Etiology\nCardioembolic strokes can occur as a consequence of any cardiac insult that could cause the fulfillment of Virchow triad of endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. Commonly encountered causes include:\n- Atrial disease:\n- Arrhythmias:\n- Atrial fibrillation, specifically non-valvular atrial fibrillation, is believed to be the most prevalent cause of cardioembolic strokes. Considered the most frequently encountered sustained arrhythmia, it occurs in approximately 5% of people aged 65 years and above. In western populations, most cases are believed to occur secondary to ischemic or hypertensive heart disease. Other contributing factors include hyperthyroidism and heavy alcohol consumption. The contribution of valvular heart disease, particularly the involvement of the mitral valve, is on the decline in terms of the number of cases. However, concerning relative risk, patients with valvular atrial fibrillation have a 17-fold increased risk of cardioembolic stroke, as opposed to the 2-7 fold increased risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The CHADS2 risk stratification tool is often used to predict the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation\n- Sick sinus syndrome, also known as a bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, is also associated with an increased risk of stroke. - Structural disease:\n- Patent foramen ovale: The role of a patent foramen ovale in strokes, particularly the so-called \"cryptogenic strokes,\" is currently an area of great interest. Current evidence is insufficient to conclude about its role as a causative factor, or merely as a conduit for paradoxical emboli. - Valvular heart disease: Even with the absence of arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases correlate with an increased risk of stroke. These include:\n- Rheumatic valvular disease; the most common is rheumatic mitral stenosis. Without anticoagulation, the risk of stroke is very high. - Infective endocarditis: Approximately 10% of cases of infective endocarditis develop embolic strokes. The risk of stroke occurrence is highest before instituting, or within the first two weeks of antibiotic therapy."

The risk of stroke occurrence is highest before instituting, or within the first two weeks of antibiotic therapy. Anticoagulation is contraindicated because, usually, they are associated with superimposed microhemorrhages. However, current recommendations are to start anticoagulation seven days after a stroke. - Non-infective endocarditis such as marantic endocarditis\n- Valvular calcifications: Native valvular calcification, particularly of the mitral valve, increases the risk of developing a cardioembolic stroke. Mitral annular calcification correlates with a relative risk of 2.1 for the development of embolic stroke. - Mechanical prosthetic heart valves have a stroke rate of 2% to 4%, even in patients maintained on oral anticoagulation. Permanent anticoagulation with an INR between 2.5-3.5 is mandatory. Bioprosthetic heart valves have a lower risk of stroke, and aspirin is recommended unless the patient has atrial fibrillation. - Mitral valve prolapse has a low risk of stroke, and anticoagulation is not recommended. However, long-term aspirin is recommended. - Structural and functional ventricular diseases:\n- Ventricular aneurysms\n- Septal aneurysms\n- General ventricular hypokinesia (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction): The annual rate of stroke in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is approximately 2%, with a direct correlation between the risk of a stroke, and the degree of ventricular compromise. - Myocardial infarction: The occurrence of myocardial infarction increases the risk of the development of a stroke, with the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, the presence of a ventricular aneurysm or mural thrombus, and the presence of arrhythmias significantly influencing the degree of risk. Approximately 2.5% of cases will develop a stroke within the first four weeks of the infarction, and nearly 10% will over six years."

    "text": "Approximately 2.5% of cases will develop a stroke within the first four weeks of the infarction, and nearly 10% will over six years. Pathophysiology\nAs with any thrombus, the fundamental pathophysiology is vested within Virchow's triad. Stasis of blood, as occurs with ventricular akinesia or aneurysms, predisposes to thrombus formation. Similarly, the lack of atrial contractility in atrial fibrillation results in an increased predisposition to clot formation, particularly in the left atrial appendage. These thrombi can either remain indolent and later undergo organization or embolize to systemic circulation - stroke is a potential consequence. With atrial fibrillation, this risk is greatest when converting a patient back to sinus rhythm.\nThe endothelial injury that accompanies valvular lesions also predisposes to hypercoagulability and thrombus formation, with similar potential consequences.\nThe cardiac emboli may consist of cholesterol, thrombus, platelet thrombi, calcium, or even bacterial clumps. Emboli from the heart can be distributed anywhere in the body, but more than 80% migrate to the brain. Of the emboli to the brain, the majority involve the anterior circulation, with only about 20% involving the vertebrobasilar circulation.\nWhen emboli enter the brain, they not only obstruct blood flow but may become detached and migrate further distally. Thus, reperfusion is another form of injury."

Evaluation\n**Cardiac Evaluation**\nThe preliminary cardiac evaluation must be directed towards evaluating both the electrophysiologic status of the heart as well as structural and functional status. As such, workup must include a 12-lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiography for all patients. **Electrophysiologic Assessment**\n- A 12-lead ECG is useful only to the extent of detecting ongoing arrhythmias. Additionally, it may provide useful insight into ventricular myocardial status (evidence of ventricular hypertrophy) as well as indicate prior cardiac ischemic episodes. However, transient arrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, will be missed. - Holter monitoring has now become a part of the baseline evaluation of all cases of suspected cardioembolic strokes. Fundamentally similar to an ECG, it has the same drawback of evaluating the conduction system for a relatively limited period of 24 hours. - Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can record activity for as long as three years. Thus, their utility in clinical practice continues to increase, and their use has helped identify several cases of \"missed\" atrial fibrillation. Also, it is very important to note that a patient on oral anticoagulation with atrial fibrillation has to fall 295 times per year for the risk of traumatic subdural hematoma. **Structural and Functional Assessment**\n- Transthoracic echocardiography: Transthoracic echocardiography forms the cornerstone of cardiac evaluation. Ventricular hypo- or akinesia, aneurysms, as well as most valvular lesions, can be identified. However, aA key limitation is that visualization of the left atrial appendage is rarely possible using this imaging modality. - Transesophageal echocardiography: The transesophageal approach permits the use of higher-frequency probes that provide a significantly higher image resolution, and permit visualization of very minute pathologies, including intra-valvar abscesses."

An echocardiogram may detect the following pathologies:\n- Atrial septal defect\n- Patent foramen ovale\n- Atrial septal aneurysm\n- Atrial thrombus\n- Atrial myxoma\n- Aortic arch thrombi\n- Mitral valve vegetations\n**Neurologic Evaluation**\nAlthough the imaging modality of choice will differ based on the time of presentation of the patient (i.e., within the window period or outside it), the following principles govern the process of evaluation:\n- Parenchymal assessment:\n- MRI scans are, by far, the best available imaging modality to evaluate neural parenchymal status. The increasingly available 3 Tesla devices provide an unrivaled image resolution. Various imaging sequences help not only delineate the infarcted area but also help provide a temporal frame where history is sketchy. For instance, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help identify even hyper-acute infarcts by selecting the appropriate b-value. The presence of cortical stroke in multiple vascular territories should give suspicion for a cardioembolic etiology. The appearance of an infarct in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence indicates that the infarct has developed, at least partially, over 6 hours back. MRI scans can even accurately detect hemorrhagic infarcts by means of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Key limitations, however, are the relatively long duration required for the scan - a formidable contraindication in hemodynamically unstable patients - and ensuring compliance in claustrophobic patients. The increasing availability of \"open MRIs\" and \"virtual-reality based systems\" help alleviate the latter, but the former remains a major problem. - CT scans: CT scans are excellent imaging modalities for detecting or ruling out hemorrhage. Rapid imaging and ease of reporting, even in settings with limited expertise, remain its key redeeming features. That said, it shows limited sensitivity in detecting infarcts early on in their evolution."

Treatment / Management\nThe cornerstone of the management of cardioembolic strokes involves the use of anticoagulants for secondary prevention. However, the exact timing of the initiation of anticoagulation remains a matter of controversy. The intention is to strike a delicate balance between the risk of recurrence on the one hand and the risk of a hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct on the other. Current guidelines propose an arbitrary deferral of anticoagulation for two weeks after the event, based on the extrapolation of trials based on heparin use. Conventionally, vitamin K antagonists like warfarin are used for oral anticoagulation. Therapeutic response is monitored by serial assessment of prothrombin time and the international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The target INR is between 2.0 to -3.0. However, this target is scaled up to 2.5 to 3.5 for cases with metallic mitral valves. Although universally available and inexpensive, a poorly predictable dose-response curve, a penchant for drug interactions, and a heavy dependence on patient dietary compliance are key drawbacks of these agents. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent the new generation of oral anticoagulants that overcome the shortcomings of vitamin K antagonists. Available agents include apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban. These newer agents are believed to have a more predictable dose-response curve, and their use obviates the need for repeated monitoring. A key drawback of these DOACs was the lack of availability of a reversal agent; however, this is no longer always the case. Reversal agents for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and rivaroxaban and apixaban (recombinant factor Xa - andexanet alfa) have received FDA approval and are available for clinical use."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nCardioembolic stroke is a devastating disease with a high risk of recurrence and complications if it is not identified and treated properly. The treatment involves multiple levels of evaluation, drugs, and therapy to optimize patient recovery. An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists is needed to treat these patients effectively.\nMost hospitals have an interprofessional team dedicated to the management of patients with stroke. This stroke team consisting of a cardiologist, a neurologist, a dedicated radiologist (potentially an interventional neuro-radiologist if thrombectomy is warranted), and an internal medicine physician, is vital in improving outcomes. The clinicians need to maintain a high degree of suspicion for underlying arrhythmias or cardiac diseases that can lead to an embolic etiology of the stroke. Due diligence with thorough evaluation is warranted to rule out this disease.\nIn addition, a stroke nurse is needed to monitor the patient's neurologic status during the hospital stay and to assist the medical team in educating the patient to prevent a recurrence. The clinical pharmacist is needed to assist the team in educating the patient on drug compliance and to adjust medications to minimize adverse outcomes. An integrative and collaborative interprofessional team can greatly improve outcomes for patients with this disease. [Level V]\nCurrent evidence regarding when to initiate treatment is still sketchy. Trials such as the TIMING study are likely to add valuable information to the existing knowledge base."

Introduction\nAcute stroke is frequently referred to as a cerebrovascular accident; however, it is essential to note that a stroke is not an accidental event. A more accurate and meaningful term to describe it is \"brain attack,\" which carries a similar significance to \"heart attack.\" However, stroke encompasses a broader range of variations than heart disease. Stroke is categorized into mainly 2 types: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic strokes are further divided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), more specifically, nontraumatic (spontaneous) ICH and nontraumatic (spontaneous aneurysmal) SAH. Ischemic strokes occur when there is a blockage in a blood vessel, resulting in a restricted blood supply to the brain. In contrast, hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel ruptures, causing blood to leak into the intracranial cavity. The American Heart Association/The American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) provides a comprehensive definition of stroke. In its simplest form, stroke is an acute episode of focal neurological dysfunction that persists for more than 24 hours. Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death worldwide and is a major contributor to disability. Stroke imposes a considerable financial burden due to the costs associated with prehospital, hospital, and posthospital care. Understanding that the potential for achieving a complete neurological recovery diminishes with every minute of untreated acute stroke is essential. This forms the \"time is brain\" concept foundation, emphasizing the critical importance of timely evaluation and management of an acute stroke. Early and targeted treatments, rehabilitation programs, and long-term lifestyle modifications can significantly enhance clinical outcomes for individuals with an acute stroke."

Early and targeted treatments, rehabilitation programs, and long-term lifestyle modifications can significantly enhance clinical outcomes for individuals with an acute stroke. Etiology\n**Ischemic Stroke**\nIschemic stroke exhibits significant heterogeneity, with more than 100 implicated pathologies. The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system identifies 3 primary causes of ischemic stroke: large vessel disease, small vessel disease (lacunar), and cardioembolism. Large vessel disease encompasses conditions such as atherosclerosis, arterial dissection, and artery-to-artery embolism. When major arteries experience thrombotic or embolic occlusion, specific syndromes can manifest due to reduced blood flow to particular brain regions, which correlates with corresponding examination findings. Large vessels comprise intracranial arteries (including the circle of Willis and its proximal branches) and extracranial arteries (including common carotid, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries). Lacunar strokes, predominantly caused by small vessel diseases, are commonly associated with lipohyalinosis and atherosclerosis. Lipohyalinosis refers to the concentric hyaline thickening of small cerebral vessels leading to the occlusion of penetrating arteries. Atherosclerotic plaques in parent arteries, particularly involving the ostium of perforating branches, can also result in occlusion. Furthermore, microatheromas have the potential to obstruct small penetrating arteries. Cardioembolism, as a cause of stroke, can stem from various sources, including arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, bioprosthetic and mechanical heart valves, and cardiomyopathy. Ischemic stroke is primarily associated with several key risk factors, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, arrhythmia, and cardiac disease. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)**\nICH stands as the second most prevalent form of stroke. ICH is typically caused by the rupture of small arteries, often due to hypertensive vasculopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), coagulopathies, and other vasculopathies. Hypertensive vasculopathy is predominantly associated with non-lobar ICH (in regions such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem), whereas CAA is more commonly linked to lobar ICH."

Hypertensive vasculopathy is predominantly associated with non-lobar ICH (in regions such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem), whereas CAA is more commonly linked to lobar ICH. Pathophysiology\n**Ischemic Stroke**\nThe pathophysiology of ischemic stroke begins with insufficient blood supply to a focal area of brain tissue. Within minutes, the central core of tissue in this affected area progresses toward irreversible damage, known as the area of infarction. However, the surrounding tissue, referred to as the penumbra, does not experience immediate cell death and has the potential for recovery if early reperfusion is achieved. In regions of reduced blood flow, there is an imbalance between the consumption and production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in diminished energy stores. This leads to ionic imbalances, electrical disturbances, and a cascade of ischemia-related changes. These changes increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Over time, the pathophysiological cascade destroys cell membranes, cell lysis, and cell death through mechanisms such as necrosis or apoptosis. Following ischemic stroke, microglia are swiftly activated in the affected ischemic area and extend to the penumbra region. Their activation peaks 48 to 72 hours after the stroke onset and can persist for several weeks. Activated microglia cause an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as ROS, NO, interleukin-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. However, they also release anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor. The intricate ischemic cascade triggered by acute stroke ultimately leads to the loss of neurons and supporting structures. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)**\nAfter the rupture of small arteries due to hypertensive changes, CAA, coagulopathies, and other vasculopathies, the primary injury mechanisms in ICH involve the expanding hematoma's mass effect and perihematomal edema."

The growing hematoma volume and edema contribute to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), potentially reducing cerebral perfusion and ischemic injury. In addition, patients are also at risk of experiencing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and herniation. Similar to ischemic stroke, ICH also undergoes subsequent proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phases. Secondary mechanisms of injury (such as blood-related cytotoxicity, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress) disrupt the blood-brain barrier, resulting in significant brain cell death and the development of potentially life-threatening brain edema. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**\nA cerebral aneurysm, when ruptured, is the primary cause of SAH. However, it's noteworthy that brain injury arising from a cerebral aneurysm can occur without an actual rupture. Compressive forces exerted by the aneurysm can damage local brain tissue and compromise the blood supply to distal areas. When an aneurysm ruptures, arterial blood is released into the subarachnoid space, rapidly disseminating through the cerebrospinal fluid and increasing ICP. The arterial blood can also extend into the intraventricular space and brain parenchyma. Secondary brain injury can occur due to several factors, including ICH, IVH, ICP, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, or delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI)."

History and Physical\nA rapid, focused history and physical examination are essential for evaluating a patient presenting with acute-onset focal neurological dysfunction. These initial steps are crucial in differentiating acute stroke from stroke mimics and determining the etiology (whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic, including the subtype). Although statistics may vary, common ischemic stroke mimics include hypoglycemia, seizure, and migraine. **Ischemic Stroke**\nIdeally, a patient's history should include information about when they were last known to be well, the understanding of onset, any risk factors, medications, and other relevant details regarding a possible underlying illness. Along with assessing vital signs, conducting a targeted neurological examination using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is advisable. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)**\nAlthough ICH most commonly occurs during routine activities, it can also occur during sexual intercourse or other physical activities. Neurological symptoms tend to worsen over minutes to a few hours progressively. During hospitalization, neurological deterioration is frequently observed due to the expansion of the hematoma and its associated consequences. The clinical presentation of ICH varies depending on the size and location of the hemorrhage, with prevalent symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and headache. Seizures typically occur at the onset of bleeding or within 24 hours. The incidence of acute seizures during the first 24 to 72 hours ranges from 4% to 42%. Without neuroimaging, no clinical decision scale can differentiate ICH from other highly sensitive or specific conditions. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**\nSimilar to ICH, aneurysmal SAH usually occurs during routine activity, including rest or sleep, but it can also occur during physical activity."

Evaluation\nNeuroimaging is a critical component of stroke management, with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being the primary modalities. According to the 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), it is recommended that all patients suspected of experiencing acute stroke should undergo emergency brain imaging evaluation upon arrival at the hospital before initiating any specific therapy to treat AIS. Noncontrast CT (NCCT) and MRI are considered appropriate modalities to exclude ICH before administering intravenous (IV) alteplase. In cases where a patient with AIS presents within 6 hours of symptom onset and shows a small core infarct on NCCT, it is recommended to use CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) for guiding mechanical thrombectomy patient selection. Conversely, when a patient with AIS presents within the 6- to 24-hour window following symptom onset and displays a large-vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation, it is recommended to use diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) with or without MR perfusion or CT perfusion for evaluation. For patients experiencing a \"wake-up\" stroke or with an uncertain time of symptom onset, obtaining an MRI is crucial in identifying diffusion-positive fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-negative lesions. This imaging technique assists in determining whether the patient would benefit from thrombolytic therapy. In patients diagnosed with ICH, performing a CTA within the first few hours of symptom onset can help identify individuals at risk of experiencing hematoma expansion (HE). Furthermore, serial head CT scans within the first 24 hours can assess for any HE. The diagnosis of SAH is primarily based on NCCT imaging. A lumbar puncture is recommended if the CT scan yields negative results despite a high clinical suspicion."

However, it is not recommended for nonhypoxic patients. - Blood pressure (BP): Patients with elevated BP should have their BP carefully reduced to a systolic BP (SBP) below 185 mm Hg and diastolic BP below 110 mm Hg before initiating IV fibrinolytic therapy. Following the treatment, the BP should be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours. Suppose a mechanical thrombectomy is planned, and the patient has not received IV fibrinolytic therapy. In that case, it is reasonable to maintain their BP at or below 185/110 mm Hg before the procedure and at or below 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure. - Temperature: In patients with AIS, hyperthermia (body temperature >38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F) should be addressed by administering antipyretic medication. - Blood glucose: Both hypoglycemia (blood glucose level \\<60 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels within the range of 140 to 180 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS. - IV alteplase: IV alteplase is recommended for patients with AIS at a dosage of 0.9 mg/kg, with the initial 10% given as a bolus over 1 minute (maximum dosage is 90 mg over 60 minutes)."

Eligible patients include those who meet the criteria within 3 hours or 3 to 4.5 hours of AIS witnessed symptom onset or when the patient was last known well or at baseline. The exact dosage can be administered within 4.5 hours to patients with AIS who awaken with stroke symptoms or have an unclear time of onset greater than 4.5 hours from when they were last known well or at baseline, and also for patients who have a DW-MRI lesion smaller than one-third of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and no visible signal change on FLAIR. To mitigate the risk of bleeding, abciximab should not be administered concurrently with IV alteplase; IV aspirin should not be administered within 90 minutes after initiating IV alteplase; and IV alteplase should not be administered within 24 hours after a total treatment dosage of low-molecular-weight heparin. - Other IV fibrinolytics: In patients without contraindications who are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy, a single IV bolus of tenecteplase at 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) can be administered instead of IV alteplase. However, IV defibrinogenating or IV fibrinolytic agents, other than alteplase and tenecteplase, are not recommended. - Mechanical thrombectomy: Patients eligible for IV alteplase should receive it, even if mechanical thrombectomy is being considered. However, if a patient fulfills all 6 of the following criteria, they should undergo mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever or direct aspiration: (1) pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1; (2) AIS caused by an occlusion in the internal carotid artery or MCA segment 1 (M1); (3) age 18 or older; (4) NIHSS score of 6 or higher; (5) Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 6 or higher; and (6) treatment can be initiated within 6 hours of symptom onset."

These patients must exhibit LVO in the anterior circulation and meet additional criteria according to the DAWN or DEFUSE 3 trials. - Antiplatelet treatment: Aspirin administration is recommended within 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset. However, aspirin administration is typically delayed until 24 hours after treating a patient with IV alteplase. For patients diagnosed with minor, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke who have not received IV alteplase, it is appropriate to initiate dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel within 24 hours after symptom onset. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**\nInitiating treatment for elevated BP within 2 hours of ICH onset and achieving the target BP within 1 hour may reduce HE risk and improve outcomes. In patients with mild-to-moderate ICH and an initial SBP between 150 and 220 mm Hg, the target SBP is 140 mm Hg to maintain the SBP between 130 and 150 mm Hg. It is noteworthy that if these patients present with an initial SBP above 150 mm Hg, rapidly lowering the SBP to below 130 mm Hg may cause potential harm. Anticoagulation should be discontinued immediately in patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH, and rapid reversal should be performed as soon as possible. Platelet transfusion may be considered in patients treated with aspirin who require emergency neurosurgery. However, platelet transfusion should not be administered for patients treated with aspirin who do not require emergency neurosurgery due to potentially harmful effects. Surgical management has reduced mortality for specific patients compared to medical management alone. Surgical options for managing ICH include minimally invasive hematoma evacuation with endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration, external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion, and craniotomy."

The ESO recommends intervention within 72 hours after symptom onset. However, a recent meta-analysis on the timing of endovascular treatment in SAH indicates a lack of evidence regarding the optimal timing in SAH patients. Short-term antifibrinolytic therapy was considered a strategy to reduce the rebleeding risk; however, the routine use of tranexamic acid after SAH cannot be recommended. Between the onset of SAH symptoms and the obliteration of the aneurysm, AHA/ASA recommends maintaining SBP below 160 mm Hg. On the contrary, ESO suggests maintaining the SBP below 180 mm Hg until the ruptured aneurysm has been coiled or clipped. Complete obliteration of the aneurysm is the recommended goal, with endovascular coiling being the preferred treatment when a ruptured aneurysm is considered suitable for either coiling or clipping. In case of a patient experiencing a seizure associated with SAH, treatment with antiepileptic drugs is recommended. Short-term seizure prophylaxis may also be considered during the immediate posthemorrhagic period. Depending on the clinical situation, the management of hydrocephalus involves diverting cerebrospinal fluid through methods such as EVD or lumbar drainage. Nimodipine should be administered to all patients to prevent DCI, with oral administration preferred over IV administration. Additional treatment goals include pain control, euvolemia, normothermia, and normoglycemia."

Prognosis\nThe results and conclusions of the following studies highlight the significant impact of acute stroke, irrespective of its type or subtype, and emphasize the importance of collaborative efforts to improve acute stroke care, secondary prevention, and subsequent long-term prognoses. According to the 2019 systematic analysis of stroke for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, there was a significant increase in the annual number of strokes (ischemic, ICH, SAH, and all types of strokes combined) and deaths attributed to stroke between 1990 and 2019. According to a population-based cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom, it was found that 5 years following a first stroke (including ischemic, ICH, SAH, and cases with uncertain type), 47% of patients were deceased, and 39% were living with disabilities. Based on a longitudinal observational study of the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke), it was found that the survival rates differed between patients with ischemic stroke and those with ICH. At 30 days after a first stroke, 89.9% of patients with ischemic stroke were alive compared to 69.3% of patients with ICH. Although early mortality was higher for patients diagnosed with ICH, beyond 30 days, survival declined at a similar rate for both groups. However, the proportion of functionally dependent survivors remained consistently higher for patients with ICH at all time points. The study found that at 5 years, the survival rate was 49.4% for ischemic stroke and 37.8% for ICH. The authors concluded that 5 years after a first stroke, over 65% of patients with ischemic stroke and over 75% of patients with ICH were either deceased or functionally dependent."

The authors concluded that 5 years after a first stroke, over 65% of patients with ischemic stroke and over 75% of patients with ICH were either deceased or functionally dependent. According to a large national cohort study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, among patients hospitalized with a first stroke (including ischemic stroke, ICH, SAH, and cases with unspecified type), the survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 52.8% and 36.4%, respectively. The study also reported a cumulative incidence of stroke recurrence of 19.8% at 5 years and 26.8% at 10 years. In a population-based study conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on patients aged 18 to 49 who survived for at least 30 days after experiencing a first stroke (including ischemic stroke, ICH, and stroke not otherwise specified), it was observed that the risk of mortality remained elevated compared to the general population for up to 15 years following the stroke. In a population-based cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom, it was observed that the rate of stroke recurrence within 5 years decreased from 18% among individuals who experienced a stroke (including ischemic, ICH, and SAH) between 1995 and 1999 to 12% among those who had a stroke between 2000 and 2005. However, there has been no further reduction in stroke recurrence rates since 2005. A study using Danish Nationwide Health registries revealed that overall recurrence risks following a first ischemic stroke were 4% at 1 year and 13% at 10 years. For the first ICH, the corresponding risks were 3% at 1 year and 12% at 10 years. Moreover, the all-cause mortality risks after a first ischemic stroke were 17% at 1 year and 56% at 10 years, which increased to 25% at 1 year and 70% at 10 years after a recurrent stroke. As for ICH, the all-cause mortality risks were 37% at 1 year and 70% at 10 years after a first stroke, rising to 31% at 1 year and 75% at 10 years after a recurrent stroke."

Clinicians must be prepared to treat these potential emergent adverse effects before drug administration.\nLarge territorial infarcts can be complicated by brain edema, and depending on the severity, surgical treatment may be required (decompressive surgery has been shown to reduce mortality).\nRecurrent seizures after stroke should be treated similarly to when they occur with other acute neurological conditions. Prophylactic use of antiseizure drugs is not recommended.\n**Intracerebral Hemorrhage**\nEarly identification and prevention of acute medical complications are essential in the first hours and days after ICH. Standardized protocols, including order sets, are recommended to reduce disability and mortality. Additional recommendations include a formal dysphagia screening before initiating oral intake to reduce disability and the risk of pneumonia; hyperpyrexia treatment with antipyretics, standard cooling blankets, water-circulating surface cooling, or catheter-based cooling devices, and; glucose monitoring and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.\n**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**\nSecondary brain injury can occur due to ICH, IVH, ICP, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, or DCI.\nMedical complications are common and significantly impact outcomes. Reported complications include pyrexia, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac dysfunction, anemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and deep venous thrombosis.

Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care\nRehabilitative therapies are essential within the interdisciplinary team for facilitating a return to activities of daily living and enhancing the overall quality of life during the post-stroke recovery process. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the optimal timing and intensity of rehabilitation services. Some research suggests that very early mobilization (beginning within 24 hours of stroke onset) may harm outcomes and increase the risk of blood pressure-related issues and falls. Nevertheless, further research is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this matter.\nResearch suggests therapy services should ideally begin within 2 weeks of stroke onset. These services typically include physical, occupational, and speech therapies depending on the specific deficits observed. The primary goals of therapy services include fall prevention, enhancing gait and balance function, contracture and pressure ulcer prevention, return to activities of daily living, and improvement of dysarthria and aphasia, as appropriate to each respective discipline. Mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, task-specific training, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and cognitive therapeutic exercises are commonly used treatment approaches for addressing stroke-related deficits. Furthermore, transcutaneous electrical stimulation and taping or strapping techniques are used for managing post-stroke shoulder pain. However, further research is necessary to establish optimal rehabilitation approaches across the post-stroke recovery spectrum, as existing research often lacks conclusive evidence or is based on small sample sizes."

Deterrence and Patient Education\nAcute stroke is both preventable and treatable. Prevention can be accomplished by raising awareness and spreading knowledge of risk factors and warning signs. Public education programs targeting diverse populations, aimed at recognizing the early signs and symptoms of acute stroke and seeking timely emergency care, have proven effective in reducing the time to diagnosis and treatment.\nModifiable risk factors for stroke include physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, diet and nutrition, hypertension (considered the most important and well-documented), obesity, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, modifications in diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and pharmacotherapy treatment for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and at-risk individuals with AF are essential to acute stroke prevention. Also, to predict stroke risk and guide primary stroke prevention treatment in patients with AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended.\nStroke is a significant complication associated with sickle cell disease (SCD), particularly in early childhood. Most SCD-related strokes tend to occur in patients with homozygous SCD, making this population a primary target for stroke prevention strategies.\nFollowing an acute stroke, patients should be provided with comprehensive information, counseling, and the opportunity to discuss the impact of stroke on their lives. In addition, caregivers should receive education, support, and training to enhance the quality of life for the patient and themselves."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nInterprofessional and multidisciplinary teamwork is necessary to promptly identify and treat patients with acute stroke and provide effective care throughout the recovery and rehabilitation process. Guidelines for ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH recommend the importance of interprofessional healthcare teams in prehospital and hospital settings to enhance outcomes. Moreover, rehabilitation services provided by a multidisciplinary team during and after hospitalization are essential in facilitating functional recovery in patients and promoting patient independence for individuals who have experienced an acute stroke. The prehospital team usually comprises the Emergency Medical Services and paramedic personnel, with support from the emergency department (ED) clinicians. During the hyperacute phase (first 72 hours post-stroke), essential team members comprise a stroke clinician, a stroke specialist nurse collaborating with ED personnel, and an imaging team led by a radiologist or neuroradiologist. Pharmacists play a crucial role in interprofessional critical care for stroke patients by providing invaluable expertise in recommending appropriate thrombolytic therapy. Their unique position allows them to assess the safety and appropriateness of these medications for individual patients, ensuring accurate dosing and safe preparation. Pharmacists also contribute to medication reconciliation by adequately managing the patient's medications throughout treatment. They also offer vital counseling to patients by guiding them throughout their treatment regimen. When alerted by a Code: Stroke call, a stroke clinician and specialist nurse commonly attend the ED. Stroke survivors should be directly admitted from the ED to specialized stroke inpatient units to enhance outcomes. This practice reduces mortality rates and promotes increased patient independence during the inpatient stay. Due to its proven benefits, initiating rehabilitation as early as possible following a stroke is recommended."

In addition to their role in the team, stroke coordinators may contribute to secondary stroke prevention education by working alongside other team members to provide crucial information and support. Early supported discharge (ESD) for stroke refers to an interprofessional team intervention designed to enable timely hospital discharge and the provision of stroke-specialized rehabilitation in the patient's home. Internationally, stroke care guidelines recommend ESD services, which initiate treatment within 24 hours of hospital discharge, as an integral component of evidence-based stroke care. The interprofessional care model, utilizing open communication channels among all care team members, will help achieve optimal patient outcomes for individuals with acute stroke."

Introduction\nAcute stroke is the acute onset of focal neurological deficits in a vascular territory affecting the brain, retina, or spinal cord due to underlying cerebrovascular diseases. Stroke is prevalent across patient populations and can significantly cause morbidity and mortality. Strokes are categorized as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic strokes can further be classified as intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among ischemic strokes, the Trial Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification is used to subdivide the categories that include the following:\n- Cardioembolism\n- Small vessel occlusion\n- Large artery atherosclerosis\n- Stroke of undetermined etiology\n- Stroke of other determined etiology (possible or probable depending on the results of ancillary studies)\nA crucial aspect of classification involves the physician's ability to designate a specific subtype diagnosis as probable or possible, depending on the level of certainty. A diagnosis is considered \"probable\" when clinical findings, neuroimaging data, and results of diagnostic studies align with a particular subtype, and other potential causes have been ruled out. On the other hand, a diagnosis is labeled as \"possible\" when clinical findings and neuroimaging data suggest a specific subtype, but additional studies have not been conducted. Given that many patients undergo a limited number of diagnostic tests, the categorizations of probable and possible allow the physician to establish as precise a subgroup diagnosis as possible."

    "text": "Given that many patients undergo a limited number of diagnostic tests, the categorizations of probable and possible allow the physician to establish as precise a subgroup diagnosis as possible. Etiology\nThe etiology of ischemic stroke is a thrombotic or embolic event that causes an impairment of blood flow to an area of the brain. In a thrombotic event, the blood flow to the brain is obstructed within the blood vessel due to a thrombus (clot) within the vessel itself, usually secondary to atherosclerotic disease, arterial dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, or inflammatory conditions. In an embolic event, debris from elsewhere in the body blocks blood flow through the affected vessel. The source of emboli can be the proximal artery, such as an atherosclerotic plaque in the internal carotid artery, causing an artery-to-artery embolic stroke distally from any proximal source, commonly from the heart. Occasionally, the source may be from the right side of the circulation, going through a right-to-left shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale, towards the cerebral arterial system. The etiology of stroke affects both prognosis and outcomes. **Cardioembolism:** This group comprises patients with arterial blockages likely caused by an embolism originating in the heart. Cardiac sources are categorized into high-risk and medium-risk groups based on their propensity for embolism. At least 1 cardiac source of an embolus must be identified to consider a possible or probable diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke. Clinical and brain imaging findings resemble those described for large-artery atherosclerosis. Evidence of a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke in more than 1 vascular territory or systemic embolisms supports a clinical diagnosis of cardiogenic stroke. Possible large artery atherosclerotic sources of thrombosis or embolism should be ruled out. A stroke occurring in a patient with a medium-risk cardiac source of embolism and no other apparent cause of stroke is categorized as a possible cardioembolic stroke."

A stroke occurring in a patient with a medium-risk cardiac source of embolism and no other apparent cause of stroke is categorized as a possible cardioembolic stroke. **Large artery atherosclerosis:** These patients will exhibit clinical and brain imaging findings indicating either significant (> 50%) narrowing or complete blockage of a major brain artery or branch cortical artery, likely due to atherosclerosis. Clinical manifestations may include symptoms of cerebral cortical impairment (eg, aphasia, neglect, or limited motor function) or dysfunction of the brainstem or cerebellum. The presence of intermittent claudication history, TIAs in the same vascular territory, a carotid bruit, or weakened pulses can aid in confirming the clinical diagnosis. Lesions in the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, or subcortical hemispheric infarctions larger than 1.5 cm in diameter observed on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate potential large artery atherosclerotic origin. Additional supportive evidence through duplex imaging or arteriography demonstrating more than 50% stenosis of a relevant intracranial or extracranial artery is necessary. Diagnostic evaluations should rule out potential sources of cardiogenic embolism. A diagnosis of stroke attributed to large artery atherosclerosis cannot be established if duplex or arteriographic studies appear normal or only reveal minimal changes. **Small vessel occlusion:** This category encompasses patients with strokes commonly classified as lacunar infarcts in other systems. Patients in this group should present with 1 of the typical clinical lacunar syndromes and should not exhibit signs of cerebral cortical dysfunction. A history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension supports the clinical diagnosis. Additionally, patients should have normal CT scan or MRI findings or demonstrate a relevant brainstem or subcortical hemisphere lesion with a diameter of \\<1.5 cm. The absence of potential cardiac sources for embolism is expected, and evaluation of the major extracranial arteries should not reveal stenosis >50% in an artery on the same side. **Stroke of undetermined etiology:** In numerous cases, determining the cause of a stroke proves challenging. Some patients undergo extensive evaluation yet yield no likely etiology. Others undergo only a cursory evaluation, resulting in an undetermined cause."

Others undergo only a cursory evaluation, resulting in an undetermined cause. Epidemiology\nIn 2021, stroke accounted for 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease, with someone in the US experiencing a stroke every 40 seconds, resulting in a stroke-related death every 3 minutes and 14 seconds. Annually, over 795,000 Americans suffer from a stroke, of which approximately 610,000 are initial occurrences. Nearly a quarter of these strokes, roughly 185,000 cases, occur in individuals with a history of previous strokes. Ischemic strokes, blocking blood flow to the brain, constitute about 87% of all strokes. According to the Framingham Heart Study, stroke incidence has declined. However, the cohort was predominantly a White population.\nThe financial burden of stroke in the US amounted to nearly $56.5 billion between 2018 and 2019, covering healthcare expenses, medication, and lost productivity due to missed workdays. Stroke stands as a primary contributor to severe long-term disability, particularly affecting mobility in over half of stroke survivors aged 65 and older.\nDisparities in stroke incidence and outcomes exist across racial and ethnic groups, with non-Hispanic Black adults facing nearly twice the risk of a first stroke compared to White adults, and both non-Hispanic Black and Pacific Islander adults exhibiting the highest stroke-related mortality rates. Moreover, the death rate attributed to stroke rose from 38.8 per 100,000 in 2020 to 41.1 per 100,000 in 2021."

Pathophysiology\nIn thrombosis, an obstructive process prevents blood flow to regions of the brain. The most common risk factor is large vessel atherosclerosis. Other risk factors include vasculitides and arterial dissection. Embolic events occur when a clot originates from another location in the body. Most commonly, the clot's source is the heart's valve or chambers, for example, when a clot forms within the atria in atrial fibrillation and dislodges into the arterial vascular supply. Less frequent sources include venous, septic, air, or fat emboli. Lacunar infarcts are usually seen in the subcortical areas of the brain supplied by small penetrating or perforating arteries, usually without collaterals. These include the lenticulostriate arteries from the middle cerebral artery, the thalamic perforators from the posterior cerebral artery, and the paramedian branches from the basilar artery. The underlying pathology of these penetrating arteries is small vessel arteriolosclerosis caused by hypertension, aging, smoking, diabetes, and other conventional vascular risk factors. **Cerebral Autoregulation**\nUnder physiological conditions, cerebral blood flow is primarily regulated by the resistance within the cerebral blood vessels, which correlates directly with their diameter. Vasodilation results in increased blood volume within the brain and heightened cerebral blood flow, while vasoconstriction produces the opposite effect. Additionally, cerebral blood flow is influenced by fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral autoregulation denotes the ability to maintain relatively stable cerebral blood flow despite moderate shifts in perfusion pressure. The precise mechanisms underlying autoregulation remain incompletely understood and likely involve multiple pathways. Evidence suggests that the smooth muscle in cerebral vessels reacts directly to changes in perfusion pressure by contracting with pressure elevation and relaxing with pressure reduction. Furthermore, decreases in cerebral blood flow may prompt blood vessel dilation by releasing vasoactive substances, although the specific molecules responsible have yet to be identified."

Furthermore, decreases in cerebral blood flow may prompt blood vessel dilation by releasing vasoactive substances, although the specific molecules responsible have yet to be identified. Nitric oxide released by endothelial cells also appears to contribute to autoregulation. Ordinarily, cerebral blood flow regulation through autoregulation operates within a mean arterial pressure (MAP) range of 60 to 150 mmHg, albeit with individual variations in upper and lower limits. Beyond this range, the brain's ability to compensate for perfusion pressure changes diminishes, causing cerebral blood flow to rise or fall passively in response to pressure fluctuations. This passive response poses a risk of ischemia at low pressures and edema at high pressures. During certain pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke, cerebral autoregulation becomes impaired. As cerebral perfusion pressure declines, cerebral blood vessels dilate to augment cerebral blood flow. However, if the decrease in perfusion pressure exceeds the brain's compensatory capacity, cerebral blood flow diminishes. Initially, an increase in the oxygen extraction fraction occurs to sustain oxygen delivery to the brain. Subsequently, as cerebral blood flow continues to decrease, additional mechanisms come into play. Protein synthesis is inhibited below a cerebral blood flow rate of 50 mL/100 g/min. Protein synthesis ceases altogether at 35 mL/100 g/min, and there is a transient increase in glucose utilization. When cerebral blood flow drops to 25 mL/100 g/min, glucose utilization declines significantly, and anaerobic glycolysis ensues, resulting in tissue acidosis due to lactic acid accumulation. Neuronal electrical failure occurs at a cerebral blood flow of 16 to 18 mL/100 g/min, followed by failure of membrane ion homeostasis at 10 to 12 mL/100 g/min. This threshold typically marks the onset of infarction. In hypertensive individuals, autoregulation adapts to operate at higher arterial pressures. Lowering blood pressure to normal levels in such individuals could exacerbate autoregulation dysfunction during stroke, leading to further reductions in cerebral blood flow. **Concept of the Ischemic Penumbra**\nDuring an acute ischemic stroke, the brain tissue that relies exclusively on 1 artery for its blood supply will suffer an infarct, forming what is known as the infarct core."

    "text": "**Concept of the Ischemic Penumbra**\nDuring an acute ischemic stroke, the brain tissue that relies exclusively on 1 artery for its blood supply will suffer an infarct, forming what is known as the infarct core. Surrounding this core is an area of brain tissue called the ischemic penumbra, which maintains some blood supply through collateral circulation. However, as swelling from the infarction grows, the penumbra diminishes, and the infarct core expands. Under normal conditions, cerebral perfusion is approximately 50 mL/100 g/min. Brain cells begin to die when perfusion drops below 30%, equivalent to \\<15 mL/100 g/min. Hence, when blood flow is reduced but remains above 30% of the normal rate, the brain tissue is ischemic but not infarcted, highlighting the critical principle that \"time is brain.\" This principle underscores the importance of timely revascularization treatments in acute ischemic stroke, given the distinct time windows for intervention based on these physiological insights. **Ischemic Stroke Syndromes**\nIschemic strokes can present in predetermined syndromes due to decreased blood flow to particular areas of the brain that correlate to exam findings\u2014allowing clinicians to predict the site of the brain vasculature that can be affected. **Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Infarction**\nThe MCA is the most common artery involved in stroke (see **Images. ** Left MCA Territory Infarction and Right-Sided MDA 'Cord Sign' Harbingering Acute Infection). The MCA is divided into 4 segments (M1, M2, M3, and M4) and supplies a large area of the lateral surface of the brain, part of the basal ganglia, and the internal capsule. The M1 (horizontal) segment gives off the lenticulostriate arteries, which supply the basal ganglia and internal capsule. The M1 segment continues to the M2 (Sylvian) segment and supplies the insula, superior temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and inferolateral frontal lobe. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke,\" for more information. The MCA distribution involves the lateral cerebral cortex. MCA syndrome is best explained by understanding the homunculus of the cerebral cortex, in which the lateral portion contains motor and sensory functions that involve the face and upper extremities."

MCA syndrome is best explained by understanding the homunculus of the cerebral cortex, in which the lateral portion contains motor and sensory functions that involve the face and upper extremities. MCA infarctions classically present with contralateral hemiparesis, facial paralysis, and sensory loss in the face and upper extremities. The lower extremities may be involved, especially when the deep brain structures are involved, but upper extremity symptoms usually predominate. In addition, gaze preferences towards the side of the lesion may be seen. Additional symptoms include the following:\n- **Dysarthria** is characterized by difficulty phonating due to the physical weakness of the facial muscles. Dysarthria does not have much localizing value in acute stroke, as both cortical and subcortical infarcts can cause dysarthria. Dominant and nondominant hemisphere strokes can also cause dysarthria. The most severe form of dysarthria is anarthria, during which the patient will have no speech output. Dysarthria is often misinterpreted as aphasia. - **Neglect** is when the patient seems to \"ignore\" a hemisphere of their world due to an inability to see that area. Neglect is a nondominant cortical sensory dysfunction. Extinction or inability to perceive double simultaneous stimuli is a bedside test commonly performed for a nondominant cortical lesion. - **Visual field loss** occurs in MCA infarcts because the branches of the MCA supply the optic radiations. A more limited ischemic stroke affecting the parietal lobe may cause contralateral inferior quadrantanopia. In contrast, a limited temporal lobe infarct will result in a contralateral superior quadrantanopia (pie-in-the-sky). - **Aphasia,** or the inability to produce or understand language, is caused by injury to the language areas of the dominant hemisphere of the brain, which are supplied by the dominant MCA. **Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Infarction**\nThe ACA supplies blood to the medial areas of the frontal, prefrontal, primary motor, primary sensory, and supplemental motor cortices. These are areas corresponding to the lower extremities in the cortical homunculus. Pure ACA infarcts are uncommon because of the good collateral blood supply. The sensory and motor cortices receive sensory information and control the contralateral lower extremity movement."

Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Anterior Cerebral Artery Stroke,\" for more information. **Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Infarction**\nThe superficial PCA supplies the occipital lobe and the medial portion of the temporal lobe. The deep PCA supplies the thalamus and other posterior deep structures of the brain. The occipital lobe is the location of the visual cortex. The thalamus is the main relaying center for ascending and descending nervous networks. The most common cause of a PCA infarct is an atherothrombotic lesion in the vertebral artery. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke,\" for more information. PCA infarctions can be divided into deep and superficial categories based on the PCA supply. If the deep segments of the PCA are involved, the symptoms are mainly related to thalamic dysfunction. The symptoms may include hypersomnolence, cognitive deficits, ocular findings, hypoesthesia, and ataxia. Larger infarcts that involve the deep structures can lead to hemisensory loss and hemiparesis due to the involvement of the thalamus and the adjacent internal capsule. Superficial infarcts present mainly with contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often with macular sparing. Rarely, bilateral PCA infarcts present with amnesia and cortical blindness. In many posterior circulation strokes, symptomatology can be subtle; therefore, healthcare providers should have a low index of suspicion and obtain imaging and neurology consultations earlier (see **Image. ** Axial Section on Noncontrast CT Head Shows Left PCA Ischemic Stroke and No Hemorrhage). **Vertebrobasilar Infarction**\nThe vertebrobasilar region of the brain is supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries and the basilar artery as they course the anterior surface of the pons. The vertebral arteries arise from their respective subclavian artery, course through the transverse foramina of the upper 6 cervical vertebrae, and enter the skull through the foramen magnum."

The main branches of each vertebral artery are the posterior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the anterior spinal artery. The vertebral arteries terminate by merging to form the basilar artery. The basilar artery bifurcates into 2 posterior cerebral arteries, which join the circle of Willis. In addition to the paramedian penetrating branches, the basilar artery gives rise to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the superior cerebellar artery. These arteries supply the cerebellum and brainstem. The clinical presentation includes ataxia, vertigo, headache, vomiting, oropharyngeal dysfunction, visual field deficits, and abnormal oculomotor findings. Patterns of clinical presentation vary depending on the location and the infarction pattern of embolism or atherosclerosis. **Cerebellar Infarction**\nPatients may present with ataxia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dysarthria, and vertigo symptoms. In addition, edema and rapid clinical deterioration can complicate cerebellar infarction. **Lacunar Infarction**\nLacunar infarcts result from the occlusion of small perforating or penetrating arteries. By definition, these infarcts are smaller than 1 centimeter in diameter. Lacunar infarction can present with a pure motor or sensory loss, sensorimotor deficit, or ataxic-hemiparesis.

History and Physical\nIschemic strokes manifest suddenly, making it crucial to determine the time when symptoms first appeared. If the exact moment of symptom onset is unknown, clinicians use the time the patient was last observed in their usual state of health, free from new neurological symptoms, as a reference point. This established timeline is critical for deciding the appropriateness of administering intravenous (IV) thrombolytics. Another vital aspect of the clinical assessment involves investigating potential underlying causes to anticipate the stroke's mechanism. Factors to consider include common vascular risk factors such as hypertension, a history of stroke or TIAs, smoking, and diabetes. Additionally, a history of cardiac diseases, notably atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy, should be ascertained by the treating clinician. Factors like a history of neck injury, recent chiropractic manipulations, and signs of hypercoagulopathy also play a significant role in the evaluation. A neurological examination is crucial for all patients suspected of having a stroke. Monitoring vital signs and heart rhythms is essential, as is listening for a neck bruit, which can indicate vascular abnormalities. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [[See NIH Stroke Scale]](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/know-stroke/health-professionals/nih-stroke-scale) is the standard tool for assessing stroke severity, featuring 11 categories and scores ranging from 0 to 42. These categories include the level of consciousness (LOC) instructions, LOC questions, LOC commands, gaze direction, vision, facial symmetry, arm and leg motor skills, limb coordination, sensory perception, language abilities, speech clarity, and attention to both sides of the body (see **Table 1. ** National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)."

Evaluation\nAn organized stroke protocol is highly recommended to expedite evaluation. The door-to-needle time of 60 minutes is recommended for acute ischemic stroke patients who qualify for thrombolytics. The goals in the initial phase include the following:\n- Ensuring medical stability, with particular attention to **airway, breathing, and circulation**\n- Quickly reversing any conditions that are contributing to the patient's problem\n- Determining if the patient is a candidate for IV thrombolytic therapy or endovascular thrombectomy\n- Moving toward uncovering the pathophysiologic basis of the patient's neurologic symptoms\nThe initial evaluation of any patient is airway, breathing, circulation, and vital signs. Patients may present with respiratory abnormalities from elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and are at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. A fingerstick glucose check should be performed, as hypoglycemia can easily be ruled out as a cause of neurological abnormalities. A plain CT head is recommended for patients within 20 minutes of presentation to rule out hemorrhage. In stroke centers or hospitals that can provide emergency care, vascular imaging should be considered for possible endovascular intervention. However, endovascular intervention should not delay the administration of thrombolytics. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a specialized MRI technique that measures the diffusion of water molecules within tissue. DWI is particularly sensitive for detecting acute ischemic strokes due to its ability to reveal cytotoxic edema\u2014a hallmark of acute infarction\u2014within minutes after stroke onset. DWI can indicate a brain infarction much earlier than other MRI sequences, such as Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)."

DWI can indicate a brain infarction much earlier than other MRI sequences, such as Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). While a DWI scan can show abnormalities within minutes of a stroke, a FLAIR sequence might take approximately 4.5 hours to reveal signs of a brain infarction. If DWI shows signs of a stroke while the FLAIR sequence does not, it suggests that the ischemic stroke occurred \\<4.5 hours ago. This timing is crucial because patients with strokes \\<4.5 hours old may be eligible for early IV thrombolysis, potentially reversing the neurological deficits. Other diagnostic tests include an electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and coagulation factors. The healthcare provider should evaluate an ECG and troponin because stroke is often associated with coronary artery disease. A CBC may reveal anemia or indicate infection. Healthcare providers should correct electrolyte abnormalities, which can cause altered mental status and could cloud the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. BUN and Cr should be monitored as contrast studies may worsen kidney function. Coagulation factors, including PT, PTT, and INR, should also be drawn as elevated levels may suggest a cause of hemorrhagic stroke. For institutions without expert imaging interpretation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) highly recommends using a teleradiology system for image interpretation for suspected stroke patients. Rapid imaging interpretation assists with the decision to administer IV alteplase. A discussion and agreement between telestroke neurologists and radiologists is highly recommended. In areas that do not have an in-house stroke team or telestroke protocol, a telephone consultation may be considered to administer thrombolytics. The level of evidence for this recommendation is limited."

In areas that do not have an in-house stroke team or telestroke protocol, a telephone consultation may be considered to administer thrombolytics. The level of evidence for this recommendation is limited. Treatment / Management\nThe goal of therapy in acute ischemic stroke is to preserve tissue in areas where perfusion is decreased but sufficient to avoid infarction. Tissue in this area of oligemia is preserved by restoring blood flow to the compromised regions and improving collateral flow. Recanalization strategies include IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy. Restoring blood flow can minimize the effects of ischemia only if performed quickly. The use of endovascular techniques has been used successfully in selected patients to treat acute ischemic stroke. Another consideration is neuroprotective agents, but none have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Essential treatments that have been shown in controlled trials to be efficacious in acute ischemic stroke treatment in different patient groups include the following:\n**Acute Reperfusion Therapy**\n- **IV alteplase (within 4.5 hours of stroke onset):** The American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) recommends IV alteplase (TPA) for patients who satisfy inclusion criteria and have symptom onset or last known baseline within 3 hours. IV TPA should be administered at 0.9 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 90 mg. The first 10% of the dose is given as a bolus over the first minute, and the remainder is given over the next 60 minutes. The time has been extended to 4.5 hours for selected candidates. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of ischemic stroke with \"measurable neurological deficit,\" symptom onset within 3 hours before treatment, and age 18 or older. Healthcare providers should review the exclusion criteria for thrombolytics before administering TPA."

Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of ischemic stroke with \"measurable neurological deficit,\" symptom onset within 3 hours before treatment, and age 18 or older. Healthcare providers should review the exclusion criteria for thrombolytics before administering TPA. According to the FDA, the contraindications to IV thrombolysis include active internal bleeding, recent intracranial surgery or severe head trauma, intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding, bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled hypertension, current intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a history of a recent stroke. Healthcare providers must consider the treatment benefits and risks for patients who present between **3 hours and 4.5 hours** from symptom onset. Additional relative exclusion criteria for this patient category include age older than 80 years, NIHSS >25, oral anticoagulant use, and a history of diabetes and prior ischemic stroke. - **MRI-guided thrombolysis for stroke with unknown time of onset:** Most of these patients wake up with an acute stroke. The patients will be ineligible for IV thrombolytic therapy because their last known normal will be at bedtime. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial used the mismatch between a positive DWI MRI sequence showing an acute ischemic infarction and a negative FLAIR MRI sequence indicating that the infarct occurs within 4.5 hours of the MRI. DWI is positive within 30 minutes of an acute infarct. FLAIR sequence will not be positive until about 4.5 hours after an acute infarct. The mismatch indicates that the stroke occurred within 4.5 hours, and therefore, IV thrombolytic will be indicated. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial confirmed the positive result. - **IV tenecteplase (within 4.5 hours of stroke onset):** Another fibrinolytic agent, tenecteplase (TNK), may be considered an alternative to alteplase. TNK has advantages over TPA with its longer half-life and can be administered as a single Intravascular (IV) dose. TNK can be given at a dose of 30 to 50 mg IV bolus over 5 sec once (based on weight). TNK has become the fibrinolytic agent of choice for many stroke centers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that TNK appeared to have efficacy and safety profiles similar to TPA."

A dose of 0.4 mg/kg, compared to 0.25 mg/kg, showed no advantage. - **Mechanical thrombectomy (within 6 hours of stroke onset):** Mechanical thrombectomy should be considered in all patients, even those who received fibrinolytic therapy. The AHA/ASA guidelines do not recommend observation for a response after IV TPA in patients considered for mechanical thrombectomy. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in acute stroke care. Multiple stroke trials in 2015 showed that endovascular thrombectomy in the first 6 hours is much better than standard medical care in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. These benefits are sustained irrespective of geographical location and patient characteristics. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Acute Stroke,\" for more information. - **Mechanical thrombectomy with perfusion study (within 16 to 24 hours of stroke onset):** Perfusion imaging studies (CT perfusion or MR perfusion) can define the areas of the brain that are ischemic but not infarcted, the ischemic penumbra. Depending on the size of the penumbra relative to the ischemic core, good amounts of brain tissue can be salvaged by restoring blood flow in cases of LVO identified on CT or MR angiogram, resulting in better clinical outcomes. In 2018, a significant paradigm shift occurred in stroke care. The DAWN trial showed significant benefits of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO in the arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. This trial extended the stroke window to 24 hours in selected patients using perfusion imaging. Subsequently, more patients can be treated, even up to 24 hours. Mechanical thrombectomy is recommended within 6 to 16 hours of the last known normal in selected patients with LVO with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and meets other DAWN and DEFUSE 3 criteria."

The patients presented within 24 hours of the last known normal. Their NIHSS score is >6.

These regions are the caudate, putamen, internal capsule, insular cortex, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M6. **Basilar artery occlusion:** This particular type of rare stroke, with about 80% of patients ending up with poor outcomes. AHA guidelines recommend mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of onset. Two large trials published in 2022 demonstrate the benefits of endovascular treatment over conventional therapy. The ATTENTION trial showed the benefits within 12 hours. The BAOCHE trial showed the benefits of thrombectomy 6 to 24 hours after strokes due to basilar artery occlusion.

The 2023 AHA guidelines also recommended that in patients for whom mechanical thrombectomy is planned and who have not received IV fibrinolytic therapy, it is reasonable to maintain BP \u2264185/110 mm Hg before the procedure. A new recommendation is lowering BP initially by 15% in patients with comorbid conditions such as acute heart failure or aortic dissection. Antihypertensive management does not prevent death or dependency in patients with BP \\<220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA and have no comorbid conditions requiring blood pressure reduction. The theoretical risk of BP lowering is the potential reduction of perfusion to the ischemic areas, which is pressure-dependent. The risk applies to the first 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke. For patients with a BP \u2265220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA, the guideline suggests it may be reasonable to reduce BP by 15% in the first 24 hours, although the benefit is uncertain. A large trial recently published showed a U-shaped curve correlating acute MAP and stroke clinical outcomes. The ideal mean systolic BP is 135 mm Hg to 150 mm Hg. Antihypertensive options include the following:\n```\n* Labetalol 10 to 20 mg IV; may repeat once\n* Nicardipine 5 mg/hour IV. Increase 2.5 mg/hour every 5 to 15 minutes.

A retrospective study recently demonstrated an association between a peak temperature >39 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) in the first 24 hours and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. - **Glucose:** Maintain glucose in the 140 to 180 mg/dL range in the first 24 hours. Healthcare providers should treat blood glucose \\<60 mg/dL to achieve normoglycemia. The brain is dependent on oxidative pathways that require glucose for metabolism, and the metabolic demand of the brain is high; therefore, hypoglycemic episodes can decrease the brain's ability to repair. However, hyperglycemia is hypothesized to decrease reperfusion due to the oxidation of nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms and subsequent loss of vascular tone. Moreover, increased acidosis also plays a part, possibly due to injury to lactic acid-sensing channels. Capes et al showed that hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients increases 30-day mortality and is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke conversion. - **Nutrition:** Early enteric feeding should be encouraged. For patients with dysphagia, use a nasogastric tube to promote enteric feeding. If there is concern that the patient may have swallowing difficulties for a prolonged period (more than 2 to 3 weeks), placing a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is recommended. Early feeding has been demonstrated to have an absolute reduction in the risk of death. - **DVT prophylaxis:** Intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended for all immobile patients unless contraindications exist. The European Stroke Organization recommended acutely intermittent pneumatic compression for all immobile stroke patients. They also recommended low-dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis if the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. - **Depression screening:** Screening for depression should be considered after an acute ischemic stroke. Rates of post-stroke depression range from 18% to 33%. Risk factors are female sex, large strokes, a stroke affecting the frontal areas, and poor social support."

Risk factors are female sex, large strokes, a stroke affecting the frontal areas, and poor social support. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the best medications for post-stroke depression. - **Cerebellar/Cerebral edema:** Cerebral edema occurs with acute ischemic stroke, first due to cytotoxic edema with cell swelling, followed by vasogenic edema when the blood-brain barrier is lost. The degree and volume of cerebral edema correlate well with the size of the stroke. Cerebral edema is not significant clinically in lacunar infarction. However, cerebral edema may become symptomatic, resulting in worsening of the stroke symptoms and worse in impairment of consciousness due to herniation. Cerebral edema peaks in 3 to 5 days after an ischemic stroke. Cerebellar edema complicates cerebellar infarctions, and clinicians must know that these patients can rapidly decompensate. The increased ICP can cause obstructing hydrocephalus on the fourth ventricle or cause transtentorial herniation of the superior vermis and downward cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Signs include change or worsening mental status, decreased level of consciousness, respiratory abnormalities, change in pupillary size, posturing, and death. Early recognition and diagnosis of intracranial hypertension due to cerebral edema are essential in caring for acute stroke patients to improve outcomes. Obtain neurosurgical consultation early. A ventriculostomy is indicated in the setting of obstructive hydrocephalus after cerebellar infarct. A decompressive suboccipital craniectomy is highly recommended in cerebellar edema with mass effect cases. - **Seizures:** Post-stroke seizures occur in about 10% of patients, mainly hemorrhagic strokes or cortical infarcts. If the patient experiences a seizure within the first 2 weeks, antiepileptic drugs are indicated for a short period, generally 1 month. Long-term anticonvulsant therapy will be indicated if the seizure occurs later, for weeks or months after a stroke. However, the routine prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs is not recommended as per the newer AHA guidelines on the management of Hemorrhagic stroke as well as the ENLS guidelines. - **Cardiac evaluation:** Cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias is recommended in the first 24 hours."

The benefit of further monitoring after that is unclear. An initial troponin is recommended because there is an association between stroke and coronary artery disease. - **Antiplatelet treatment:** Aspirin is recommended within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset. A Cochrane review concluded that aspirin given within 48 hours of symptom onset for ischemic strokes prevented the recurrence of ischemic strokes and improved long-term outcomes. In addition, there was no significant risk of early intracranial hemorrhage with aspirin. - **Antithrombotic treatment:** Full-dose anticoagulation is not recommended in acute stroke. The main exception is low-dose anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the guidelines state it is reasonable to initiate oral anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after neurological symptoms onset. When to start anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation after acute stroke is always a dilemma; initiation usually depends on factors like stroke size and other comorbidities. Usually, if the stroke size is small to moderate, anticoagulation is started in 7 to 14 days. Sometimes, there are patients with small hemorrhagic transformation after acute stroke, and in this scenario, delay of anticoagulation is warranted. Delay of anticoagulation after hemorrhagic transformation is not associated with excessive stroke recurrence. - **Statins:** High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily) are recommended for patients younger than 75 years with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, patients may be continued on statins if they were on them before the ischemic stroke."

Pearls and Other Issues\nClinical pearls that offer valuable insights into the management and care of patients with ischemic stroke include the following:\n- Have a low threshold for evaluation of stroke, especially in at-risk populations. TIME IS BRAIN!\n- Stroke symptoms depend on the ischemic area of the brain and, therefore, vary.\n- Noncontrast head CT is the first imaging indicated for acute stroke, mainly to rule out hemorrhage.\n- Consider TPA or TNK if thrombotic CVA is identified within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.\n- When indicated, an early CT angiogram or MR angiogram with perfusion study should be obtained to look for LVO and initiate endovascular thrombectomy therapy within 6 to 24 hours.\n- Be aware of presenting blood pressure. Blood pressure management recommendations may include aggressive blood pressure management or permissive hypertension, depending on the type of stroke and whether IV fibrinolytic is indicated.\n- Start an antiplatelet agent within 24 hours of presentation.\n- Consider other risk factor management, including addressing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmias that may increase the risk of vascular disease or a thrombotic event.\n- Consider early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy after the onset of CVA."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe effective management of ischemic stroke demands a cohesive and interprofessional healthcare team dedicated to delivering patient-centered care, improving outcomes, and maximizing safety and team performance. This approach includes physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, neuroimaging technicians, rehabilitation therapists, and stroke specialists working together. Prompt recognition and treatment of ischemic stroke is critical. Emergency medicine providers must be adept at identifying early stroke symptoms to initiate immediate care. Neuroimaging technicians and radiologists are essential for quickly obtaining and interpreting scans such as CTs and MRIs, which are vital for confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Neurointeventionalists may be needed to provide interventions such as thrombectomies. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the timely administration of thrombolytic agents when appropriate and in managing the patient's medication regimen to prevent complications and secondary strokes. Nurses monitor patients closely for changes in condition and manage care protocols. Rehabilitation therapists are vital to the patient's recovery process, starting in the acute phase and continuing through long-term rehabilitation. The prognosis for patients treated with TPA is good, but the outcomes are guarded for those who do not receive thrombolytic medication. Effective communication among all team members is paramount for the rapid diagnosis, decision-making, and implementation of treatment plans. This collaboration facilitates a comprehensive approach to care, from acute management to rehabilitation and secondary prevention. All care decisions should be based on ethical considerations, including informed consent and respect for patient autonomy. The team prioritizes shared decision-making, respecting patient preferences while ensuring beneficence and non-maleficence."

    "text": "Etiology\nCardioembolic strokes can occur as a consequence of any cardiac insult that could cause the fulfillment of Virchow triad of endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability. Commonly encountered causes include:\n- Atrial disease:\n- Arrhythmias:\n- Atrial fibrillation, specifically non-valvular atrial fibrillation, is believed to be the most prevalent cause of cardioembolic strokes. Considered the most frequently encountered sustained arrhythmia, it occurs in approximately 5% of people aged 65 years and above. In western populations, most cases are believed to occur secondary to ischemic or hypertensive heart disease. Other contributing factors include hyperthyroidism and heavy alcohol consumption. The contribution of valvular heart disease, particularly the involvement of the mitral valve, is on the decline in terms of the number of cases. However, concerning relative risk, patients with valvular atrial fibrillation have a 17-fold increased risk of cardioembolic stroke, as opposed to the 2-7 fold increased risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The CHADS2 risk stratification tool is often used to predict the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation\n- Sick sinus syndrome, also known as a bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, is also associated with an increased risk of stroke. - Structural disease:\n- Patent foramen ovale: The role of a patent foramen ovale in strokes, particularly the so-called \"cryptogenic strokes,\" is currently an area of great interest. Current evidence is insufficient to conclude about its role as a causative factor, or merely as a conduit for paradoxical emboli. - Valvular heart disease: Even with the absence of arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases correlate with an increased risk of stroke. These include:\n- Rheumatic valvular disease; the most common is rheumatic mitral stenosis. Without anticoagulation, the risk of stroke is very high. - Infective endocarditis: Approximately 10% of cases of infective endocarditis develop embolic strokes. The risk of stroke occurrence is highest before instituting, or within the first two weeks of antibiotic therapy."

Anticoagulation is contraindicated because, usually, they are associated with superimposed microhemorrhages. However, current recommendations are to start anticoagulation seven days after a stroke. - Non-infective endocarditis such as marantic endocarditis\n- Valvular calcifications: Native valvular calcification, particularly of the mitral valve, increases the risk of developing a cardioembolic stroke. Mitral annular calcification correlates with a relative risk of 2.1 for the development of embolic stroke. - Mechanical prosthetic heart valves have a stroke rate of 2% to 4%, even in patients maintained on oral anticoagulation. Permanent anticoagulation with an INR between 2.5-3.5 is mandatory. Bioprosthetic heart valves have a lower risk of stroke, and aspirin is recommended unless the patient has atrial fibrillation. - Mitral valve prolapse has a low risk of stroke, and anticoagulation is not recommended. However, long-term aspirin is recommended. - Structural and functional ventricular diseases:\n- Ventricular aneurysms\n- Septal aneurysms\n- General ventricular hypokinesia (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction): The annual rate of stroke in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is approximately 2%, with a direct correlation between the risk of a stroke, and the degree of ventricular compromise. - Myocardial infarction: The occurrence of myocardial infarction increases the risk of the development of a stroke, with the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, the presence of a ventricular aneurysm or mural thrombus, and the presence of arrhythmias significantly influencing the degree of risk.

Pathophysiology\nAs with any thrombus, the fundamental pathophysiology is vested within Virchow's triad. Stasis of blood, as occurs with ventricular akinesia or aneurysms, predisposes to thrombus formation. Similarly, the lack of atrial contractility in atrial fibrillation results in an increased predisposition to clot formation, particularly in the left atrial appendage. These thrombi can either remain indolent and later undergo organization or embolize to systemic circulation - stroke is a potential consequence. With atrial fibrillation, this risk is greatest when converting a patient back to sinus rhythm.\nThe endothelial injury that accompanies valvular lesions also predisposes to hypercoagulability and thrombus formation, with similar potential consequences.\nThe cardiac emboli may consist of cholesterol, thrombus, platelet thrombi, calcium, or even bacterial clumps. Emboli from the heart can be distributed anywhere in the body, but more than 80% migrate to the brain. Of the emboli to the brain, the majority involve the anterior circulation, with only about 20% involving the vertebrobasilar circulation.\nWhen emboli enter the brain, they not only obstruct blood flow but may become detached and migrate further distally. Thus, reperfusion is another form of injury."

When emboli enter the brain, they not only obstruct blood flow but may become detached and migrate further distally. Thus, reperfusion is another form of injury. Evaluation\n**Cardiac Evaluation**\nThe preliminary cardiac evaluation must be directed towards evaluating both the electrophysiologic status of the heart as well as structural and functional status. As such, workup must include a 12-lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiography for all patients. **Electrophysiologic Assessment**\n- A 12-lead ECG is useful only to the extent of detecting ongoing arrhythmias. Additionally, it may provide useful insight into ventricular myocardial status (evidence of ventricular hypertrophy) as well as indicate prior cardiac ischemic episodes. However, transient arrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, will be missed. - Holter monitoring has now become a part of the baseline evaluation of all cases of suspected cardioembolic strokes. Fundamentally similar to an ECG, it has the same drawback of evaluating the conduction system for a relatively limited period of 24 hours. - Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can record activity for as long as three years. Thus, their utility in clinical practice continues to increase, and their use has helped identify several cases of \"missed\" atrial fibrillation. Also, it is very important to note that a patient on oral anticoagulation with atrial fibrillation has to fall 295 times per year for the risk of traumatic subdural hematoma. **Structural and Functional Assessment**\n- Transthoracic echocardiography: Transthoracic echocardiography forms the cornerstone of cardiac evaluation. Ventricular hypo- or akinesia, aneurysms, as well as most valvular lesions, can be identified. However, aA key limitation is that visualization of the left atrial appendage is rarely possible using this imaging modality. - Transesophageal echocardiography: The transesophageal approach permits the use of higher-frequency probes that provide a significantly higher image resolution, and permit visualization of very minute pathologies, including intra-valvar abscesses."

A steeper learning curve and lack of universal availability limit its utility as a primary modality of cardiac imaging. An echocardiogram may detect the following pathologies:\n- Atrial septal defect\n- Patent foramen ovale\n- Atrial septal aneurysm\n- Atrial thrombus\n- Atrial myxoma\n- Aortic arch thrombi\n- Mitral valve vegetations\n**Neurologic Evaluation**\nAlthough the imaging modality of choice will differ based on the time of presentation of the patient (i.e., within the window period or outside it), the following principles govern the process of evaluation:\n- Parenchymal assessment:\n- MRI scans are, by far, the best available imaging modality to evaluate neural parenchymal status. The increasingly available 3 Tesla devices provide an unrivaled image resolution. Various imaging sequences help not only delineate the infarcted area but also help provide a temporal frame where history is sketchy. For instance, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help identify even hyper-acute infarcts by selecting the appropriate b-value. The presence of cortical stroke in multiple vascular territories should give suspicion for a cardioembolic etiology. The appearance of an infarct in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence indicates that the infarct has developed, at least partially, over 6 hours back. MRI scans can even accurately detect hemorrhagic infarcts by means of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Key limitations, however, are the relatively long duration required for the scan - a formidable contraindication in hemodynamically unstable patients - and ensuring compliance in claustrophobic patients. The increasing availability of \"open MRIs\" and \"virtual-reality based systems\" help alleviate the latter, but the former remains a major problem. - CT scans: CT scans are excellent imaging modalities for detecting or ruling out hemorrhage. Rapid imaging and ease of reporting, even in settings with limited expertise, remain its key redeeming features.

That said, it shows limited sensitivity in detecting infarcts early on in their evolution. Treatment / Management\nThe cornerstone of the management of cardioembolic strokes involves the use of anticoagulants for secondary prevention. However, the exact timing of the initiation of anticoagulation remains a matter of controversy. The intention is to strike a delicate balance between the risk of recurrence on the one hand and the risk of a hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct on the other. Current guidelines propose an arbitrary deferral of anticoagulation for two weeks after the event, based on the extrapolation of trials based on heparin use. Conventionally, vitamin K antagonists like warfarin are used for oral anticoagulation. Therapeutic response is monitored by serial assessment of prothrombin time and the international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The target INR is between 2.0 to -3.0. However, this target is scaled up to 2.5 to 3.5 for cases with metallic mitral valves. Although universally available and inexpensive, a poorly predictable dose-response curve, a penchant for drug interactions, and a heavy dependence on patient dietary compliance are key drawbacks of these agents. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent the new generation of oral anticoagulants that overcome the shortcomings of vitamin K antagonists. Available agents include apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban. These newer agents are believed to have a more predictable dose-response curve, and their use obviates the need for repeated monitoring. A key drawback of these DOACs was the lack of availability of a reversal agent; however, this is no longer always the case. Reversal agents for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and rivaroxaban and apixaban (recombinant factor Xa - andexanet alfa) have received FDA approval and are available for clinical use."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nCardioembolic stroke is a devastating disease with a high risk of recurrence and complications if it is not identified and treated properly. The treatment involves multiple levels of evaluation, drugs, and therapy to optimize patient recovery. An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists is needed to treat these patients effectively.\nMost hospitals have an interprofessional team dedicated to the management of patients with stroke. This stroke team consisting of a cardiologist, a neurologist, a dedicated radiologist (potentially an interventional neuro-radiologist if thrombectomy is warranted), and an internal medicine physician, is vital in improving outcomes. The clinicians need to maintain a high degree of suspicion for underlying arrhythmias or cardiac diseases that can lead to an embolic etiology of the stroke. Due diligence with thorough evaluation is warranted to rule out this disease.\nIn addition, a stroke nurse is needed to monitor the patient's neurologic status during the hospital stay and to assist the medical team in educating the patient to prevent a recurrence. The clinical pharmacist is needed to assist the team in educating the patient on drug compliance and to adjust medications to minimize adverse outcomes. An integrative and collaborative interprofessional team can greatly improve outcomes for patients with this disease. [Level V]\nCurrent evidence regarding when to initiate treatment is still sketchy. Trials such as the TIMING study are likely to add valuable information to the existing knowledge base."

The microaneurysms are named as Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms. - The common sites of hypertension-induced intracerebral hemorrhage are the small penetrating arteries originating from basilar arteries or the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries. - Small artery branches of 50 to 700 \u03bcm in diameter often have multiple sites of rupture associated with layers of platelet and fibrin aggregates. - Hypertensive change causes non-lobar intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). As seen in eclampsia, acute hypertension can also cause ICH, known as postpartum ICH. **Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)** is an important cause of primary lobar intracerebral bleeding in older adults. - It is characterized by the deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide in the capillaries, arterioles, and small- and medium-sized arteries in the cerebral cortex, leptomeninges, and cerebellum. - This causes ICH in older adults, commonly associated with variations in the gene encoding apolipoprotein E.\n- A familial syndrome can occur in young patients, typically associated with mutations in the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein. - The incidence of CAA increases with age to the extent that around 50% of those aged more than 70years have CAA. Recurrent hemorrhages can occur due to CAA. **Other Important Risk Factors**\n- Cigarette smoking and moderate or heavy alcohol consumption, and chronic alcoholism are significant risk factors. - Chronic liver disease also increases the chance of ICH due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. - Decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low triglycerides are also risk factors. - Dual antiplatelet therapy has an increased risk of ICH than monotherapy. - Sympathomimetics such as cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine carry an increased risk of a cerebral hemorrhage."

Pathophysiology\nThe common sites of the bleed are the basal ganglia (50%), cerebral lobes (10% to 20%), the thalamus (15%), pons and the brain stem (10% to 20%), and the cerebellum(10%)(fig.1,2,3). The hematoma disrupts the neurons and glia. This results in oligaemia, neuro-transmitter release, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular swelling. Thrombin activates microglia and causes inflammation and edema.\nThe primary injury is due to the compression of brain tissue by the hematoma and an increase in the intracranial pressure(ICP).\nSecondary injury is contributed to by inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), edema, overproduction of free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and release of hemoglobin and iron from the clot.\nUsually, the hematoma enlarges in 3 hours to 12 hours. The enlargement of hematoma occurs in 3 hours in one-third of cases. The perihematomal edema increases within 24 hours, peaks around 5 to 6 days, and lasts up to 14 days. There is an area of hypoperfusion around the hematoma. The factors causing deterioration in ICH are an expansion of hematoma, intraventricular hemorrhage, perihematomal edema, and inflammation. Cerebellar hematoma produces hydrocephalus by compression of the fourth ventricle in the early stage.\nNon-aneurysmal spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage may be either perimesencephalic or non-perimesencephalic SAH. In perimesencephalic SAH, bleeding is mainly in the interpeduncular cistern. Physical exertion, such as the Valsalva maneuver producing increased intrathoracic pressure, and elevated intracranial venous pressure, is a predisposing factor for perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH (PM-SAH). There is diffuse blood distribution in non-perimesencephalic SAH (NPM-SAH)."

These sequences are more sensitive than CT for identification of prior hemorrhage. In the subacute phase, the hematoma may be isodense to brain tissue, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary. The volume of the hematoma can be measured by the formula AxBxC/2, where A and B are the largest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to that. C is the vertical height of the hematoma. Intracerebral hemorrhage with a volume of more than 60 ml is associated with high mortality. The other poor prognostic factors are hematoma expansion, intraventricular hemorrhage, infra-tentorial location, and contrast extravasation on CT scan (spot sign). The paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin allow early detection of hemorrhage in MRI. Gradient echo (GRE) imaging is as good as CT in detecting acute bleed. MRI can distinguish between the hemorrhagic transformation of infarct and primary hemorrhage. MRI can detect underlying causes of secondary hemorrhages, such as vascular malformations, including cavernomas, tumors, and cerebral vein thrombosis. Extravasation of contrast in CT angiogram (CTA) indicates ongoing bleeding associated with fatality."

Vascular abnormalities need to be suspected if the following findings are present on a plain CT scan:\n- Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n- Enlarged vessels or calcifications along the margins of the ICH\n- Hyperattenuation within a dural venous sinus\n- A cortical vein along the presumed venous drainage path\n- Unusual hematoma shape\n- Presence of edema out of proportion to the time of presumed ICH\n- An unusual hemorrhage location\n- Presence of other abnormal structures in the brain (like a mass)\nAn additional MRI scan will be beneficial in the following circumstances to identify a secondary cause for ICH:\n- Lobar hemorrhage location\n- Age \\<55 years, and\n- No history of hypertension\nMagnetic resonance venography or CT venography is indicated based on the following conditions that suggest cerebral venous thrombosis:\n- Hemorrhage location\n- Relative edema volume\n- Abnormal signal in the cerebral sinuses\nBlood investigations such as bleeding time, clotting time, platelet count, peripheral smear, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time(aPTT) will detect any abnormality of bleeding or coagulation and any hematological disorder which can cause hemorrhage. Liver function tests and renal function tests are also needed to exclude any hepatic or renal dysfunction as a cause. The investigations to rule out vasculitis are the quantitative evaluation of immunoglobulins, thyroid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA antibodies), Histon antibodies, complement, anti-Ro [SS-A] and anti-La [SS-B-] antibodies, cytoplasmic staining and perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c- and pANCA), and anti-endothelial antibodies."

Treatment / Management\nThere are many different opinions on the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. There are many trials on the optimal management of hemorrhagic stroke - Antihypertensive Treatment in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage(ATACH), Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT), Factor VIIa for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment (FAST), and Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH). The role of surgery in hemorrhagic stroke is a controversial topic. **Blood pressure (BP) Management**\nBP should be reduced gradually to 150/90 mmHg using beta-blockers (labetalol, esmolol), ACE inhibitor (enalapril), calcium channel blocker (nicardipine), or hydralazine. BP should be checked every 10-15 minutes. ATACH study observed a nonsignificant relationship between the magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction and hematoma expansion and 3-month outcome. But the INTERACT study showed that early intensive BP-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours. It has been found that high SBP is associated with neurological deterioration and death. The American Stroke Association (ASA) recommendation is that for patients presenting with SBP between 150 and 220 mmHg, the acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe and can improve functional outcomes. For patients presenting with SBP >220 mmHg, an aggressive reduction of BP with a continuous intravenous infusion is needed. **Management of Raised Intracranial Pressure (ICP)**\nThe initial treatment for raised ICP is elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees and using osmotic agents (mannitol, hypertonic saline). Mannitol 20% is given at a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg. Hyperventilation after intubation and sedation to a pCO of 28 to 32 mmHg will be necessary if ICP increases further."

    "text": "Mannitol 20% is given at a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg. Hyperventilation after intubation and sedation to a pCO of 28 to 32 mmHg will be necessary if ICP increases further. ASA recommends monitoring ICP with a parenchymal or ventricular catheter for all patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) \\<8 or those with evidence of transtentorial herniation or hydrocephalus. The ventricular catheter has the advantage of drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the case of hydrocephalus. The aim is to keep cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) between 50 to 70mmHg. **Hemostatic Therapy**\nHemostatic therapy is given to reduce the progression of hematoma. This is especially important to reverse the coagulopathy in patients taking anticoagulants. Vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), etc., are used. ASA recommends that patients with thrombocytopenia should receive platelet concentrate. Patients with elevated prothrombin time INR should receive intravenous vitamin K and FFP or PCCs. FFP has the risk of allergic transfusion reactions. PCCs are plasma-derived factor concentrates containing factors II, VII, IX, and X. PCCs can be reconstituted and administered rapidly. The FAST trial showed that rFVIIa reduced the growth of the hematoma but did not improve survival or functional outcome. rFVIIa is not recommended in unselected patients since it does not replace all clotting factors. **Antiepileptic Therapy**\nAround 3 to 17% of patients will have a seizure in the first two weeks, and 30% of patients will show electrical seizure activity on EEG monitoring. Those with clinical seizures or electrographic seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs. Lobar hematoma and the enlargement of hematoma produce seizures associated with neurological worsening. Subclinical seizures and non-convulsive status epileptics also can occur. **C** ontinuous EEG monitoring is indicated in patients with a decreased level of consciousness. Otherwise, prophylactic anticonvulsant medication is not recommended, according to ASA guidelines. **Surgery**\nThe different types of surgical treatment for hemorrhagic stroke are craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, stereotactic aspiration, endoscopic aspiration, and catheter aspiration. The STICH trial showed no overall benefit from early surgery for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage compared with initial conservative treatment."

The STICH trial showed no overall benefit from early surgery for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage compared with initial conservative treatment. Those who have lobar hemorrhages within 1 cm of the surface of the brain and milder clinical deficits (GCS>9) may benefit from early surgery. Emergency surgical evacuation is indicated in cerebellar hemorrhage with hydrocephalus or brainstem compression. Patients with cerebellar hemorrhages of >3 cm in diameter will have better outcomes with surgery. Cerebellar hematoma is evacuated by suboccipital craniectomy. Evacuation of brainstem hemorrhages can be harmful and is not recommended. A minimally invasive procedure such as stereotactic aspiration is also on trial. Hattori et al. showed in a randomized study that stereotactic evacuation is of value in patients with spontaneous putaminal hemorrhage, whose eyes will open in response to strong stimuli. Minimally invasive surgery plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rt-PA) for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE) was a randomized, prospective trial that tested image-guided catheter-based removal of the blood clot. It showed a reduction in perihematomal edema with clot evacuation. The Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of IntraVentricularr Hemorrhage (CLEAR IVH) trial showed that low-dose rt-PA can be safely administered to stable intraventricular clots and can increase lysis rates. Decompressive craniectomy and hematoma evacuation are now being done more frequently for hemorrhagic stroke. Moussa and Khedr showed the improvement in outcome gained by adding decompressive craniectomy with expansive duraplasty to the evacuation of large hypertensive hemispheric ICH in a randomized controlled trial. Decompressive hemicraniectomy with hematoma evacuation is performed in patients with GCS scores of 8 or less and large hematomas with a volume greater than 60 ml (fig.5). It reduces mortality and may improve functional outcomes. **Cerebroprotection**\nThe secondary injury of hemorrhagic stroke comprises inflammation, oxidative stress, and toxicity of erythrocyte lysates and thrombin. So, strategies to reduce these are being tried. Pioglitazone, misoprostol, and celecoxib are tried to reduce inflammatory damage. Edaravone, flavanoid, and nicotinamide mononucleotide can reduce oxidative stress. The iron chelator deferoxamine is also in the experimental phase."

Prognosis\nThe poor prognostic factors are coma, large hematoma with volume greater than 30 ml, intraventricular hemorrhage, posterior fossa hemorrhage, old age greater than 80 years, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease. Early deterioration and death are the major problems with ICH. Coma, at the time of the presentation, indicates a grave prognosis. ASA recommends that the monitoring and management of patients with ICH should be in a dedicated stroke unit. At six months, only 20 percent of patients become independent. The survivors may enter into a persistent vegetative state or locked-in syndrome in case of extensive hemispherical damage or brainstem involvement, respectively.\nICH score introduced by Hemphill et al. predicts mortality. The points are given as 2 points for Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) 3-4, 1 point for GCS 5-12, 0 points for GCS 13-15, 1 point for>80 years, 0 points for \\<80 years, 1 point for infratentorial location, 0 points for supratentorial location, 1 point for ICH volume >30 ml, 0 points for volume \\<30 ml. 1 point for intraventricular hemorrhage and 0 points for the absence of intraventricular hemorrhage. The 30-day mortality of each score is as: 0% for score 0, 13% for score 1, 26% for score 2, 72% for score 3, 97% for score 4, and 100% for scores 5 and 6."
