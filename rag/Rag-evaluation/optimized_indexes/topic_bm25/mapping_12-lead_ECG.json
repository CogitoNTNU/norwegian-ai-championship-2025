Introduction\nIschemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Although there have been significant improvements in the overall management of patients suffering from acute coronary syndromes (ACS), this entity is still associated with a relevant clinical burden. In this context, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is central to the diagnostic process and treatment allocation, as early diagnosis allows for a timely reperfusion strategy. Though differentiation between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is pivotal, over the years, several electrocardiographic patterns associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events have been described.\nThe de Winter electrocardiogram pattern is a finding that, in a proper setting, is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. This electrocardiogram finding consists of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall, peaked positive T waves.

History and Physical\nGiven that the de Winter ECG pattern is generally associated with an ACS, patients frequently will present with a medical history positive for heart disease risk factors, including a family or personal history of heart disease, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Clinical features are also consistent with ACS (eg, oppressive acute chest pain and shortness of breath).\nBecause the de Winter ECG pattern is often associated with a hyperacute stage of myocardial infarction (MI), physical examination can be unremarkable. However, some patients may present with diaphoresis and ongoing discomfort associated with acute symptomatology in the setting of ACS. Findings on physical examination may also vary, as detailed by the Killip classification system, which was developed to guide the clinical assessment of patients with myocardial infarction.\n- Killip class I: patients without any clinical sign of heart failure\n- Killip class II: patients with crackles or rales in the lungs, elevated jugular venous pressure, and an S3 gallop\n- Killip class III: patients with evident acute pulmonary edema\n- Killip class IV: patients with cardiogenic shock or hypotension (ie, a systolic blood pressure \\<90 mm Hg) and signs of low cardiac output (eg, oliguria, cyanosis, or impaired mental status)"

Additionally, most individuals present with a 1 to 2 mm ST-segment elevation in lead aVR. Other possible findings include loss of R wave progression in the precordial leads and QRS complexes of normal duration or only slightly widened. (see **Image.** The de Winter ECG pattern)\nHowever, strict criteria defining the de Winter ECG pattern remain elusive, as elegantly reported in a systematic review by Morris et al which showed differences in categorization among studies. In this review, upsloping depression of the ST-segment focusing on lead V3 and associated with upright T waves were consistently reported, whereas most individuals also had poor progression of the R wave as well as ST-segment elevation in lead aVR. Interestingly, although initially described as comprising a static pattern, which was also noted in other studies, there are reports describing a potential temporal evolution as the ischemic event unfolds.\nCardiac biomarkers, specifically high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), should be assessed, though as stressed in contemporary guidelines, this should not delay the reperfusion strategy. This pattern is associated with a hyperacute presentation, and therefore, clinicians should be aware that hs-cTn may be within the normal range or only mildly elevated initially. Given the differential diagnosis, serum potassium levels may be considered, though this should not delay the reperfusion strategy."

The word ECG derives from the German language. In German, it is elektro-kardiographie. In 1902, the Dutch physician Einthovan invented ECG, and his tremendous input in clinical studies for about ten years led to full recognition of the clinical potential of the technique.\nMany arrhythmias and ECG changes associated with angina and atherosclerosis were identified by 1910. William Einthoven was named the \"father of electrocardiography\" and was awarded Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1924 for his hard work that laid the foundation of the most fundamental technique for investigating heart disorders. ECG was soon recognized as a robust screening and clinical diagnostic tool, and today it is used globally in almost every healthcare setting.\nECG is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that has a substantial clinical impact on investigating the severity of cardiovascular diseases. ECG is increasingly being used for monitoring patients on antiarrhythmics and other drugs, as an integral part of preoperative assessment of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and for screening individuals in high-risk occupations and those participating in sports. Also, ECG serves as a research tool for surveillance and experimental trials of drugs with recognized cardiac effects.\nCardiovascular disease, as the number one cause of death, puts a great emphasis on healthcare providers developing skills and knowledge in interpreting ECGs to provide the best care promptly. Many healthcare providers find the advanced interpretation of ECG findings a complicated task. Errors in the analysis can lead to misdiagnosis, delaying the appropriate treatment. This activity seeks to provide a general understanding of the ECG mechanisms, interpretation techniques, and commonly encountered ECG findings."

This activity seeks to provide a general understanding of the ECG mechanisms, interpretation techniques, and commonly encountered ECG findings. Anatomy and Physiology\nA basic understanding of cardiac anatomy and coronary distribution is essential to understanding electrocardiographic findings. The heart is a vital body organ and occupies space in the central chest between the lungs. Together with the blood vessels and blood, it constitutes the body's circulatory system. The heart is a muscular organ comprised of four chambers with two atria (right and left) opening into right and left ventricles via tricuspid and mitral valves, respectively. A wall of muscle called the septum separates all four chambers. The heart receives deoxygenated blood from the whole body via superior and inferior vena cava, which first enters the right atrium. From here, it transits through the right ventricle and then passes into the lungs via the right and left pulmonary arteries, where it is oxygenated. The oxygenated blood from the lungs pours into the left atrium through the right and left pulmonary veins, and from here, it is pumped by the left ventricle into the aorta to the rest of the body. The heart derives its blood supply from the coronary arteries that branch off the aorta. The right and left coronary arteries lie on the surface of the heart. With considerable heterogeneity among the general population, different regions of the heart receive vascular supply from the various branches of the coronary arteries. This anatomic distribution is significant because a 12-lead ECG assesses these cardiac regions to help localize and diagnose ischemic or infarcted areas. Written below are the following regions supplied by the different coronary arteries."

It is essential to possess a strong understanding of the physiology of the cardiac cells as this will help the reader appreciate how the heart works and the implications of findings on the ECG. The heart is made up of specialized cardiac muscle, which is striated and organized into sarcomeres. These muscle fibers contain a single central nucleus, numerous mitochondria, and myoglobin molecules. Extensive branching of the cardiac muscle fibers and their end-to-end connection with each other through intercalated discs make them contract in a wave-like fashion. This mechanical work of pumping blood to the whole body occurs in a synchronized manner and is under the control of the cardiac conduction system. It is comprised of two types of cells, pacemaker and non-pacemaker cells. Pacemaker cells are located primarily in the SA and AV node, and it is the SA node that drives the rate and rhythm of the heart. The AV node gets suppressed by the more rapid pace of the SA node. The specialized function associated with the pacemaker cells is their spontaneous depolarization with no true resting potential. When spontaneous depolarization reaches the threshold voltage, it triggers a rapid depolarization followed by repolarization. The non-pacemaker cells mainly comprise the atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle cells and Purkinje fibers of the conduction system. They consist of true resting membrane potential, and upon initiation of an action potential, rapid depolarization is triggered, followed by a plateau phase and subsequent repolarization. Action potentials are generated by ion conductance via the opening and closing of the ion channels."

    "text": "Equipment\nThe American College of Cardiology (ACC), in conjunction with American Heart Association (AHA) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), has formulated guidelines and set technical standards for ECG equipment. With advancements, most ECG machines have become digital and can autogenerate preliminary findings based on the morphology criteria. The conventional ECG machine consists of 12 leads divided into two groups, i.e., limb leads and precordial leads. Limb leads are further categorized as standard bipolar limb leads (I, II, and III) and augmented unipolar leads (aVL, aVF, and aVR). The precordial leads include V1 to V6. The limb leads view the heart in a vertical plane, and the precordial leads record the heart's electrical activity in the horizontal plane. The ECG represents a graphic recording of the electrical cardiac activity traced on the electrocardiograph paper. The fundamental principle behind recording an ECG is an electromagnetic force, current, or vector with both magnitude and direction. When a depolarization current travels towards the electrode, it gets recorded as a positive deflection, and when it moves away from the electrode, it appears as a negative deflection. - A current of repolarization traveling away from the positive electrode is seen as a positive deflection and towards a positive electrode as a negative deflection. - When the current is perpendicular to the electrode, it touches the baseline and produces a biphasic wave. These concepts are easily applied to the heart while recording the ECG. Several types of ECG monitoring equipment are available, including continuous ECG monitoring, hardwire cardiac monitoring, telemetry, ambulatory electrocardiography, transtelephonic monitoring, wireless mobile cardiac monitoring systems, etc. Furthermore, a duo of ECG and electronic stethoscopes have been designed into a portable, handheld device that can review ECG rhythms and intervals at the bedside for analysis."

Technique or Treatment\nElectrocardiogram machines are designed to record changes in electrical activity by drawing a trace on a moving electrocardiograph paper. The electrocardiograph moves at a speed of 25 mm/sec. Time is plotted on the x-axis and voltage on the y-axis. On the x-axis, 1 second is divided into five large squares, each representing 0.2 sec. Each large square is further divided into five small squares of 0.04 sec each. The ECG machine is calibrated in such a way that an increase of voltage by one mVolt should move the stylus by 1 cm.\nThe conventional 12-lead ECG consisting of six limbs and six precordial leads is organized into ten wires. The limb leads include I, II, III, aVL, aVR, and aVF and are named RA, LA, RL, and LL. The limb leads are color-coded to avoid misplacement (red - right arm, yellow - left arm, green - left leg, and black - right leg). The precordial leads V1 to V6 are attached to the surface of the chest. For the correct location, the \"angle of Louis\" method is an option, and the exact placement is as follows:\n- V1 is placed to the right of the sternal border, and V2 is situated to the left of the sternal edge.\n- V4 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. V4 should be placed before V3. V3 is placed between V2 and V4.\n- V5 is placed directly between V4 and V6.\n- V6 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line.\n- V4 through V6 should line up horizontally along with the fifth intercostal space."

Clinical Significance\nThe goal of the electrocardiogram interpretation is to determine whether the ECG waves and intervals are normal or pathological. Electrical signal interpretation gives a good approximation of heart pathology. A standard 12 lead ECG is shown in [Figure 1]. The best way to interpret an ECG is to read it systematically:\n**Rate**\nFor the calculation of rate, the number of either small or large squares between an R-R interval should be calculated. The rate can be calculated by either dividing 300 by the number of big squares or 1500 by the number of small squares between two R waves. For an irregular rhythm, count the number of beats in a 10-second strip and multiply it by 6. Normal HR is 60 to 99 beats per minute. If it is less than 60, it is called bradycardia, and if greater than 100/min, it is referred to as tachycardia. **Rhythm**\nThe leads I, II, aVF, and V1, require inspection for an accurate interpretation of rhythm. It involves looking for five points: the presence or absence of regular P waves, the duration of QRS complexes (narrow or wide), the correlation between P waves and QRS complexes, whether the rhythm is regular or irregular, and the morphology of P waves. A regular rhythm ECG has regular P waves preceding a QRS complex in a regular rhythm. Also, normal sinus rhythm demonstrates positive P waves in leads I, II, and aVF, suggesting a downward propagation of atrial activation from the SA node. These features also help identify if the arrhythmia originates in the atria or ventricles."

These features also help identify if the arrhythmia originates in the atria or ventricles. Many disorders are related to rhythm abnormalities. For example, no real P waves can be seen in atrial fibrillation due to the very fast atrial activity. Only a few impulses get delivered to ventricles making the rhythm irregularly irregular. The presence of 'irregularly irregular' narrow QRS complexes with no discrete P waves is the hallmark feature in the identification of atrial fibrillation. **Cardiac Axis**\nIt refers to the direction of the heart's depolarization wavefront in the frontal plane. The cardiac axis is related to the area of significant muscle bulk within the healthy conducting system. A typical cardiac axis is between -30 to +90 degrees. A quick way to estimate the axis is by looking at leads I and aVF. It can be defined as a normal axis when the QRS complex is positive in leads I and aVF. A left axis deviation (between 0 and -90 degrees) is defined by the presence of positive QRS in the lead I and negative in lead aVF, and a right axis deviation (+90 and 180 degrees) by the presence of negative QRS in the lead I and positive in the lead aVF. If both QRS complexes are negative in leads I and aVF, it is an extreme right-axis deviation or indeterminate axis (-90 to 180 degrees). Other methods used to determine the cardiac axis include three-lead analysis, isoelectric lead analysis, etc. There are several disorders in which the cardiac axis deviates. Examples include old inferior myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left bundle branch block where left axis deviation occurs while noting right axis deviation in conditions including right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, hyperkalemia, and wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, etc. The specific criteria on ECG for atrial and ventricular hypertrophy are devised from examining various leads and wave morphologies: for atrial abnormality (enlargement or hypertrophy), leads II and V1 are usually assessed."

Right atrial hypertrophy increases the amplitude in the first half of the P waves by 2.5 mm in inferior leads and a possible right axis deviation. It is often termed P pulmonale because of its frequent association with chronic obstructive lung disease. Left atrial hypertrophy shows an increase in the amplitude of the terminal component and duration of the P wave. It must descend at least 1 mm below the isoelectric line in lead V1 and be at least 0.04 seconds (40 ms) in width. As the left atrium is electrically dominant, it shows no axis deviation. The diagnosis of ventricular hypertrophy requires looking at several leads on the ECG. The right ventricular hypertrophy characteristically shows by right axis deviation along with the presence of a more significant R wave than the S wave in lead V1, whereas in lead V6, a more significant S wave than the R wave. Left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by voltage criteria either by calculating the voltage of the R wave in V5 or V6 plus the S wave in V1 or V2 exceeding 35 mm or by the voltage of the R wave exceeding 13 mm in lead aVL. Infrequently, there is also the presence of secondary repolarization abnormalities, including asymmetric T wave inversion and downsloping ST-segment depression, commonly also referred to as the strain pattern; the left axis deviation often accompanies this. **P-wave**\nIt represents atrial depolarization on the ECG. As atrial depolarization initiates by the SA node located in the right atrium, the right atrium gets depolarized first, followed by left atrial depolarization. So the first half of the P wave represents right atrial depolarization and the second half shows left atrial depolarization. Its duration is three small squares wide and 2.5 small squares high. It is always positive in the lead I and II and consistently negative in lead aVR in normal sinus rhythm."

It is commonly biphasic in lead V1. An abnormal P wave may indicate atrial enlargement. **PR Interval**\nIt represents the time from the beginning of atrial depolarization to the start of ventricular depolarization and includes the delay at the AV node. The average interval is 3 to 5 small squares (120 to 200 ms). Variations in the PR interval can lead to various disorders. Long PR interval may indicate first-degree AV block, and short interval may be present in conditions with accelerated AV conduction, such as the presence of bypass tract or Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome. **Heart Block**\nA conduction block can occur due to any obstruction in the normal pathway of electrical conduction. Their anatomical location can be categorized as sinus node, atrioventricular node, or bundle branch blocks. - Sinus node or sinoatrial exit block occurs due to failed propagation of the impulses beyond the SA node resulting in dropped P waves on the ECG. Common causes include sick sinus syndrome, increased vagal tone, inferior wall MI, vagal stimulation, myocarditis, drugs including digoxin, beta-blockers, etc. - Atrioventricular or AV block is a conduction block that can occur anywhere between the SA node and Purkinje fibers. There are three variants of AV blocks: first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree. Clinically significant points in diagnosing the AV blocks include careful measurement of the PR interval and examining the relationship of the P waves to QRS complexes. - First-degree heart block is defined as prolonging the PR interval by more than 200 milliseconds. A single P wave precedes every QRS complex. It may be a normal finding in some individuals. Still, it can be an early sign of degenerative disease of the conduction system or a transient manifestation of myocarditis or drug toxicity, hypokalemia, acute rheumatic fever, etc. It usually does not require any treatment."

In type I, the block across the AV node or bundle of His is variable and increases with each ensuing impulse, ultimately resulting in a drop of the impulse (usually every third or fourth impulse). On ECG, it shows a progressive prolongation of the PR interval, and then suddenly, a P wave is not followed by the QRS complex. This sequence regularly repeats itself. Most patients with Mobitz type I second-degree AV block are asymptomatic. Mobitz type I AV block may occur in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or myocarditis. It may also result in clinical deterioration if the resulting ventricular rate is inadequate to maintain cardiac output. Most patients with Mobitz type I second-degree AV block are asymptomatic and do not require specific intervention. Rarely patients with Mobitz type I block are symptomatic and demonstrate hemodynamic instability, and may require treatment with either atropine (emergently) or cardiac pacing. In type II AV block, there is a dropped beat without the progressive lengthening of the PR interval. It follows the all-or-nothing phenomenon. It usually occurs below the AV node at the level of the bundle of His. It clinically signifies a severe underlying heart disease that can progress to third-degree heart block. When diagnosed, it usually requires prompt treatment with a permanent pacemaker. - Third-degree heart block is characterized by a complete electrical dissociation between the atria and ventricles, resulting in the atria and the ventricles beating at their intrinsic rates. Degenerative disease of the conduction system is the leading cause of third-degree heart block. A complete heart block may present in acute myocardial infarction. Complete heart block may be reversible with prompt revascularization, especially in inferior MI. Lyme disease may be associated with a complete heart block and is potentially reversible with antibiotic therapy."

In the case of irreversible or permanent complete heart block, a permanent pacemaker remains the mainstay of the treatment. - Bundle branch block results from the conduction block of either left or right bundle branches. It gets diagnosed by examining the width and configuration of the QRS complexes. The right bundle branch block is represented on the ECG by the presence of a widened QRS complex greater than 0.12 seconds, along with an RSR pattern in V1 and V2. Also, there may be ST-segment depression and T wave inversions and reciprocal changes in leads V5, V6, I, and aVL. Conduction system disorders can cause the right bundle branch block, but it may be present as a standard variant in specific individuals. The left bundle branch block is represented on the ECG by a widened QRS complex greater than 0.12 seconds, broad or notched R wave with prolonged upstroke in the leads V5, V6, I, and aVL, along with ST-segment depression and T wave inversion, and reciprocal changes in leads V1 and V2. Usually, a left-axis deviation is also present. The left bundle branch usually signifies an underlying pathology, such as degenerative disease of the conduction system or ischemic heart disease. **QRS Complex**\nIt represents ventricular depolarization as current passes down the AV node. A standard QRS complex has a duration of less than three small squares (under 120 ms, usually 60 to 100 ms). A prolonged QRS may indicate hyperkalemia or bundle branch block. Conversely, a premature ventricular contraction or a ventricular rhythm can be associated with a wide QRS. **Septal Q-Wave**\nQ-wave often appears as a tiny negative deflection in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. It represents the depolarization of the interventricular septum. Its amplitude is not bigger than 0.1 mV, so septal depolarization is not always visible on the ECG. Pathological Q-waves on ECG can signify an old infarct."

Its amplitude is not bigger than 0.1 mV, so septal depolarization is not always visible on the ECG. Pathological Q-waves on ECG can signify an old infarct. A Q-wave duration greater than 40 milliseconds (one small box), depth greater than 1 mm, or a size greater than 25% of the QRS complex amplitude is pathologic. **R-Wave**\nIt is the tallest wave of the QRS complex, representing the electrical stimulus as it passes down the ventricles during depolarization. The R-wave progressively increases in amplitude, moving right to the left in the precordial leads, and is called R-wave progression. Lead V1 has the smallest R wave, and lead V5 has the largest. A reduced R-wave progression has several causes, including prior anteroseptal MI, left ventricular hypertrophy, inaccurate lead placement, etc. **S-Wave**\nIt represents the final depolarization of the Purkinje fibers. It is any downward deflection after R-wave. It may not be present in all ECG leads. S-wave is most significant in V1 and progressively becomes smaller to no S-wave in the lead V6. **T-Wave**\nIt represents ventricular repolarization. Its morphology is highly susceptible to cardiac and noncardiac influences like (hormonal and neurological). It is usually positive in leads with tall R-waves (upward deflection). The suggested criteria for the typical T wave include the size of one-eighth or less than two-thirds of the size of the R wave and a height of less than 10 mm. Abnormalities in the T-wave morphology include inverted, flat, biphasic, or tall tented T-waves. T waves can be helpful in a variety of pathologies; tall T waves in anterior chest lead III, aVR, and V1 with a negative QRS complex may suggest acute myocardial ischemia. Other causes of T wave abnormalities are caused by physiological factors (e.g., postprandial state), endocrine or electrolyte imbalance, myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, postcardiac surgery state, pulmonary embolism, fever, infection, anemia, acid-base disorders, drugs, endogenous catecholamines, metabolic changes, acute abdominal process, intracranial pathology, etc. **ST-Segment**\nIt depicts the end of ventricular depolarization and the beginning of ventricular repolarization."

    "text": "**ST-Segment**\nIt depicts the end of ventricular depolarization and the beginning of ventricular repolarization. The average duration of the ST segment is less than 2 to 3 small squares (80-120 ms). ST-segment is an isoelectric line and lies at the same level as PR-interval. Elevation or depression of the ST segment by 1 mm or more, measured at J point, is abnormal. A J point is a region between the QRS complex and the ST segment. ST-elevation is highly specific if present in two or more contiguous leads in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. If the vertical distance on the ECG trace and the baseline after the J-point is at least 1 mm in a limb lead or 2 mm in a precordial lead, it is clinically significant for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Correct ST segment interpretation is crucial as a type of ST-segment elevation is present in healthy individuals due to early repolarization, called J-point elevation. It is distinguished by the fact that the T wave does not merge with the ST segment and remains an independent wave. Several other disorders are also associated with ST-elevation, i.e., Prinzmetal angina, acute pericarditis, acute myocarditis, hyperkalemia, blunt trauma, pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, Brugada syndrome, ventricular aneurysm, and left bundle branch block. ST-elevations are diffuse in acute pericarditis and associated with PR-depression about TP-segments (except for leads V1 and aVR). In myocardial infarction, the ST elevation tends to be localized (inferior, anterior, posterior, lateral), often, but not always, with reciprocal ST depression. Secondly, the PR segment displacement is attributable to the subepicardial atrial injury. PR elevation can present in aVR, and PR depression is best seen in II, aVF, and V4-V6. PR-depression and slight downsloping appearance of TP segments are often known as Spodick sign of pericarditis and help distinguish acute pericarditis from acute MI. ST depression greater than 1 mm is often a sign of myocardial ischemia or angina. It can appear as a downsloping, upsloping, or horizontal segment on the ECG."

ST depression greater than 1 mm is often a sign of myocardial ischemia or angina. It can appear as a downsloping, upsloping, or horizontal segment on the ECG. A horizontal or downsloping ST depression greater than 0.5 mm at the J-point in two contiguous leads indicates myocardial ischemia. An upsloping ST depression in the precordial leads with prominent De Winter T waves is highly indicative of MI caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. ST depression can represent a reciprocal change with a morphology that resembles \"upside-down\" ST elevation and is typically seen in leads electrically opposite to the site of infarction. For example, posterior wall MI manifests as horizontal ST depression in leads V1-3 and is associated with tall R waves and upright T waves. Likewise, inferior wall STEMI produces reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL, and there is often a reciprocal ST depression in leads III and aVF in lateral wall MI. ST depressions are also associated with non-ischemic causes, including digoxin toxicity, hypokalemia, hypothermia, and tachycardia. **QT Interval**\nIt represents the start of depolarization to the end of the repolarization of ventricles. The normal QT interval duration is somewhat controversial, and various normal durations have been previously suggested. Generally, the normal QT interval is less than 400 to 440 milliseconds (ms), or 0.4 to 0.44 seconds. Women usually have a slightly longer QT interval than men. A QT interval has an inverse relation to the heart rate. A prolonged QT interval presents an imminent risk for serious ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. A common cause of QT prolongation includes medications, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, and congenital long QT syndrome. A short QT interval ( less than 360 milliseconds) may be associated with hypercalcemia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, or short QT syndrome. **U Wave**\nIt is a small wave that follows the T wave. It represents the delayed repolarization of the papillary muscles or Purkinje fibers. It is commonly associated with hypokalemia."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe use of an electrocardiogram has expanded from simple heart rate and essential rhythm monitoring to interpreting complex arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and other ECG abnormalities. The rapid detection of myocardial infarction has substantially reduced the door-to-balloon time for reperfusion therapy. Nurses' skills regarding assessment and comprehensive knowledge of the dysrhythmias can prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation and improve patient outcomes from the emergency department presentation through discharge and follow-up. Cardiology board-certified pharmacists can make appropriate medication recommendations for several medications, particularly antiarrhythmics, based on ECG readings and patient history, working in conjunction with the cardiologist.\nECG outcomes in management are noticeable in every department within the interprofessional healthcare team. Interaction among clinicians (MDs and DOs, including specialists, NPS, and PAs), nurses, patient care assistants, pharmacists, and ECG technicians is critical to providing the most effective patient care. Interprofessional collaboration and teamwork in the hospital setting prevent significant medical errors through multiple checkpoints and ensure timely emergency care in cardiac emergencies. For better outcomes, excellent professional ethics, patient satisfaction, and staff proficiency in evaluating ECGs are mandatory. There should be effective, open communication between interprofessional team members with appropriate role clarity, shared policies, and strategies to improve system-related issues to drive optimal patient outcomes."

    "text": "Introduction\nCardiovascular diseases substantially contribute to the burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Arrhythmias significantly contribute to cardiovascular morbidity; most cardiac arrests and sudden cardiac deaths are secondary to arrhythmias. The rapid, accurate diagnosis of dysrhythmias is essential to effectively treat patients, prevent complications, and optimize patient outcomes. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a foundational diagnostic tool offering valuable insight into the function of the cardiac conduction system. However, traditional ECG recordings in clinical settings provide only a snapshot of cardiac activity, limiting their ability to capture intermittent or subtle abnormalities.\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring enables continuous and prolonged surveillance of a patient's cardiac rhythm in their natural environment. Ambulatory ECG monitoring employs portable devices to record and analyze cardiac electrical activity over extended periods. Continuous, prolonged monitoring is more likely to detect transient or infrequent cardiac events that may go unnoticed during short-term recordings. The prototype of ambulatory ECG monitoring is the Holter monitor, invented in 1961. Ambulatory ECG monitoring has continually advanced; multiple devices are now available to improve diagnostic yield. Prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring is uniquely poised to capture elusive arrhythmias, evaluate the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapies, and assess overall cardiovascular health.\nThis activity reviews the various ambulatory ECG monitoring devices currently in clinical use and the indications, critical findings, and clinical significance of this testing modality."

This activity reviews the various ambulatory ECG monitoring devices currently in clinical use and the indications, critical findings, and clinical significance of this testing modality. Procedures\nVarious ambulatory ECG monitoring systems are in regular clinical use. These systems include but are not limited to the Holter monitor, different event recorders, patch monitors, mobile outpatient cardiac telemetry, and various implantable devices. Additionally, several consumer devices are available for monitoring the cardiac conduction system. **Continuous ECG Monitor**\nContinuous ECG monitors, or Holter monitors, are the most commonly utilized ambulatory ECG monitoring devices. Holter monitors permit the continuous recording of cardiac electrical activity for an extended period, typically 24 to 72 hours. These monitors are indispensable when evaluating patients with intermittent symptoms, effectively capturing episodes of arrhythmias that might otherwise remain undetected. Holter monitors are lightweight devices comprising electrodes attached to the patient's chest and connected to a compact recording device approximately the size of a deck of cards that may be worn on the waist or carried in a convenient pouch. (See **Image. ** Holter Monitor) Holter monitor recordings can be acquired in 2-, 3-, or 12-channel formats. The primary advantage of the Holter monitor is the capture of an extended duration of ECG data, enabling the detection and analysis of transient and infrequent arrhythmias easily missed during a snapshot ECG. Conventional Holter monitors require active patient participation; patients must manually record their symptoms in a journal or mark their occurrence by pressing a button on the recording device. The data obtained from a Holter monitor is downloaded, and a comprehensive report is generated. Reports include various parameters, including total heartbeats, average heart rate, maximum and minimum heart rates, number and type of premature beats, the duration and type of various tachyarrhythmias, and ST segment changes. (See **Image."

Reports include various parameters, including total heartbeats, average heart rate, maximum and minimum heart rates, number and type of premature beats, the duration and type of various tachyarrhythmias, and ST segment changes. (See **Image. ** Holter Monitor Data Output.) A Holter monitor may be the preferred modality of ambulatory ECG monitoring when evaluating patients with frequent daily symptoms. The utility of Holter monitors is limited by patient compliance and the brevity of the monitoring period. Patients must be willing to wear the monitor throughout the entire monitoring period; discomfort or skin irritation are common barriers to compliance. Due to the relatively brief duration of monitoring, a negative result does not exclude the existence of significant disease with infrequent events. Interpreting and analyzing such extensive ECG data requires expertise and is time-consuming. Holter monitors also do not provide real-time information and delay identifying essential events. **Event Recorders: Loop Recorders and Post-Event Monitors**\nEvent monitors are a suitable option for patients experiencing syncope, near syncope, or infrequent episodes of dizziness occurring weekly to monthly. Traditional post-event recorders are small devices capable of recording a single ECG lead for several minutes. The patient presses a button on the device while holding it to their chest to activate the recording capability. The recorded data can be quickly downloaded, permitting real-time monitoring if the patient promptly performs the download. Unlike a Holter monitor, a post-event recorder is unobtrusive and can be comfortably carried in a pocket when not in use; the need for chest wires is eliminated, and everyday activities are easily accomplished. The most significant drawback of post-event recorders is the lack of continuous ECG monitoring; placing the device against the chest makes it challenging to capture brief symptomatic episodes, and asymptomatic events go unrecorded. Additionally, the onset of the episode is not recorded; this impairs accurate diagnosis. External loop recorders address some of these limitations by continuously monitoring the cardiac conduction system, storing the data in a loop memory for 30 days, and actively recording event data when activated by the patient."

External loop recorders address some of these limitations by continuously monitoring the cardiac conduction system, storing the data in a loop memory for 30 days, and actively recording event data when activated by the patient. External loop recorders are indicated monitoring modalities for patients with infrequent nonsyncopal symptoms; syncopal patients cannot activate the monitor when unconscious. When activated, these recorders store data for a fixed period before and after the activation. While external loop recorders and event monitors are effective for frequent symptoms, the correlation between symptoms and ECG abnormalities is low for events that occur less than once monthly. In cases where extended monitoring is necessary, implantable loop recorders may be utilized. These devices are designed to be implanted subcutaneously in the chest wall via a minimally invasive procedure performed without general anesthesia. Implantable loop recorders can record data for up to 3 years, are MRI-compatible, and have low infection and complication rates. **Patch Monitor**\nPatch monitors combine user-friendly features with patient comfort. Patch monitors have an adhesive backing, adhere securely to the skin, and eliminate the need for irritating wires and electrodes. The lightweight and unobtrusive design of most patch monitors permits unrestricted daily activities. Patients can conveniently annotate symptoms using a button on the device, facilitating better correlation between symptoms and conduction events. Patch monitors are typically worn for 14 days, significantly extending the monitoring duration compared to the conventional 48-hour monitors. Prolonged monitoring increases the likelihood of identifying arrhythmias that might go unnoticed in shorter monitoring periods. A study conducted by Barret et al demonstrated that the adhesive patch monitor outperformed the Holter monitor in detecting cardiac events in patients with suspected arrhythmia. **Mobile Cardiac Outpatient TelemetryTM**\nIn contrast to the offline analysis permitted by typical patch monitors, Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry**TM** (MOCT**TM**) devices provide real-time, wireless arrhythmia monitoring, transmission, and analysis. Patients can trigger the machine to collect and automatically transmit data during symptomatic episodes. MOCT**TM** has demonstrated superior diagnosis of clinically significant arrhythmias compared to standard patient-triggered loop monitors."

The results demonstrated that an initial 30-day monitoring period with MCOT**TM** increased detection rates of atrial fibrillation at a cost 8 times lower than an ILR alone. **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators and Permanent Pacemakers**\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and permanent pacemakers (PPMs) can be continuous monitoring devices with detection algorithms for arrhythmias, including supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. (See **Image. ** Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Recording) When appropriately programmed, these devices exhibit sensitivity and specificity of greater than 95% in detecting atrial fibrillation. In specific scenarios, patients with ICDs or PPMs may undergo external ECG monitoring to assess the functionality of implanted devices and identify potential malfunctions. Device interrogation allows data retrieval regarding the frequency and duration of arrhythmias, ventricular rates, and the necessity for shock termination episodes. Additionally, remote monitoring of these devices is available to evaluate arrhythmias and the efficacy of delivered therapies. **Consumer Devices**\nRapidly advancing technology has led to the widespread availability of heart rate and rhythm monitors, employing smartphones as convenient storage devices for the captured data. Some of these monitors feature algorithms that can detect irregularities, particularly atrial fibrillation, offering the potential for early detection, treatment, and reduction of stroke risk. Some rhythm monitors in smartphones and handheld devices record single-lead ECG data, including rhythm strips, during symptomatic episodes; this data can be shared with physicians for review to streamline the process of atrial fibrillation detection. The iTransmit study introduced a compact handheld monitoring device that attaches to smartphone cases. This device exhibited 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity in detecting atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation compared to traditional trans-telephonic monitors. Lubitz et al conducted a study involving 455,699 participants who wore smartwatches with photoplethysmography sensors."

Indications\n**Syncope**\nSyncope is the loss of consciousness and postural control followed by spontaneous recovery without residual neurological effects. Syncope has many etiologies, including primary cardiac causes such as bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or inherited disorders such as Brugada or long-QT syndromes. Correlating symptoms with rhythm is the key to confirming cardiac electrical system involvement in syncope. A 12-lead ECG may establish this link; ECG monitoring over an extended period is an essential evaluation component in cases of intermittent syncope. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope suggest ambulatory ECG monitoring in symptomatic patients with near syncope, unexplained syncope, or episodic dizziness with an unknown cause. In a study of 85 patients with recurrent, undiagnosed syncope who underwent ILR placement to facilitate diagnosis, 42% of patients who recorded a rhythm during symptomatic syncopal episodes demonstrated an arrhythmia, usually some form of bradycardia. Data indicates that external loop recorders (ELRs) may be comparably effective to ILRs. Locati et al demonstrated that ELRs offered a diagnostic yield similar to ILRs within the same timeframe in patients with syncope and presyncope. Consideration of an ELR is a viable initial step for patients requiring extended ECG monitoring before resorting to implantable options. **Palpitations**\nThe 2017 ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope also suggest ambulatory ECG monitoring in symptomatic patients with recurrent palpitations of an unknown cause. Palpitations are one of the most prevalent reasons for ambulatory ECG monitoring."

Palpitations are one of the most prevalent reasons for ambulatory ECG monitoring. The underlying cause of palpitations can often be identified through an initial assessment and a 12-lead ECG; one-third of cases will have a psychiatric origin. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is recommended when the cause of the palpitations remains unknown, even after obtaining a comprehensive medical history, performing a physical examination, and evaluating a resting 12-lead ECG. Choosing an appropriate ECG monitoring device is predicated upon consideration of the clinical presentation and frequency of the palpitations. A traditional Holter monitor is indicated for patients experiencing daily symptoms. Loop recorders and patch monitors offer more diagnostic potential for those with infrequent palpitations, and opting for a 2-week monitoring period strikes a reasonable balance between diagnostic effectiveness and overall cost for most patients. **Chest Pain and Ischemic Episodes**\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring is valuable for patients with atypical chest pain associated with stresses other than exercise by enabling the assessment of myocardial ischemia during routine activities. Ambulatory ECG monitoring sometimes unveils an underlying arrhythmia as the initiator of chest pain. In a study by Stern et al of 50 patients with precordial pain, where positive results in ambulatory ECG monitoring were characterized by ST-segment deviations of \u22651 mm from the baseline pattern or significant T wave inversions demonstrated that of the 32 patients with positive abnormalities, 28 had severe coronary disease during coronary angiography. Conversely, among the 18 patients without positive monitoring results, only 3 met the angiographic criteria for severe coronary disease. Standard 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring helps recognize and evaluate early ischemic heart disease by recording dynamic changes, even when the resting 12-lead ECG appears normal. However, dynamic ST-segment changes may be confounded by body position or cardiac medications; cautious interpretation is warranted. Crawford et al."

However, dynamic ST-segment changes may be confounded by body position or cardiac medications; cautious interpretation is warranted. Crawford et al. In a study of 70 patients with chest pain, normal resting ECGs, and known significant coronary artery disease, Crawford et al determined a 62% sensitivity and 61% specificity rate for ST depression during ambulatory monitoring, concluding that continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring is limited in detecting or ruling out coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients with normal resting ECGs. Ambulatory ECG monitoring likely benefits patients with chest pain suggestive of variant angina secondary to transient coronary artery spasms. The baseline 12-lead ECG is typically expected in patients with variant angina, as transient coronary vasospasm usually occurs during periods of rest and without conventional triggers such as stress or exercise; capturing ECG changes during routine activities becomes imperative to the diagnosis. Clinicians can correlate patient symptoms with recorded ECG patterns, allowing for precise diagnosis, disease progression assessment, and therapeutic strategies. Significant ventricular tachyarrythmias can develop in about 50% of patients during vasospasm-induced ischemic attacks. Other ECG changes commonly seen during coronary vasospasm include ST-segment elevation, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and complete atrioventricular block."

Other ECG changes commonly seen during coronary vasospasm include ST-segment elevation, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and complete atrioventricular block. Normal and Critical Findings\n**Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\nNonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) is characterized by dilated left or bilateral ventricles and impaired systolic contractile function. NIDCM may result in life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The clinical utility of ambulatory ECG monitoring in NIDCM is debatable and may be of limited prognostic value. Some studies demonstrate that ambulatory ECG monitoring is a risk-stratification tool for SCD by detecting nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) episodes. Other studies suggest that ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias alone may not reliably predict SCD. Notably, 24-hour Holter monitoring has revealed NSVT in 40% to 60% of cases of SCD occurring during ambulatory monitoring. However, the role of ambulatory ECG monitoring extends beyond prognostication by identifying atrial fibrillation, thereby influencing therapeutic decisions, including initiating anticoagulation therapy to prevent strokes in patients with NIDCM. Moreover, recognizing paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias in young patients with NIDCM should warrant consideration of the possibility of underlying familial Lamin-A/C (LMNA) cardiomyopathy. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is linked to an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly among young individuals, including athletes. Patients with HCM frequently report syncopal episodes and palpitations. Asymptomatic NSVT with a ventricular rate exceeding \u2265120 beats per minute is observed in approximately 25% of adults with HCM cases and correlates with a notable escalation in SCD risk. Additionally, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias manifest during ambulatory ECG monitoring in up to 38% of patients with HCM. Given the pronounced vulnerability to SCD and arrhythmias, the 2020 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with HCM recommends 24- to 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring during the initial assessment and every 1 to 2 years after that for patients with HCM."

This proactive approach promotes early detection and risk stratification for patients with this genetic condition, enabling clinicians to devise targeted management strategies and improve the overall prognosis and quality of life. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\nVentricular and supraventricular arrhythmias are common among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study by Rusinowicz et al of 152 patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation revealed that 97% exhibited arrhythmias during 24-hour Holter monitoring. The most prevalent arrhythmia in the study was premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), occurring at an average of 1870 PVCs in 24 hours; supraventricular premature beats (SPBs) occurred at an average of 699 SPBs within the same timeframe. Additionally, supraventricular tachycardia was reported in 34% of the subjects. A retrospective investigation by Konecny et al of 6351 patients analyzed the incidence of ventricular tachycardia within a population of patients with COPD using Holter monitoring. Patients with COPD exhibited a higher prevalence of VT compared to their healthy counterparts; the occurrence of VT increased with the severity of COPD. Another study demonstrated arrhythmias in 72% of patients with COPD during ambulatory Holter monitoring. **Dialysis and End-Stage Renal Disease**\nPatients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including arrhythmia. Hemodialysis results in substantial hemodynamic and perfusion shifts; the dialysis procedure itself has been established as a contributor to the onset of atrial fibrillation. A cross-sectional study by Rantanen et al utilized 48-hour Holter monitors initiated just before each dialysis session in 152 patients and revealed PACs and PVCs in most patients; paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia affected 41% of studied patients. Another 8.6% of patients exhibited persistent atrial fibrillation, 3.9% experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 19.7% had NSVT, 4.6% had bradycardia, 1.3% had second-degree atrioventricular block, and 2.6% experienced third-degree atrioventricular block. PVCs were more prevalent on dialysis days, and tachyarrhythmias were more pronounced during dialysis and the immediate post-dialytic phase."

PVCs were more prevalent on dialysis days, and tachyarrhythmias were more pronounced during dialysis and the immediate post-dialytic phase. This data suggest that ambulatory ECG monitoring during dialysis could promote the early detection of arrhythmias in asymptomatic patients, which may prompt timely strategies for effective management. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**\nArrhythmias are a frequent manifestation in patients with mitral valve prolapse. In patients with prominent symptoms or detectable auscultatory findings, ambulatory ECG monitoring demonstrates a substantial prevalence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Symptoms commonly experienced by those with mitral valve prolapse include dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, and chest pain. Ambulatory ECG monitoring assesses these symptoms and establishes if arrhythmias contribute to their occurrence . One study revealed that only 27% of symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse exhibited arrhythmias linked to their symptoms. **Pre-Excitation Syndrome**\nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by an anomalous accessory electrical pathway within the heart and intermittent symptoms. Traditional resting 12-lead ECGs occasionally fail to detect WPW syndrome, prompting the consideration of ambulatory ECG monitoring. Among confirmed patients with WPW syndrome, ambulatory ECG monitoring has demonstrated that pre-excitation is intermittent in up to 67% of patients. **Sinus Node Dysfunction**\nHistorically known as \"sick sinus syndrome,\" sinus node dysfunction is frequently associated with age-related degenerative fibrosis affecting the sinus nodal tissue and surrounding atrial myocardium. During symptomatic episodes, sinus node dysfunction commonly manifests as prolonged sinus pauses lacking an accompanying escape rhythm. Ambulatory 24-hour ECG monitoring is often required to correlate symptoms with electrocardiographic evidence. Some patients with sinus node dysfunction remain asymptomatic during sinus pauses. Sinus node dysfunction may manifest with other ECG abnormalities, including periods of severe bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias. When a comprehensive history, physical examination, and initial 12-lead ECG fail to yield a diagnosis, ambulatory monitoring is a valuable tool for confirming the presence of sinus node dysfunction. A Holter monitor is recommended for individuals encountering daily symptoms, while those with less frequent symptoms are better evaluated with more prolonged monitoring."

A comprehensive investigation comprising 400 patients diagnosed with sleep apnea and monitored with a 24-hour Holter device found that 48% exhibited cardiac arrhythmias during sleep. Javaheri et al conducted a prospective study on 81 men with stable heart failure, 41 of whom had sleep apnea, and demonstrated that patients with sleep apnea have a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Holter monitoring may be a valuable tool for predicting the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. In a comparative analysis of 63 patients, Holter monitoring captured apnea events with 90% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity, compared to polysomnography, suggesting that Holter monitoring may enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in patients with certain sleep disorders. **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement**\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring has become essential for understanding arrhythmias before and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Studies using ambulatory ECG monitoring found bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias in approximately 15% of patients before TAVR, which led to treatment changes in approximately half of these cases. Identifying severe bradyarrhythmias before TAVR permits planned pacemaker implantation and decreases procedural complications. Detecting atrial fibrillation before TAVR can prompt early anticoagulation therapy and potentially reduce post-TAVR cerebrovascular events."

Detecting atrial fibrillation before TAVR can prompt early anticoagulation therapy and potentially reduce post-TAVR cerebrovascular events. Clinical Significance\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring plays a pivotal role in cardiology by providing continuous, prolonged ECG recording outside the clinical setting. Ambulatory ECG monitoring promotes the capture of elusive arrhythmias, gauges treatment efficacy, aids in risk stratification, and enhances syncope evaluation. As technology evolves, the potential for more advanced ambulatory monitoring devices promises further refinement of patient care strategies in cardiology. **Diagnosing Arrhythmias and Cardiac Abnormalities**\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring offers a dynamic insight into the heart's electrical activity throughout an extended period, enabling the detection of arrhythmias and cardiac abnormalities that might be missed during conventional ECGs. This technique captures intermittent or transient arrhythmic events, such as atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias, and premature ventricular contractions. By providing a comprehensive overview of a patient's heart rhythm, ambulatory monitoring aids in accurate diagnosis and informs appropriate treatment strategies. **Risk Stratification and Prognosis**\nRisk stratification is critical to managing cardiac patients, and ambulatory ECG monitoring contributes significantly to this process. Through continuous monitoring, clinicians can quantify the burden of arrhythmias, aiding in identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from interventions such as anticoagulation therapy or ICDs. **Syncope Evaluation**\nSyncopal episodes often pose diagnostic challenges due to their transient nature. Ambulatory ECG monitoring offers a valuable solution by recording cardiac activity during these episodes, potentially capturing arrhythmias or cardiac anomalies that could underlie the syncopal events. This data-driven approach enhances the accuracy of diagnosis and facilitates appropriate management strategies for patients experiencing unexplained syncope. **Long-Term Monitoring**\nCertain cardiac conditions necessitate extended monitoring to assess their impact on patient health. Ambulatory ECG monitoring conducted over an extended duration of days to months provides insight into the chronicity and variability of arrhythmic events."

    "text": "Function\nOne of the unique features of cardiac cells is automaticity. This is the ability to generate an electrical impulse without requiring a stimulus from an external source. Electrical impulses in the heart typically originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the \u201cpacemaker\u201d of the heart. The impulses travel down the internodal pathways via propagation through both the right and left atria (the left using the Bachman bundle) to the atrioventricular (AV) node or junction. The purpose of the AV node is 2-fold: (1) to allow for propagation of the electrical impulses from the atrium to the ventricle and (2) to delay these impulses to the ventricles to allow for the atria to empty. This is commonly referred to as an atrial kick and may account for up to 30% of cardiac output in young people and more as patients age. The P wave on the EKG represents atrial depolarization. The PR segment represents the delay at the AV node. The impulse then propagates down the bundle of His, which extends to the right and left bundles. Then, Purkinje fibers are activated, and a rapid, synchronized contraction of the ventricles occurs. This results in the QRS complex. After a small delay, the ventricles repolarize and prepare for the next impulse. This results in the T wave. The delay between depolarization and repolarization is called the ST segment."

After a small delay, the ventricles repolarize and prepare for the next impulse. This results in the T wave. The delay between depolarization and repolarization is called the ST segment. Issues of Concern\nSinus rhythms originate in the SA node. The SA node is located in the right atrium and is the heart's natural pacemaker. The normal rate of the SA node is between 60 and 100. On EKG, sinus rhythm is represented by monomorphic P waves before each QRS complex and is regular. These are typically upright in the inferior leads and downgoing in aVR. QRS complexes are generally narrow unless there is a conduction delay. Sinus tachycardia (rate greater than 100 beats per minute) can be the first hint of an underlying pathology such as hyperthyroidism or pulmonary embolism. Abnormal rhythms involving the atrium include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, wandering atrial pacemaker, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. In atrial fibrillation, the atria have no organized rhythm and no synchronized depolarization or repolarization. Instead, electricity is passed from 1 atrial myocyte to any surrounding repolarized myocyte, causing the atria to quiver rather than contract as a unit. The isoelectric line is lost; no discernible P waves are seen on EKG. QRS complexes are narrow unless there is an underlying right or left bundle branch block or if the ventricular rate is so fast that there is a rate-related bundle branch block (typically the right bundle). The ventricular rate is variable. This rhythm is classically described as irregularly irregular. Risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation include prolonged uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, advanced age, a history of congestive heart failure, and hyperthyroidism."

Risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation include prolonged uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, advanced age, a history of congestive heart failure, and hyperthyroidism. In atrial flutter, regular, rapid atrial contractions usually have a distinctive \"saw-tooth\" pattern on EKG. As with atrial fibrillation, the QRS complexes are narrow unless an underlying right or left bundle branch block exists. The ventricular rate is so fast that there is a rate-related bundle branch block (typically the right bundle). The atrial rate of atrial flutter is typically about 300 beats per minute, and the ventricular response can be variable but often presents initially as a 2:1 AV block, resulting in a ventricular response of about 150 BPM. Any time there is a regular rhythm with a narrow QRS complex at 130 to 170 BPM, atrial flutter should be considered. Atrial tachycardia is a rhythm that originates in a single micro reentry focus in the atria. This is seen on EKG with a P wave of different morphology than the sinus P wave. The rhythm is regular, and the QRS complex is narrow. The P axis can also differ, resulting in inverted P waves in inferior leads. Since this is from a single focus, the P waves are uniform throughout this rhythm, and it can be paroxysmal (comes and goes) or sustained. The rate is typically 130 to 170 BPM. Whereas atrial tachycardia is due to a single ectopic focus in the atrium, wandering atrial pacemaker and MAT are due to multiple microreentry foci in the atrium. If the ventricular rate is less than 100 bpm, it is considered a wandering atrial pacemaker; if the ventricular rate is greater than 100 bpm, it is considered MAT. In both of these rhythms, there are 3 or more atrial foci. On EKG, this is defined as 3 distinct P wave morphologies and 3 different PR intervals. The QRS is typically narrow unless there is an underlying ventricular conduction delay. Since the multiple foci are firing independently, these rhythms may appear irregularly."

The QRS is typically narrow unless there is an underlying ventricular conduction delay. Since the multiple foci are firing independently, these rhythms may appear irregularly. AVNRT occurs when 2 pathways within the AV node have varying conduction and repolarization rates. When the node is stimulated, typically by a premature atrial complex (PAC), when the slowly conducting pathway has repolarized, but the rapidly conducting pathway has not, AVNRT can ensue. When the slowly conducting pathway reaches the ventricle, the QRS is seen, and the nodal fast pathway then conducts back up to the atrium, creating reentry within the AV node itself. This cycle repeats itself and is seen on EKG as a regular, fast rhythm, usually about 150 BPM, with a narrow QRS complex. Retrograde P waves (P waves that occur after the QRS complex) are often seen only at the tail end of the QRS. This is often most easily seen in lead V1 as what is referred to as a pseudo R.\nAVRT utilizes a pathologic accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles to create a macro reentry circuit. This can be orthodromic (retrograde conduction is through the accessory pathway, and antegrade conduction is through the AV node) or antidromic (retrograde conduction is through the AV node, and antegrade conduction is through the accessory pathway). In AVRT, you typically see a normal, fast rhythm, usually around 150 bpm, with narrow QRS complexes. In AVRT, however, you often see preexcitation in the resting sinus rhythm EKG. Preexcitation, also called a delta wave, is due to a brief period of slow ventricular activation through the accessory pathway before the AV node releases the impulse to the bundle of His, thus leading to normal conduction and a narrow finish of the QRS. This also causes a shortened PR interval. PACs are commonly found on EKGs. They are due to an ectopic focus within the atrium firing earlier than the sinus node."

P wave morphology and PR interval for this premature atrial beat are usually different than the sinus P wave, though it may be similar if the focus is close to the SA node. While the RR interval between the last beat and the ectopic beat is shorter than normal, the interval between the last and next sinus beat is typically shorter than 2 normal R-R lengths because of an incomplete compensatory pause. After all, the PAC depolarizes the SA node. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occur when an ectopic focus in the ventricles fires. Since the impulse originates in a ventricle, it is slowly conducted through the ventricles, resulting in a wide QRS complex. Like other premature contractions, these occur during other rhythms. There is no P wave before the ectopic beat, and there is typically a compensatory pause such that the length of 2 normal R-R intervals is preserved. This is because the PVC does not depolarize the SA node, and the SA node continues to fire at its regular intervals. PVCs are typically benign and occur in healthy and unhealthy individuals. When PVCs occur every other beat, it is referred to as ventricular bigeminy; when they occur every third beat, it is referred to as ventricular trigeminy. Junctional escape rhythms occur either when there is sinus node disease with a very slow or nonexistent atrial rhythm (sick sinus syndrome) or when there is a complete heart block high in the AV node. The AV node has its automaticity (typically 40-50 bpm) and can become the heart's primary pacemaker. Not uncommonly, in junctional escape rhythms, particularly when they are present due to sinus node disease, there is a retrograde P wave seen just before or during the QRS, as the AV node depolarizes the ventricle and atrium simultaneously. Ventricular escape rhythms typically occur when there is a disease in the AV node (ie, complete heart block)."

    "text": "Etiology\n**Normal T-wave Etiology**\nNormally, the T wave is formed at the end of the last phase of ventricular repolarization. Ventricular repolarization is when the ventricular myocytes return to their negative resting potential to depolarize again. While this phase of the cardiac cycle is rapid, an upright low amplitude broad hump following the QRS complex is seen in normal T wave morphology. **Abnormal T-wave Etiology**\nAbnormalities in the T-wave may represent variations of normal cardiac electrophysiology or signs of pathology. Tall T-waves (hyper-acute T waves) can be an early sign of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The morphology of the T waves can begin to broaden and peak within 30 minutes of complete coronary artery occlusion. It thus may be the earliest sign of myocardial infarction on the EKG. The T waves are broadened and peaked in the leads corresponding to the artery occlusion. Tall T waves can also be signs of ventricular hypertrophy, depending on the distribution in the precordial leads. Additionally, T waves may be as tall as a normal variant. Due to this, it is crucial to compare all ECGs with elevations in T-wave morphology to a prior study. Elevated T waves may even occur as normal variation in young patients and athletes, typically in the precordial V2-V4 leads. Inverted T waves are associated with myocardial ischemia. The inversion of a T wave is not specific for ischemia, and the inversion itself does not correlate with a specific prognosis. However, this is correlative if the clinical history suggests ischemia in the setting of inverted T waves. Wellens syndrome is symmetrically inverted T waves in anterior precordial leads; these T waves suggest a severe narrowing of the left anterior descendent coronary artery at a proximal location (see**Image. ** Wellens Syndrome). Recognition of this condition is vital to prevent a large anterior STEMI."

Recognition of this condition is vital to prevent a large anterior STEMI. However, Wellens signs can be seen in other pathologies, such as pulmonary disease, so appropriate clinical correlation is imperative. Hyperkalemia is a condition that can cause peaked T waves. Depending on the degree of hyperkalemia, the peaked T-waves may range from a low amplitude to tall peaks to a sinusoidal pattern on ECG. The mechanism of the T-wave morphologies is through inhibition of the positively charged extracellular potassium on repolarization of the myocardium. In initial ECG changes in hyperkalemia, the T waves become narrow, pointed, and tall; these changes are seen in all leads on the EKG. As the hyperkalemia progresses, other EKG abnormalities may occur: decreased P wave height, a widened QRS, PR prolongation, and eventually, the ECG may become sinusoidal. Several medications are indirectly associated with T-wave abnormalities. Antiarrhythmics, digoxin, and diuretics can cause electrolyte abnormalities, leading to changes in T-wave appearance. A key to differentiating ischemia/infarction from electrolyte-induced T-wave changes is the distribution of changes on ECG. Electrolyte abnormalities cause diffuse changes in the T-wave morphology throughout the ECG rather than specific to a coronary artery distribution. Diffuse, deep, symmetrically inverted T waves may be seen in a severe central nervous system trauma or pathology. These are called cerebral T waves. Conditions associated with cerebral T waves are an ischemic stroke, intracranial bleeding, and traumatic brain injury. Left bundle branch block innately causes T wave to deflect in the opposite of the major deflection of the QRS. Diffuse T wave inversions on an ECG can be associated with pericarditis. The changes on an ECG for pericarditis occur over 2-3 weeks, initially with ST-elevation, then T wave inversion, with eventual resolution of the ST segment. Massive pulmonary embolism can cause right ventricular strain, manifesting as the classic S1Q3T3 (deep S wave in the lead I, Q wave, and T wave inversion in the lead III)."

Treatment / Management\nTreatment options differ depending on the etiology of the T-wave changes. Some T-wave changes require no intervention. However, some causes of T-wave changes are associated with high morbidity and mortality without emergent intervention. **Ischemia and Infarction**\nIf acute T waves are seen as indicative of ischemia in a coronary artery distribution, management should be focused on reperfusion and treatment of the acute coronary syndrome. **Hyperkalemia**\nIn severe hyperkalemia in the presence of peaked T-waves, calcium gluconate should be administered promptly to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmia. Mild hyperkalemia without T-wave abnormalities can be managed with polystyrene sulfonate, a potassium binder, insulin, which forces potassium intracellularly, or furosemide, which drives potassium out of the body through the urinary tract. **Pulmonary Embolism**\nPulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of T-wave changes. Treatment options for PE vary depending on the size and severity. Acute massive and submassive PEs should be considered for catheter-directed tPA. Smaller pulmonary embolisms in the absence of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain can be found for systemic anticoagulation. All institutions currently or planning on treating PEs in the future are encouraged to set up a pulmonary embolism response team made up of a cardiologist and pulmonologist. This team is designed to swiftly and accurately triage new PEs for appropriate treatment. **Pericarditis**\nPericarditis can be managed with ibuprofen and colchicine for at least three months. If recurrent pericarditis occurs, a longer course of treatment is recommended. **Drug-drug interaction or Intoxication**\nSerum drug levels may help identify intoxication with a particular medication that may be causing ECG abnormalities. It is recommended to stop the drug if intoxication or drug-drug interaction is suspected while workup is being done. Some drugs have reversal agents."
