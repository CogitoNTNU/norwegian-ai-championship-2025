    "text": "History and Physical\nIn gathering the history, it is important to identify any existing risk factors for pneumomediastinum as well as preceding events. Key elements of the history include:\n- History of smoking or recreational drug use\n- History of airway or lung disease\n- History of excessive vomiting or coughing\n- Recent history of instrumentation\n- History of blunt or penetrating trauma\nThe most common symptom of pneumomediastinum is retrosternal chest pain (60 to 100% of patients), which may radiate to the neck or back. Pain is typically acute in onset and may be preceded by excessive coughing or vomiting. Other symptoms include:\n- Dyspnea (75% of patients)\n- Coughing spells (80% of patients)\n- Neck pain (36% of patients)\n- Odynophagia\n- Dysphagia\n- Emesis\n- Abdominal pain\nThe most common sign on physical exam is subcutaneous emphysema (70% of patients). An uncommon but specific sign that may be present is the Hamman sign, a mediastinal crunch or click synchronous with the heart sounds auscultated over the cardiac apex. Other signs include:\n- Rhinolalia (nasal tone of speech)\n- Dysphonia\n- Hoarseness\n- Neck swelling\n- Tachycardia\n- Tachypnea\nRarely, patients may present with malignant pneumomediastinum, which is severe pneumomediastinum that obstructs the great vessels of the heart resulting in cardiac tamponade physiology."

Evaluation\nPneumomediastinum is usually diagnosed on chest X-ray. The most common finding is air outlining mediastinal structures (90% of cases). Lateral chest x-rays are rarely needed. Other signs on chest x-ray include:\n- Subcutaneous emphysema\n- Elevation of the thymus in pediatric patients (spinnaker sign)\n- Air surrounding the pulmonary arteries of the lung (ring sign)\n- A hyperlucent V shape between the descending aorta and the left hemidiaphragm\n- Double bronchial wall\n- Continuous diaphragm sign\n- Pleural effusion (which may indicate esophageal injury)\nIf chest x-ray findings are equivocal, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest can definitively rule in or rule out pneumomediastinum. CT scans can detect very small amounts of air in the mediastinum or subcutaneous tissues and can differentiate between pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium, which can be difficult to do on a chest X-ray.\nIn emergent situations, ultrasound may be helpful in identifying pneumomediastinum. The \u201cair gap sign\u201d may be present, which appears as broadband of sonographic echoes that obscure the cardiac structures beneath. Other findings may include air adjacent to the heart or diaphragm and subcutaneous hyperechoic white foci suggestive of air bubbles in the soft tissue.\nAdditional studies such as bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy, or esophagography are typically not required in most cases of pneumomediastinum. Obtaining these additional tests is warranted, given the clinical context. In blunt trauma, the absence of aerodigestive injury on multidetector CT in the setting of pneumomediastinum is adequate to rule out additional traumatic sequelae related to the aerodigestive system. However, posterior mediastinal air, the involvement of all mediastinal compartments, and concomitant hemothorax are associated with increased mortality in blunt trauma patients."

However, posterior mediastinal air, the involvement of all mediastinal compartments, and concomitant hemothorax are associated with increased mortality in blunt trauma patients. Treatment / Management\nMost patients with pneumomediastinum diagnosed on imaging studies ultimately prove not to have serious mediastinal organ injury and only require symptomatic management, as spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually self-limited and rarely recurs. These patients are typically well-appearing and hemodynamically stable. Treatment in these patients includes bed rest, oxygen administration as needed, antitussives, and analgesia. Prophylactic antibiotics are not typically needed in spontaneous pneumomediastinum but may be indicated in patients with aerodigestive injury secondary to trauma or instrumentation. Most spontaneous pneumomediastinum patients can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up or admitted for brief inpatient observation. Similarly, blunt trauma patients with isolated pneumomediastinum may also be able to be managed conservatively. In patients who are in distress, febrile, or with concern for secondary pneumomediastinum, hospital admission is indicated for observation, additional diagnostic testing, or surgery. Those with emesis, dysphagia, associated traumatic injuries, hemodynamic instability, pleural effusion, signs of infection, or pneumoperitoneum should undergo a contrast swallow study. Patients with extensive subcutaneous emphysema may necessitate surgical decompression, and those with pneumothorax may require chest tube placement. Finally, in patients presenting with malignant pneumomediastinum, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or thoracotomy may be necessary."
