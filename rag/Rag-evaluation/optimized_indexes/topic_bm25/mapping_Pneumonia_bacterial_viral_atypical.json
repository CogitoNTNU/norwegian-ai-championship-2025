Introduction\nPneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection that primarily affects the pulmonary parenchyma. Viruses, fungi, and bacteria can all cause pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia is caused by bacterial species less frequently associated with pneumonia compared to typical bacterial species, such as Gram-positive _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_. These atypical bacteria are also more difficult to detect using traditional Gram stain and standard culture methods. Examples of atypical bacteria include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Chlamydia_(formerly _Chlamydophila_)_pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species. Similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, the severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Atypical bacterial pneumonia affects all age groups and can account for up to 40% of community-acquired pneumonia cases. _M. pneumoniae_ alone is estimated to account for over 2 million cases and 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can cause mortality in both adults and children, and epidemics may occur every few years. Atypical bacteria are known to cause a disproportionate disease burden in children older than 5 and adolescents. These bacteria can initially present subacutely and progress to constitutional symptoms. Proper evaluation of suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia, including a detailed history, physical examination, and targeted investigations, is crucial for the interdisciplinary management of this condition.\nPlease see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Bacterial Pneumonia,\" for further information."

Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Bacterial Pneumonia,\" for further information. Etiology\nPneumonia is acquired when a sufficient volume of pathogenic organisms bypasses the body's cough and laryngeal reflexes to reach the parenchyma. This process can result from exposure to large volumes of pathogens in inspired air, increasingly virulent pathogen exposure, aspiration, or impaired host defenses. Given the various environments in which pneumonia can be acquired, the diagnosis is often broadly classified into community-acquired or hospital-acquired. Pneumonia may also be further classified as viral, bacterial, or atypical bacterial based on the pathogen identified for treatment. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can arise from various sources. The most commonly identified pathogens include:\n- _M. pneumoniae_ , often associated with close living conditions such as schools and military barracks\n- _Legionella_ _pneumophila_ from stagnant water sources\n- _L. longbeachae_ from potting mixes\n- _C. pneumoniae_\nOther atypical bacterial species may be associated with pneumonia depending on the geographical risk region. These species include:\n- _Coxiella burnetii_ and _Francisella tularensis_ from various mammalian sources\n- _C. psittaci_ from avian sources"

These species include:\n- _Coxiella burnetii_ and _Francisella tularensis_ from various mammalian sources\n- _C. psittaci_ from avian sources Epidemiology\nAn estimated 7% to 20% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are caused by atypical bacterial microorganisms. Due to their intracellular nature, these pathogens are not visible on Gram stain and are difficult to culture; therefore, the actual number of bacterial pneumonia cases attributable to atypical microorganisms is unknown, but given similar treatments, specific etiology is often unnecessary. Age is often the only reliable predictor in adults, though particular risk factors may exist for atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, as listed below. _M. pneumoniae_ is the most frequently identified microorganism associated with atypical bacterial respiratory infections. This microorganism can affect up to 50% of adolescents and is also prevalent among children older than 5 in crowded areas. A large multicenter study found _M. pneumoniae_ as a causative organism in up to 19% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in individuals aged 5 or older. In the United States, it has been reported as an attributable cause of community-acquired pneumonia in up to 32.5% of cases. Despite its prevalence, isolation of _M. pneumoniae_ may represent colonization rather than infection, especially in those with mild disease or asymptomatic carriage. An observational study conducted in the Netherlands involving 202 children found that isolated _M. pneumoniae was_ detected in 16.2% of children with suspected pneumonia. However, it was also found in 21% of asymptomatic children, suggesting a high seroprevalence in the population, consistent with other studies. _M. pneumoniae_ infections tend to be more common with advancing age, especially among older individuals, where it ranks second only to \\_S.\\__pneumoniae_ in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases. Symptoms may take 4 to 20 days to appear following exposure, which is spread via aerosols from human-to-human transmission."

Symptoms may take 4 to 20 days to appear following exposure, which is spread via aerosols from human-to-human transmission. The infection can occur year-round but is most frequently observed in the summer and fall in the United States and Asia. Outbreaks are common in small communities and enclosed spaces, such as schools and military barracks. The organism is transmitted from person to person, and the infection typically spreads slowly. Epidemics may occur every few years, lasting for prolonged periods. This pattern may be related to its longer incubation period and its ability to remain in the respiratory tract of infected hosts for long periods. _C. pneumoniae_ is also a common cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia, contributing to 6% to 20% of cases. Infections tend to occur in the summer and fall in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in Australia, they are most frequently observed in the fall. Transmission occurs through human-to-human contact but is inefficient, leading to most outbreaks being contained at the household level. Immunocompromised hosts are more at risk of infection and severe disease. However, the incubation period is long (approximately 3-4 weeks), symptoms are typically mild, and some patients may experience asymptomatic infection. Despite individuals aged 5 to 15 having a high rate of infection, _C. pneumoniae_ infection is common in older individuals and can result in higher mortality rates compared to younger populations. The prevalence of _C. pneumoniae_ infection increases with age, and seroprevalence indicating exposure is found in 50% of adults by 20 years of age, and >95% by 50 years of age. _L. pneumophila_ , unlike _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ , is not transmitted person-to-person, and infection typically occurs through host-environmental interactions, particularly with stagnant freshwater and artificial water systems. Contaminated drinking water, humidifiers, nebulizers, ventilation, and cooling systems have all been linked with cases of legionellosis. The incubation period can range anywhere from 2 to 10 days.

Pathophysiology\nAtypical bacteria that cause pneumonia are often obligate intracellular organisms, making them difficult to culture and identify on Gram stain. _M. pneumoniae_ ,_C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species are typically gram-negative bacteria, but each has unique virulence factors and characteristics that allow them to survive in hostile environments, including against host defenses. These bacteria are acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets, and, except _Legionella_ species, are transmitted from human to human. When the inoculating bacteria overwhelm the host defenses, it causes a proliferation of the infectious agent. The pathogen replication triggers the host immune response, leading to inflammation, alveolar irritation, and impairment. These immune responses result in the following signs and symptoms\u2014cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia infections result in less lobar consolidation and are more likely to be associated with interstitial and bronchopneumonia radiological changes on imaging. Therefore, many patients have subacute presentations and do not appear toxic in these cases; hence, the common term _walking pneumonia_ is typically associated with _M. pneumoniae._ However, this can be a misnomer, as _M. pneumoniae_ can still progress to shock and mechanical ventilation. Due to their intracellular nature, these infections are often challenging to treat because antibiotics must be able to penetrate intracellularly to reach their intended target."

History and Physical\nPatients often present with prolonged constitutional symptoms. Although not found to be predictive, it is traditionally taught that patients with atypical bacterial pneumonia infections present gradually, often accompanied by a viral prodrome that includes a sore throat, headache, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fevers. Atypical infections rarely have an obvious consolidation area on auscultation/imaging compared to pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, extra-cardiopulmonary symptoms are often observed; for example, _Mycoplasma_ infections have been associated with vasculitis and thrombosis, and _L._ _pneumophila_ is classically associated with gastrointestinal ailments and electrolyte abnormalities. Despite the classical thought that bullous myringitis is associated with _M. pneumoniae_ , it has been rarely documented in the literature compared to typical bacteria such as _S. pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_. _M. pneumoniae_ is a significant cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia. Symptoms may include malaise, cough, myalgia, and sore throat. The cough is often dry and worsens at night, often appearing as intractable. Most cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection are mild and resolve on their own. _M. pneumoniae_ can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cerebral ataxia. Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax, or even respiratory distress syndrome. A parapneumonic effusion can be associated with restricted chest expansion on the affected side. _C. pneumoniae_ infection commonly presents with a sore throat, cough, and headache, persisting for several weeks or even months. In some individuals, it can lead to pneumonia, otitis media, and bronchitis. Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evaluation\nIn a nontoxic-appearing patient, particularly in the outpatient setting, a high clinical suspicion is sufficient to pursue empiric treatment. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis, and sputum Gram stain may show an accumulation of inflammatory cells without any identifiable organisms. Urea levels may be elevated, and although leukocytosis may not always be present in most individuals, it is more likely to be elevated in older age groups. Other laboratory investigations, including serology and molecular testing, often complement and further help risk-stratify individuals and direct treatment. In addition to assessing leukocytosis, some providers may evaluate a left-shift typical of legionellosis or perform a procalcitonin test to help differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However, the yield of pro-calcitonin in the clinical setting is often mixed. _Legionella_ species infection may be associated with hyponatremia on electrolyte testing. Patients admitted to the hospital with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia should undergo urinary antigen testing for _L. pneumophila_ species, as _L. longbeachae_ may not be detected by this test. Swabs should also be taken to exclude viral causes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR). Depending on the setting and resources of the healthcare institution, PCR testing can also be run on multiplex panels that include atypical bacterial organisms, including _Legionella_ ,_Chlamydia_ , and _Mycoplasma_ ,\\_\\_ that appear equivalent to standard single-organism PCR and sequencing. Serology testing can be used to confirm cases, but given the time taken to obtain paired samples to analyze for immunoglobulin titer rise or seroconversion, these tests may not assist in the acute clinical setting."

In addition, it is important to obtain blood cultures to exclude associated bacteremia and, if necessary, collect deep sputum cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens to exclude typical bacterial infections and other infectious causes, such as viruses and fungi, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. These tests can also help identify the growth of atypical bacteria despite the lower yield compared to molecular testing. These efforts may ultimately assist with later antimicrobial rationalization and de-escalation of antibiotics once the patient has improved. In ill-appearing individuals or those in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a chest x-ray is the diagnostic gold standard. Classic imaging findings in atypical pneumonia include patchy infiltrates, sometimes bilateral in distribution, and interstitial patterns, but these may reflect worse changes than what the patient presents with. The chest x-ray may show a mild infiltrative process with hilar adenopathy. On computed tomography (CT) imaging, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodule formation, ground glass attenuation, and consolidation may be more evident in atypical bacterial pneumonia compared to typical bacterial pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia is less commonly associated with lobar consolidations and complicated parenchymal findings such as empyema. Severe manifestations may still occur with the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome and alveolar hemorrhage should still be considered in the critically unwell patient.

Treatment / Management\nAtypical organisms such as _M. pneumoniae_ , _C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species lack cell walls; therefore, beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy is not recommended. If the treating clinician suspects atypical bacterial pneumonia, empirical treatment may be warranted before further investigations, depending on the severity of illness in the patient. In more severe cases, investigations outlined in evaluating atypical bacterial pneumonia patients should be conducted to exclude other infectious causes, assess severity and microbiological burden, and guide antibiotic rationalization and stewardship practices. In moderate-to-severe cases, empirical antibiotics should be started within 4 hours and ideally as soon as possible in the setting of sepsis to reduce the risk of deterioration. First-line treatment for atypical bacterial pneumonia typically involves the macrolide family of antibiotics, although resistance is emerging. Azithromycin is the most common and is available in intravenous and oral formulations with similar bioavailability; the short treatment course of 3 to 5 days (500 mg on the first day, 250 mg subsequently) is tolerable in many patients and efficacious for mild-to-moderate disease. Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily is an alternative to azithromycin. Other outpatient antibiotics include fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily in the United States) and tetracycline (doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 5-7 days). However, guidelines often differ in their use based on local dispositions. For hospitalized patients with more severe cases, macrolides are often combined with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, depending on the severity of illness, to cover a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, intravenous fluoroquinolone monotherapy has been considered in some jurisdictions. In these instances, close cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes."

In these instances, close cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes. Despite these recommendations, clinicians often have challenges in understanding when to use combination therapy without guidelines. Clinician tools such as the CURB-65 or SMART-COP scores and the pneumonia severity index are frequently used to stratify management into outpatient management, admission, or intensive care admission. However, these tools are yet to supplant clinical judgment regarding the appropriate management of patients with pneumonia, including atypical bacterial pneumonia. Well-appearing individuals in whom an atypical organism is suspected can likely be managed with outpatient antibiotics and symptomatic care, while monitoring for potential complications. Treatment failures are common due to antibiotic resistance, poor patient compliance, and inability to tolerate oral medications, among other factors. In addition, some patients may have autoimmune conditions, primary respiratory pathology, or obstructing lung lesions/other opacities of non-infective etiology that may obscure consolidation, leading to an incorrect diagnosis. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may have a parapneumonic effusion on the chest x-ray or CT chest. If this fluid does not resolve, empyema may develop. Aspiration and fluid drainage are highly recommended if the pH is less than 7.2. In children younger than 5, atypical bacterial pathogens are less common, with the incidence and frequency of atypical pathogens increasing with age. Bacterial isolates may only be cultured less than 15% of the time, and less so for atypical pathogens, given the predominance of viral pathogens in children younger than 5. As such, the evidence for empirical coverage of atypical bacterial pneumonia in children remains uncertain. Of the bacterial causes of pneumonia, typical bacterial pathogens predominate. Therefore, when pneumonia is suspected in children younger than 5, the empirical outpatient treatment is amoxicillin, typically administered for 3 to 10 days. The data behind antimicrobial duration are historically arbitrary, and more recent randomized trials suggest shorter durations may be similar in efficacy to longer durations."

Amoxicillin/clavulanate and co-trimoxazole have shown efficacy comparable to amoxicillin in children and can be considered alternative antimicrobial therapies. Despite the uncertainty of evidence, the addition of clarithromycin or azithromycin can be considered for atypical bacteria in children if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours. Macrolides are recommended for children older than 5 for 10 days. Children who develop severe disease require parenteral therapy, which may include amoxicillin/clavulanate in addition to macrolides. In certain cases, fluoroquinolones may be an alternative, along with oxygen supplementation. Older patients with atypical pneumonia often have altered mental signs and underlying comorbidities, which increase their risk for aspiration. In these cases, anaerobic coverage should be considered. Broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial options include amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, or meropenem.

There is typically a complete resolution of symptoms and a low morbidity and mortality. Treatment is often uneventful in the absence of significant comorbid conditions, vital sign abnormalities, and a toxic appearance. As with all clinical diseases, not every case follows the expected course. Close follow-up and adherence with management strategies are necessary to monitor for disease progression. A smaller proportion of patients may require hospitalization due to disease progression, as indicated by the pneumonia severity index, SMART-COP, and CURB-65 scores. Several risk factors are associated with poorer outcomes, including an increased risk of early mortality. These factors include increased age, hypothermia, altered mental status, multilobar pneumonia, shock at presentation, preexisting congestive cardiac failure, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal impairment, and malnutrition. Death from atypical bacterial pneumonia is rare but can occur in patients with comorbidities and older individuals, with mortality rates reaching up to 11% among those admitted to intensive care."

An interprofessional team, including an emergency department physician, infectious disease consultant, nurse practitioner, internist, radiologist, and pharmacist, is key to effective management. Given the potential delays in diagnosis, treatment should not be postponed if atypical pneumonia is suspected and the patient is not improving.\nThe pharmacist should educate the patient on medication adherence and the importance of having the annual influenza vaccine among at-risk and older patients. Nurses should closely monitor patients for respiratory distress, nutrition, and mental status changes. For outpatient management, an infectious disease nurse should follow up with patients in a clinic to ensure proper recovery. If complications arise, the infectious disease physician should reassess the patient for appropriate management, with radiology involved in evaluating any related complications. To minimize morbidity and mortality, it is essential to monitor patients until complete resolution of symptoms is achieved.

However, this blind technique prevents direct sampling of the lung segments which have an infiltrate on the radiograph, and this may lead to increasing the false-negative rate. Also, contamination of the suction catheter, as it traverses the endotracheal tube and more proximal airways, may increase the false-positive rate. - _Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)_ allows the sampling of the lung segments which are suspected to be affected by pneumonia, decreasing the false-negative rate. But, the technique is operator dependent, and contamination of the bronchoscope can affect the results. Also, bronchoscopy can worsen hypoxemia which may not be tolerated by some patients. - _Protected specimen brush (PSB)_ can be advanced through a bronchoscope and has the advantage of avoiding contamination with upper airway secretions, as it is not advanced until positioned in the distal airway."

Introduction\nPneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection that primarily affects the pulmonary parenchyma. Viruses, fungi, and bacteria can all cause pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia is caused by bacterial species less frequently associated with pneumonia compared to typical bacterial species, such as Gram-positive _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_. These atypical bacteria are also more difficult to detect using traditional Gram stain and standard culture methods. Examples of atypical bacteria include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Chlamydia_(formerly _Chlamydophila_)_pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species. Similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, the severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Atypical bacterial pneumonia affects all age groups and can account for up to 40% of community-acquired pneumonia cases. _M. pneumoniae_ alone is estimated to account for over 2 million cases and 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can cause mortality in both adults and children, and epidemics may occur every few years. Atypical bacteria are known to cause a disproportionate disease burden in children older than 5 and adolescents. These bacteria can initially present subacutely and progress to constitutional symptoms. Proper evaluation of suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia, including a detailed history, physical examination, and targeted investigations, is crucial for the interdisciplinary management of this condition.\nPlease see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Bacterial Pneumonia,\" for further information."

Please see StatPearls' companion resource, \"Bacterial Pneumonia,\" for further information. Etiology\nPneumonia is acquired when a sufficient volume of pathogenic organisms bypasses the body's cough and laryngeal reflexes to reach the parenchyma. This process can result from exposure to large volumes of pathogens in inspired air, increasingly virulent pathogen exposure, aspiration, or impaired host defenses. Given the various environments in which pneumonia can be acquired, the diagnosis is often broadly classified into community-acquired or hospital-acquired. Pneumonia may also be further classified as viral, bacterial, or atypical bacterial based on the pathogen identified for treatment. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can arise from various sources. The most commonly identified pathogens include:\n- _M. pneumoniae_ , often associated with close living conditions such as schools and military barracks\n- _Legionella_ _pneumophila_ from stagnant water sources\n- _L. longbeachae_ from potting mixes\n- _C. pneumoniae_\nOther atypical bacterial species may be associated with pneumonia depending on the geographical risk region. These species include:\n- _Coxiella burnetii_ and _Francisella tularensis_ from various mammalian sources\n- _C. psittaci_ from avian sources"

These species include:\n- _Coxiella burnetii_ and _Francisella tularensis_ from various mammalian sources\n- _C. psittaci_ from avian sources Epidemiology\nAn estimated 7% to 20% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are caused by atypical bacterial microorganisms. Due to their intracellular nature, these pathogens are not visible on Gram stain and are difficult to culture; therefore, the actual number of bacterial pneumonia cases attributable to atypical microorganisms is unknown, but given similar treatments, specific etiology is often unnecessary. Age is often the only reliable predictor in adults, though particular risk factors may exist for atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, as listed below. _M. pneumoniae_ is the most frequently identified microorganism associated with atypical bacterial respiratory infections. This microorganism can affect up to 50% of adolescents and is also prevalent among children older than 5 in crowded areas. A large multicenter study found _M. pneumoniae_ as a causative organism in up to 19% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in individuals aged 5 or older. In the United States, it has been reported as an attributable cause of community-acquired pneumonia in up to 32.5% of cases. Despite its prevalence, isolation of _M. pneumoniae_ may represent colonization rather than infection, especially in those with mild disease or asymptomatic carriage. An observational study conducted in the Netherlands involving 202 children found that isolated _M. pneumoniae was_ detected in 16.2% of children with suspected pneumonia. However, it was also found in 21% of asymptomatic children, suggesting a high seroprevalence in the population, consistent with other studies. _M. pneumoniae_ infections tend to be more common with advancing age, especially among older individuals, where it ranks second only to \\_S.\\__pneumoniae_ in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases. Symptoms may take 4 to 20 days to appear following exposure, which is spread via aerosols from human-to-human transmission."

Symptoms may take 4 to 20 days to appear following exposure, which is spread via aerosols from human-to-human transmission. The infection can occur year-round but is most frequently observed in the summer and fall in the United States and Asia. Outbreaks are common in small communities and enclosed spaces, such as schools and military barracks. The organism is transmitted from person to person, and the infection typically spreads slowly. Epidemics may occur every few years, lasting for prolonged periods. This pattern may be related to its longer incubation period and its ability to remain in the respiratory tract of infected hosts for long periods. _C. pneumoniae_ is also a common cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia, contributing to 6% to 20% of cases. Infections tend to occur in the summer and fall in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in Australia, they are most frequently observed in the fall. Transmission occurs through human-to-human contact but is inefficient, leading to most outbreaks being contained at the household level. Immunocompromised hosts are more at risk of infection and severe disease. However, the incubation period is long (approximately 3-4 weeks), symptoms are typically mild, and some patients may experience asymptomatic infection. Despite individuals aged 5 to 15 having a high rate of infection, _C. pneumoniae_ infection is common in older individuals and can result in higher mortality rates compared to younger populations. The prevalence of _C. pneumoniae_ infection increases with age, and seroprevalence indicating exposure is found in 50% of adults by 20 years of age, and >95% by 50 years of age. _L. pneumophila_ , unlike _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ , is not transmitted person-to-person, and infection typically occurs through host-environmental interactions, particularly with stagnant freshwater and artificial water systems. Contaminated drinking water, humidifiers, nebulizers, ventilation, and cooling systems have all been linked with cases of legionellosis. The incubation period can range anywhere from 2 to 10 days.

Pathophysiology\nAtypical bacteria that cause pneumonia are often obligate intracellular organisms, making them difficult to culture and identify on Gram stain. _M. pneumoniae_ ,_C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species are typically gram-negative bacteria, but each has unique virulence factors and characteristics that allow them to survive in hostile environments, including against host defenses. These bacteria are acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets, and, except _Legionella_ species, are transmitted from human to human. When the inoculating bacteria overwhelm the host defenses, it causes a proliferation of the infectious agent. The pathogen replication triggers the host immune response, leading to inflammation, alveolar irritation, and impairment. These immune responses result in the following signs and symptoms\u2014cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia infections result in less lobar consolidation and are more likely to be associated with interstitial and bronchopneumonia radiological changes on imaging. Therefore, many patients have subacute presentations and do not appear toxic in these cases; hence, the common term _walking pneumonia_ is typically associated with _M. pneumoniae._ However, this can be a misnomer, as _M. pneumoniae_ can still progress to shock and mechanical ventilation. Due to their intracellular nature, these infections are often challenging to treat because antibiotics must be able to penetrate intracellularly to reach their intended target."

History and Physical\nPatients often present with prolonged constitutional symptoms. Although not found to be predictive, it is traditionally taught that patients with atypical bacterial pneumonia infections present gradually, often accompanied by a viral prodrome that includes a sore throat, headache, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fevers. Atypical infections rarely have an obvious consolidation area on auscultation/imaging compared to pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, extra-cardiopulmonary symptoms are often observed; for example, _Mycoplasma_ infections have been associated with vasculitis and thrombosis, and _L._ _pneumophila_ is classically associated with gastrointestinal ailments and electrolyte abnormalities. Despite the classical thought that bullous myringitis is associated with _M. pneumoniae_ , it has been rarely documented in the literature compared to typical bacteria such as _S. pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_. _M. pneumoniae_ is a significant cause of atypical bacterial pneumonia. Symptoms may include malaise, cough, myalgia, and sore throat. The cough is often dry and worsens at night, often appearing as intractable. Most cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection are mild and resolve on their own. _M. pneumoniae_ can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cerebral ataxia. Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax, or even respiratory distress syndrome. A parapneumonic effusion can be associated with restricted chest expansion on the affected side. _C. pneumoniae_ infection commonly presents with a sore throat, cough, and headache, persisting for several weeks or even months. In some individuals, it can lead to pneumonia, otitis media, and bronchitis. Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Besides acute infection, _C. pneumoniae_ can also cause chronic infection in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evaluation\nIn a nontoxic-appearing patient, particularly in the outpatient setting, a high clinical suspicion is sufficient to pursue empiric treatment. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis, and sputum Gram stain may show an accumulation of inflammatory cells without any identifiable organisms. Urea levels may be elevated, and although leukocytosis may not always be present in most individuals, it is more likely to be elevated in older age groups. Other laboratory investigations, including serology and molecular testing, often complement and further help risk-stratify individuals and direct treatment. In addition to assessing leukocytosis, some providers may evaluate a left-shift typical of legionellosis or perform a procalcitonin test to help differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However, the yield of pro-calcitonin in the clinical setting is often mixed. _Legionella_ species infection may be associated with hyponatremia on electrolyte testing. Patients admitted to the hospital with suspected atypical bacterial pneumonia should undergo urinary antigen testing for _L. pneumophila_ species, as _L. longbeachae_ may not be detected by this test. Swabs should also be taken to exclude viral causes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR). Depending on the setting and resources of the healthcare institution, PCR testing can also be run on multiplex panels that include atypical bacterial organisms, including _Legionella_ ,_Chlamydia_ , and _Mycoplasma_ ,\\_\\_ that appear equivalent to standard single-organism PCR and sequencing. Serology testing can be used to confirm cases, but given the time taken to obtain paired samples to analyze for immunoglobulin titer rise or seroconversion, these tests may not assist in the acute clinical setting."

These tests can also help identify the growth of atypical bacteria despite the lower yield compared to molecular testing. These efforts may ultimately assist with later antimicrobial rationalization and de-escalation of antibiotics once the patient has improved. In ill-appearing individuals or those in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a chest x-ray is the diagnostic gold standard. Classic imaging findings in atypical pneumonia include patchy infiltrates, sometimes bilateral in distribution, and interstitial patterns, but these may reflect worse changes than what the patient presents with. The chest x-ray may show a mild infiltrative process with hilar adenopathy. On computed tomography (CT) imaging, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodule formation, ground glass attenuation, and consolidation may be more evident in atypical bacterial pneumonia compared to typical bacterial pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia is less commonly associated with lobar consolidations and complicated parenchymal findings such as empyema. Severe manifestations may still occur with the atypical bacterial pneumonia organisms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome and alveolar hemorrhage should still be considered in the critically unwell patient.

Treatment / Management\nAtypical organisms such as _M. pneumoniae_ , _C. pneumoniae_ , and _Legionella_ species lack cell walls; therefore, beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy is not recommended. If the treating clinician suspects atypical bacterial pneumonia, empirical treatment may be warranted before further investigations, depending on the severity of illness in the patient. In more severe cases, investigations outlined in evaluating atypical bacterial pneumonia patients should be conducted to exclude other infectious causes, assess severity and microbiological burden, and guide antibiotic rationalization and stewardship practices. In moderate-to-severe cases, empirical antibiotics should be started within 4 hours and ideally as soon as possible in the setting of sepsis to reduce the risk of deterioration. First-line treatment for atypical bacterial pneumonia typically involves the macrolide family of antibiotics, although resistance is emerging. Azithromycin is the most common and is available in intravenous and oral formulations with similar bioavailability; the short treatment course of 3 to 5 days (500 mg on the first day, 250 mg subsequently) is tolerable in many patients and efficacious for mild-to-moderate disease. Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily is an alternative to azithromycin. Other outpatient antibiotics include fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily in the United States) and tetracycline (doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 5-7 days). However, guidelines often differ in their use based on local dispositions. For hospitalized patients with more severe cases, macrolides are often combined with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, depending on the severity of illness, to cover a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, intravenous fluoroquinolone monotherapy has been considered in some jurisdictions. In these instances, close cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes."

In these instances, close cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes. Despite these recommendations, clinicians often have challenges in understanding when to use combination therapy without guidelines. Clinician tools such as the CURB-65 or SMART-COP scores and the pneumonia severity index are frequently used to stratify management into outpatient management, admission, or intensive care admission. However, these tools are yet to supplant clinical judgment regarding the appropriate management of patients with pneumonia, including atypical bacterial pneumonia. Well-appearing individuals in whom an atypical organism is suspected can likely be managed with outpatient antibiotics and symptomatic care, while monitoring for potential complications. Treatment failures are common due to antibiotic resistance, poor patient compliance, and inability to tolerate oral medications, among other factors. In addition, some patients may have autoimmune conditions, primary respiratory pathology, or obstructing lung lesions/other opacities of non-infective etiology that may obscure consolidation, leading to an incorrect diagnosis. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may have a parapneumonic effusion on the chest x-ray or CT chest. If this fluid does not resolve, empyema may develop. Aspiration and fluid drainage are highly recommended if the pH is less than 7.2. In children younger than 5, atypical bacterial pathogens are less common, with the incidence and frequency of atypical pathogens increasing with age. Bacterial isolates may only be cultured less than 15% of the time, and less so for atypical pathogens, given the predominance of viral pathogens in children younger than 5. As such, the evidence for empirical coverage of atypical bacterial pneumonia in children remains uncertain. Of the bacterial causes of pneumonia, typical bacterial pathogens predominate. Therefore, when pneumonia is suspected in children younger than 5, the empirical outpatient treatment is amoxicillin, typically administered for 3 to 10 days. The data behind antimicrobial duration are historically arbitrary, and more recent randomized trials suggest shorter durations may be similar in efficacy to longer durations."

Amoxicillin/clavulanate and co-trimoxazole have shown efficacy comparable to amoxicillin in children and can be considered alternative antimicrobial therapies. Despite the uncertainty of evidence, the addition of clarithromycin or azithromycin can be considered for atypical bacteria in children if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours. Macrolides are recommended for children older than 5 for 10 days. Children who develop severe disease require parenteral therapy, which may include amoxicillin/clavulanate in addition to macrolides. In certain cases, fluoroquinolones may be an alternative, along with oxygen supplementation.

There is typically a complete resolution of symptoms and a low morbidity and mortality. Treatment is often uneventful in the absence of significant comorbid conditions, vital sign abnormalities, and a toxic appearance. As with all clinical diseases, not every case follows the expected course. Close follow-up and adherence with management strategies are necessary to monitor for disease progression. A smaller proportion of patients may require hospitalization due to disease progression, as indicated by the pneumonia severity index, SMART-COP, and CURB-65 scores. Several risk factors are associated with poorer outcomes, including an increased risk of early mortality. These factors include increased age, hypothermia, altered mental status, multilobar pneumonia, shock at presentation, preexisting congestive cardiac failure, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal impairment, and malnutrition. Death from atypical bacterial pneumonia is rare but can occur in patients with comorbidities and older individuals, with mortality rates reaching up to 11% among those admitted to intensive care."

An interprofessional team, including an emergency department physician, infectious disease consultant, nurse practitioner, internist, radiologist, and pharmacist, is key to effective management. Given the potential delays in diagnosis, treatment should not be postponed if atypical pneumonia is suspected and the patient is not improving.\nThe pharmacist should educate the patient on medication adherence and the importance of having the annual influenza vaccine among at-risk and older patients. Nurses should closely monitor patients for respiratory distress, nutrition, and mental status changes. For outpatient management, an infectious disease nurse should follow up with patients in a clinic to ensure proper recovery. If complications arise, the infectious disease physician should reassess the patient for appropriate management, with radiology involved in evaluating any related complications.

Epidemiology\nThe estimated worldwide incidence of community-acquired pneumonia varies between 1.5 to 14 cases per 1000 person-years and is affected by geography, season, and population characteristics. In the US the annual incidence is 24.8 cases per 10,000 adults, with higher rates as age increases. Pneumonia is the eighth leading cause of death and first among infectious causes of death. The mortality rate is as high as 23% for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for severe pneumonia.\nAll patients with comorbid illness are considered at risk for pneumonia, but specific risk factors exist for particular pathogens. Drug-resistant pneumococci are more likely in:\n- Those older than 65\n- Children in daycare centers\n- Those who have taken beta-lactam antibiotics in the previous 90 days\n- Individuals with alcohol use disorder, chronic medical conditions, and immune suppression\nPseudomonas pneumonia is more likely in those with:\n- Bronchiectasis\n- Malnutrition\n- Corticosteroid therapy\n- Antibiotic intake for greater than 7 days in the preceding month\nOther etiological clues from geographic regions include the following:\n- Coccidioidomycosis in the Southwestern US\n- Blastomycosis or histoplasmosis in the states of the Ohio River valley bird exposures for _Chlamydia psittaci_\n- Contact with flea-infested or infected rodents or rabbits during outside activities such as lawn mowing in the Northeast US (Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, etc) for tularemia pneumonia"

Treatment / Management\nMonotherapy with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin), amoxicillin, or doxycycline is recommended in the outpatient setting. In the presence of comorbid illness (chronic heart disease excluding hypertension); chronic lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma); chronic liver disease; chronic alcohol use disorder; diabetes mellitus; smoking; splenectomy; human immunodeficiency virus (or other immunosuppression); a respiratory fluoroquinolone (high-dose levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin); a combination of oral beta-lactam (high dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime); and macrolide is recommended. Inpatient management is recommended for patients with a CURB 65 score greater than or equal to 2. A respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy or combination therapy with beta-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem) and macrolide are recommended options for non-intensive care settings. Admission to the intensive care unit must be considered in patients with 3 or more signs of early deterioration. These include respiratory rate greater than 30, PaO2/FiO2 less than or equal to 250, multilobar infiltrates, encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, leucopenia, and hypotension. Combination therapy with a beta-lactam and either a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended. In patients with suspected aspiration, ampicillin-sulbactam or ertapenem can be used. Monotherapy is not recommended. If risk factors for Pseudomonas are present, then antipseudomonal beta-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem) along with either an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or a combination of aminoglycoside and azithromycin are recommended.

The recommended duration of therapy is 5 to 7 days in patients with a favorable clinical response, such as the absence of fever for more than 48 to 72 hours, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and resolution of tachycardia, tachypnea, or hypotension. Prolongation of therapy is indicated in patients with a delayed response, specific bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas (14-21 days) or _S aureus_ (7-21 days), or Legionella pneumonia (14 days), and for complications such as empyema, lung abscess, or necrotizing pneumonia. Chest tube placement will be needed to drain an empyema, and in cases with multiple loculations, a surgical decortication may be needed.

A 5-day therapy with oseltamivir is recommended for all patients who test positive for the influenza virus and present within 48 hours of symptom onset; there is no benefit to oseltamivir if started beyond 48 hours after symptom onset. Still, any hospitalized patients with influenza must be treated with this agent regardless of the presentation time from the beginning of the illness.

Pearls and Other Issues\nVaccine recommendations evolve in parallel with changing epidemiology vaccine developments and formulation advancements. All adults 65 years and older and those younger than 65 and considered at risk for pneumonia must receive a pneumococcal vaccination (PCV). The 2 vaccines used until 2021 were the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) 23 and PCV13. In summer 2021, the US FDA approved 2 additional preparations, PCV20 and PCV15, for adult vaccinations. Since then, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations favored using these latter formulations for adult vaccinations. Current ACIP recommendations for previously unvaccinated, non-immune-compromised individuals who are at least aged 65 years, as well as those between 19 to 64 years with risk factors for pneumonia, receive either PCV20 alone or PCV15 coupled with PPSV23 one year later. For adults who already had vaccinations with prior formulations (PCV13 or PPSV23), subsequent options are different. Those who received only PCV13 can be followed by PPSV23 vaccination a year later. If the prior vaccine was only with PPSV23, then after a year, either PCV20 alone or PCV15 followed a year later with another PPSV23 can be given. The 1-year interval between pneumococcal doses can be shortened to 8 weeks for immunocompromised individuals. Influenza vaccination is recommended for all adult patients at risk for influenza-related complications. Inactivated flu shots (trivalent or quadrivalent, egg-based or recombinant) are usually recommended for adults. Live attenuated intranasal vaccine can be given to healthy, nonpregnant adults under 49. This is contraindicated in pregnancy, the immune-suppressed and health care workers caring for them, and in those with comorbidities."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nPatients with community-acquired pneumonia may present to the clinician or the emergency department. The medical staff should be aware of the signs and symptoms associated with pneumonia. Working together, the healthcare team will improve outcomes. Members can include primary care, emergency department personnel, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists. Most patients respond to outpatient antibiotic therapy for 5 to 7 days. Patients who are short of breath, febrile, and in respiratory distress need to be admitted. An infectious disease or pulmonology consult is recommended if the diagnosis is unclear. Some patients may present with a parapneumonic effusion, which may require drainage. Typically, nurses monitor the patients and report current status and updates to the rest of the team. Pharmacists evaluate medication choices, check for allergies and drug interactions, and educate patients about possible side effects and the importance of compliance.\nThe providers should encourage all patients to get the annual influenza vaccine. In addition, all adults 65 and older and those considered at risk for pneumonia must receive the pneumococcal vaccination. The outcomes in most patients with community-acquired pneumonia are favorable."

    "text": "Introduction\nViral pneumonia is defined as a disease entity wherein there is the viral causation of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange abnormalities at the level of the alveoli, secondary to viral-mediated and/or immune response-mediated inflammation. The traditional role of viral pneumonia was as a disease found predominantly in the very young, the elderly, and those exposed to influenza. In the past, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was predicated on it being somewhat a diagnosis of exclusion. History, physical exam, chest radiography, and available lab work (until recently) lacked sensitivity and specificity. Once bacterial pneumonia has been excluded, then viral pneumonia diagnosis was entertained. Traditionally, the treatment of viral pneumonia revolved around supportive care:\n- Supplemental oxygen when indicated\n- Airway augmentation as appropriate\n- Monitoring of and replacement of any fluid deficits\n- Symptomatic control of temperature and cough\n- Rest to reduce oxygen demand\n- Treatment of any comorbidities and/or concomitant bacterial pneumonia\nThe concepts of diagnosis, prevalence, clinical role, and treatment of viral pneumonia are in flux for several reasons. 1\\. There is a growing population at increased risk of viral pneumonia:\n- The increases in life span and early infant survivability have created an additional population at greater risk of viral pneumonia. - The increased number of those receiving immune-impairing therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy) for cancer. - The increased use of disease-modifying hematological/immunological agents in chronic illness, resulting in secondary impaired immunity. - The advent of HIV\n- The increase in the number of patients with inborn immune impairment serving bacterial infection secondary to antibiotic therapy. - The increased incidence of organ transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy. 2\\. The availability of sensitive, specific, real-time-result-available testing for viral entities:\n- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is replacing viral cultures and serial viral antigen titers."

The availability of sensitive, specific, real-time-result-available testing for viral entities:\n- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is replacing viral cultures and serial viral antigen titers. Both viral culture results and serial antigen testing were problematic because test results were not available until weeks after the acute illness, and viral culturing for pneumonia could involve invasive sampling techniques to acquire. - The availability of PCR testing has resulted in increased testing in general. - The mechanism of PCR itself is more sensitive and specific because many viruses are notoriously difficult to grow in culture and are very sample dependent. 3\\. The positive feedback loop that results from improved viral pneumonia testing modalities:\n- The test availability results in an increased number of diagnoses. - The increased number of diagnosis raises the clinical index of suspicion for the entity. - The increased clinical index of suspicion raises the number of tests ordered. 4\\. The availability of safe, tolerable, and somewhat specific antiviral therapies:\n- Prior viral pneumonia treatment was essentially supportive measures only. - Initial efforts at antiviral therapy were not well tolerated. - The availability of some specific and effective treatments now spur earlier testing and a greater appreciation of the role of viral infection in pneumonia. - Disease-modifying therapy for HIV is now available. 5\\. The increasing role of viral pathogens in pneumonia and the increased realization of the role of bacterial and viral co-infection necessitate a higher clinical index of suspicion and early identification of viral pulmonary pathogens. Counterbalance seeing this new clinical burden is the availability of the following:\n- Enhanced laboratory detection via ELISA and PCR testing modalities\n- Enhanced radiographic detection for a high thin section CAT scan\n- An increasing number of safe and efficacious antiviral drugs\n- Increased recognition of the role of prevention in viral infectious disease."

There is a steep decline in the incidence of viral pneumonia from adolescence through the fifth or sixth decade of life. Then an upsurge as age-related immunosuppression and age-related pathologies result in immunosuppression increase.\n**Pregnancy** - Viral pneumonia continues to be quite concerning in pregnancy. Of particular concern is influenza-related pneumonia secondary to the ubiquitous nature of influenza from late fall to late spring; the last two major flu epidemics, 1918 and 1957, produced respective mortality rates of 50% and 10%. This increased mortality is a major factor in the CDC recommendation that all otherwise healthy women receive an inactivated influenza virus vaccine during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An additional, though less common, cause of viral pneumonia in pregnant women is varicella. Limited data reflects a very substantial mortality rate, and current recommendations are for treatment with varicella-zoster immune globulin within 96 hours of exposure to varicella in a non-immune gravid female.\n**Immune competence** - Decreased immune competence can be a result of the following:\n- Chemotherapy (and/or) radiation therapy for neoplasm\n- Treatment of chronic inflammatory illness with immunosuppressive therapy\n- Organ transplantation requiring immunosuppressive medications\n- Acquired immune incompetence secondary to HIV\n- Inherited diseases of diminished immune competency\nThe aforementioned may result in increased susceptibility to viral pneumonia.\n**Comorbid circumstances** _-_ A number of comorbid circumstances can predispose patients to viral pneumonia including:\n- Trauma\n- Severe burns\n- Uncontrolled diabetes\n- Malnutrition\n- Poverty\n- Environmental exposure\n- Group living"

    "text": "Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAn interprofessional team of healthcare workers manages viral pneumonia. While physicians may treat the infection, the role of the nurse and pharmacist are vital for prevention. The patient should be urged to get the annual influenza vaccine, as this can lower the morbidity and mortality. Pharmacists review prescriptions for dose and interactions and educate patients about side effects and the importance of compliance. All patients should be urged to quit smoking and abstain from alcohol. Further, patients should be educated about hand and personal hygiene to prevent transmission of the virus to others. Patients who are immunocompromised should be educated about the symptoms of pneumonia and when to seek medical care. Finally, patients should be urged to lead a healthy lifestyle, eat healthily, and exercise regularly. Close communication between the interprofessional team is essential if one wants to improve outcomes.  (Level 5)\n**Outcomes**\nThe outcomes in most healthy people with viral pneumonia are excellent. However, in individuals who are immunocompromised or at extremes of age, the prognosis is guarded. Several adenovirus serotypes are known to cause severe pneumonia leading to bronchiectasis and irreversible atelectasis. It is estimated that anywhere from 10%-40% of children may suffer some irreversible lung damage after adenovirus pneumonia. Viral pneumonia in a patient with an underlying disease can add morbidity and lead to marked hypoxia. Overall, most patients recover with supportive measures and have no residual sequelae. \\18\\"
