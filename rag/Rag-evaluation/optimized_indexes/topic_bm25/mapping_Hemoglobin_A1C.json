    "text": "Testing Procedures\nNumerous analytical techniques have been developed to quantify HbA1c, each offering specific advantages in precision and applicability. To ensure global consistency, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) established a reference system for HbA1c measurement. This system uses primary reference materials composed of purified HbA1c and HbA0, with 2 proposed reference methods\u2014electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis. These reference methods target the glycated N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin \u03b2-chain. The process involves enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C to release the N-terminal hexapeptide, followed by separation and quantification of glycated and non-glycated hexapeptides. HbA1c is expressed as the ratio of glycated to total hexapeptides. A network of IFCC-designated reference laboratories maintains and supports this standardized framework, ensuring its reliability for assay calibration. Comparative analyses of the IFCC system with the NGSP and other regional standards demonstrate robust correlation, enabling manufacturers to align their assays with the IFCC reference method. However, HbA1c values derived from IFCC methods are typically 1.5% to 2% lower than NGSP values due to differences in the glycated fractions measured. The IFCC method is not intended for routine clinical use but is a calibration standard for commercial assays. For clinical testing, NGSP-certified methods are recommended. In laboratory settings, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using cation-exchange chromatography remains a cornerstone technique for HbA1c measurement. This method effectively removes labile intermediates that may interfere with alternative approaches, such as immunoassays or affinity chromatography. Fully automated HPLC systems are widely available, requiring minimal sample volumes (approximately 5 \u03bcL of whole blood). Although venous blood is standard, capillary blood from a finger prick is also acceptable. Samples are diluted with a borate-containing hemolysis reagent and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to eliminate labile Schiff bases before analysis."

Samples are diluted with a borate-containing hemolysis reagent and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to eliminate labile Schiff bases before analysis. Immunoassay-based methods are also prevalent, using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the Amadori product (ketoamine linkage) and distinct amino acid sequences at the N-terminal of the hemoglobin \u03b2-chain. A widely used format, latex agglutination inhibition, involves a synthetic polymer bearing HbA1c epitopes that competes with patient HbA1c for binding to antibody-coated latex beads. This competition reduces agglutination, which is quantifiable as decreased absorbance. Enzyme immunoassays using analogous antibodies exhibit acceptable precision and are typically calibrated to HPLC-derived values. These assays are highly specific, excluding labile intermediates; other glycated hemoglobin, such as HbA1a and HbA1b; and common hemoglobin variants, such as HbF, HbA2, HbS, and carbamylated hemoglobin. Recent advancements have introduced enzymatic assays using fructosyl peptide oxidase for HbA1c quantification, alongside automated liquid-flow capillary electrophoresis systems, which provide viable alternatives for routine clinical testing. POC devices are increasingly used for HbA1c measurement in clinical settings. However, the diversity of available POC systems complicates selection, as comparative performance data are limited. Notably, POC measurements typically yield values approximately 0.5% lower than laboratory-based assays and may exhibit reduced accuracy compared to venous blood samples analyzed in a laboratory. Inter-laboratory variability in HbA1c results can reach 0.5%, underscoring the importance of standardized methodologies to ensure reliable clinical outcomes."

Inter-laboratory variability in HbA1c results can reach 0.5%, underscoring the importance of standardized methodologies to ensure reliable clinical outcomes. Interfering Factors\nSeveral conditions can interfere with the accuracy of HbA1c testing. Individuals with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, anemia, kidney failure, liver disease, or those receiving blood transfusions can experience altered results due to the longevity of the red blood cell. HbA1c measurement in these patients must be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with plasma glucose samples to diagnose diabetes mellitus. A falsely low HbA1c value can result from several conditions, including high altitude, pregnancy, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, erythropoietin administration, iron supplementation, hemolytic anemia, chronic kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, sickle cell anemia, and spherocytosis. Vitamin C supplementation can increase or decrease HbA1c levels depending on the method used.\nConversely, a falsely high HbA1c value can be due to insufficient iron in the blood. This condition can result from iron deficiency anemia, infection-induced or tumor-induced anemia. In addition, hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and B12 deficiency can cause a falsely high HbA1c value. Other causes of falsely high HbA1c levels include hypertriglyceridemia, organ transplantation, and hyperglycation in certain ethnic groups. Medications such as immunosuppressants and protease inhibitors can sometimes lead to a falsely high HbA1c value."

Quality Control and Lab Safety\nThe laboratory must develop, document, implement, and maintain a comprehensive quality management system to ensure all processes adhere to established quality standards and consistently deliver reliable results. For HbA1c testing, both internal and external quality control are vital elements of this system, directly contributing to the accuracy and consistency of reported outcomes. Internal quality control focuses on monitoring the analytical phase of the testing process. According to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments guidelines, a minimum of 2 quality control levels must be performed every 24 hours for routine laboratory assays. Although manufacturers provide control ranges, laboratories are encouraged to define them based on internal data and relevant guidelines to optimize performance. Quality control results should be charted using Levey-Jennings plots, with appropriate Westgard rules applied. If any control rule is violated, patient testing must be halted immediately, appropriate corrective actions implemented, and testing resumed only after control results return to acceptable limits. External quality assessment, or proficiency testing, offers an objective evaluation of laboratory performance. Participating laboratories receive blinded samples from an external organization, submit their results, and have them statistically analyzed and compared against peer groups. For HbA1c, the College of American Pathologists provides an accuracy-based external quality assurance program that promotes interlaboratory consistency and helps identify areas needing improvement. Given that HbA1c exhibits low within-subject biological variation, typically \\<2%, the ADA recommends that intralaboratory imprecision maintain a coefficient of variation (CV) below 2%, and interlaboratory CV should not exceed 3.5%. Meeting these precision standards guarantees the reliability and clinical significance of test results. Laboratory safety is equally critical to overall testing quality."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAll clinicians caring for patients with diabetes mellitus need a thorough understanding of HbA1c and its clinical significance. In general, HbA1c reflects the average glucose concentration over 3 months. HbA1c is often used as an outcome measure to determine whether an intervention in a population is successful by demonstrating a decrease in HbA1c by a specific percentage. There is a movement within the medical community to shift away from using HbA1c as an exclusive standard of care test to assess patient response to treatment. The newest proposed methods include the estimated average glucose and the glucose time in range. These methods use data obtained from continuous glucose monitors that record blood glucose levels around the clock. In addition, these methods can offer healthcare professionals a more accurate picture of the blood sugar average and fluctuations. However, these methods are not available to all patients on a widespread basis. According to ADA guidelines, HbA1c levels should be measured 2 times annually in stable patients and at least 4 times in patients with glucose fluctuations or those who have changed their diabetes treatment. HbA1c is one of the preferred diabetes diagnostic tests today. The blood draw can occur anytime, and no special handling requirements exist. However, to ensure that the A1c value is correct, clinicians must be aware of the causes of false-positive and false-negative results. As many patients with diabetes mellitus are treated in outpatient settings, diabetes care nurses must understand HbA1c results and know when to refer patients to an endocrinologist for further evaluation."
