    "text": "Treatment / Management\nTreatment of chronic stable angina is aimed at managing symptoms as well as slowing the progression to cardiac events. Management is multifactorial and involves lifestyle modifications, risk factor modification, and medical therapy as essential components of treatment. In cases in which symptoms are refractory to medical therapy, revascularization may be attempted; however, although it may be successful in controlling symptoms, it is not shown to reduce major cardiovascular events compared with medical therapy. Lifestyle modifications include regular exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation, which should be encouraged. Risk factor modification includes controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Medications for risk factor modification and to prevent disease progression include aspirin, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. Medical therapy can be used to control symptoms as well as help mitigate the risk of the progression of atherosclerosis and cardiac events. Antianginal agents can be separated based on the mechanism of symptom relief in angina. In general, symptomatic control is achieved by way of decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption. As heart rate is the main influencer of oxygen consumption, most anginal events are initiated by an increase in heart rate. Three classes of drugs used for angina reduce symptoms by way of heart rate reduction\u2014 beta-blockers, ivabradine, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and decreased ejection fraction. Another mechanism by which anginal symptoms can be treated is vascular smooth muscle relaxation. This leads to coronary artery dilatation, thereby increasing perfusion ability. The drugs that work on this mechanism are dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and nicorandil. Another drug used for chronic stable angina is ranolazine, which inhibits the late sodium current in ventricular myocardial cells. This reduces diastolic contractile dysfunction. Treatment for unstable angina is aimed at pain reduction, limiting damage to the myocardium, and decreasing morbidity and mortality."

Treatment for unstable angina is aimed at pain reduction, limiting damage to the myocardium, and decreasing morbidity and mortality. **Nitrates** - no mortality benefit, but used for chest pain relief. They cause vasodilation, which decreases preload and left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. They are contraindicated in cases of hypotension and previous use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors within the past 48 hours. **Morphine** - no mortality benefit, used for pain relief when pain relief is not fully achieved by nitrates. It causes some vasodilation aside from analgesia. **Beta-blockers** - reduce mortality. They cause a decrease in heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand. **Antiplatelet agents** - dual therapy with aspirin and either clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes\u2014 acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and stroke. **Anticoagulants** - reduce mortality by decreasing re-infarction rates in combination with antiplatelet agents. Used intravenously for acute treatment. **Anatomic assessment of coronary arteries/consideration of revascularization** - high-risk patients should be identified with risk stratification methods and considered for urgent revascularization."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nRecognizing the symptoms of angina is critical to making a diagnosis of CAD, but similar symptoms can present in many other conditions. The interprofessional team must recognize signs of cardiac vs. non-cardiac chest pain and understand that the etiology may not be clear based solely on the quality of pain. In specific patient populations, such as patients with diabetes, the presentation may be more inconspicuous. Understanding the patient's medical history and family history is critical to making the diagnosis. In the presence of cardiac risk factors, the clinician must have a high index of suspicion for a cardiac etiology and conduct further workup, versus when risk factors are absent.\nWhile the cardiologist is the team leader in the treatment and management of these patients, it is the primary care physician who usually completes the initial workup and makes the diagnosis in many cases. It is vital to obtain an accurate history and physical and have an open line of communication between physicians, or else the clinician may miss the diagnosis. A missed diagnosis increases morbidity and mortality for these patients as it may delay their treatment.\nAs the management of the condition progresses, cardiology nurses play an essential role in monitoring, assessing patient compliance with treatment regimens, and encouraging lifestyle changes. The pharmacist will weigh in on the patient's medication regimen by evaluating the effectiveness of chosen agents, checking for drug-drug interactions, and verifying dosing. With this type of interprofessional collaboration, patients with angina can experience increased quality of life and avoid future morbidity."
