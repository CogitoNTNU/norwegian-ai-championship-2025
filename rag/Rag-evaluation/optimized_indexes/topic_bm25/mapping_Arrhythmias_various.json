These classifications provide a structured approach to making clinical decisions.\n- Level A\n- High-quality evidence from multiple trials\n- Level B\n- Moderate-quality evidence from a single trial or non-randomized studies\n- Level C\n- Based on expert opinion or limited data from smaller studies\nThe 2019 ESC guidelines recommend an electrophysiology study for patients with recurrent symptomatic SVT when the arrhythmia mechanism is unclear, and for those with syncope suspected to be due to SVT when noninvasive testing is inconclusive (Class I and IIa recommendations).\nCatheter ablation is recommended for symptomatic SVT patients who desire definitive treatment or have not responded to medical therapy. This procedure is also indicated for those with severe symptoms, such as syncope (Class I). Additionally, catheter ablation should be considered for asymptomatic patients with preexcitation who have experienced arrhythmic syncope, rapid atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to electrical dyssynchrony (Class IIa).\nCatheter ablation may also be considered for patients with infrequent but severe episodes of SVT in whom medical therapy is not preferred or is contraindicated, as well as for those with asymptomatic preexcitation and low-risk accessory pathways (Class IIb). The benefits of catheter ablation include reduced hospitalizations and an improved quality of life."

The benefits of catheter ablation include reduced hospitalizations and an improved quality of life. Clinical Significance\n**Observations and Pacing Maneuvers During Sinus Rhythm**\nAnterograde conduction during sinus rhythm is assessed at baseline and during atrial pacing, with a focus on identifying ventricular preexcitation and dual AV node physiology. Ventricular preexcitation on a baseline electrocardiogram in a patient with narrow complex SVT suggests AVRT as the likely mechanism. However, preexcitation does not exclude other causes of narrow-complex tachycardia. **Atrial Pacing During Sinus Rhythm**\nAtrial pacing during sinus rhythm helps identify dual AV nodal physiology and the presence of ventricular preexcitation. During atrial extrastimuli pacing, an \u201catrium to His (A-H) jump\u201d is observed when a 10-millisecond decrease in the S1S2 coupling interval causes a greater than 50-millisecond increase in the A-H interval, which indicates the presence of dual AV nodal physiology. Additionally, decremental atrial pacing or atrial extrastimuli pacing can increase the degree of ventricular preexcitation or, in rare cases, uncover previously unrecognized ventricular preexcitation, especially from a left lateral accessory pathway. **Ventricular Pacing During Sinus Rhythm**\nVentricular pacing during sinus rhythm is a valuable tool for assessing the presence and location of concealed accessory pathways. This technique also aids in identifying nonseptal accessory pathways by revealing eccentric retrograde atrial activation patterns. When retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction is concentric\u2014meaning the earliest atrial activation occurs along the septum\u2014differential ventricular pacing can help identify a septal accessory pathway. This technique distinguishes retrograde conduction via the AV node from conduction through a septal accessory pathway, thereby differentiating nodal from extranodal responses. Differential ventricular pacing is performed from both the RV apex and the RV base."

    "text": "This technique distinguishes retrograde conduction via the AV node from conduction through a septal accessory pathway, thereby differentiating nodal from extranodal responses. Differential ventricular pacing is performed from both the RV apex and the RV base. The RV apex is located near the exit of the right bundle branch (RBB) fibers. In contrast, the RV base is closer to the typical insertion site of ventricular septal accessory pathways. During pacing, the stimulus-to-atrial (Stim-A or V-A) intervals are compared between the 2 pacing sites (see **Image. ** Differential Ventricular Pacing Responses). In cases where a septal accessory pathway is absent and ventricular activation conduction occurs exclusively through the AV node, pacing from the RV apex results in a shorter Stim-A or V-A interval than pacing from the RV base. This finding indicates retrograde conduction via the AV node only. Conversely, a shorter Stim-A (V-A) interval during pacing from the RV base compared to the RV apex suggests retrograde conduction through a septal accessory pathway or another extranodal pathway. **Observations and Pacing Maneuvers During SVT**\n**Observations During SVT**\nThe following observations can be seen during SVT:\n- Ventricular-to-atrial activation relationship\n- This refers to the ratio of ventricular to atrial activation electrograms during the tachycardia. The presence of A-V dissociation during the tachycardia excludes AVRT, which involves A-V bypass tracts. - Ventricular beats exceeding atrial beats\n- This finding excludes both atrial tachycardia and AVRT. In atrial tachycardia, the atria initiate and maintain the tachycardia, so the number of atrial activations should be equal to or greater than the ventricular activations. In AVRT, atrial and ventricular activations occur in a 1:1 ratio due to the reentrant circuit involving the AV node and 1 or more accessory pathways. - Atrial beats exceeding ventricular beats\n- When atrial beats outnumber ventricular beats, AVRT can be excluded. In AVRT, each atrial beat is usually followed by a ventricular beat. A higher number of atrial beats suggests an alternate mechanism, such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. - Ventricular activation interval (septal time)\n- This interval measures the time between ventricular activation and the subsequent atrial activation at the septum."

A higher number of atrial beats suggests an alternate mechanism, such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. - Ventricular activation interval (septal time)\n- This interval measures the time between ventricular activation and the subsequent atrial activation at the septum. A septal V-A interval shorter than 70 milliseconds suggests that the SVT is unlikely to be caused by AVRT involving typical bypass tracts, which generally produce longer V-A intervals. In these cases, AVNRT is more likely to occur. - Atrial activation sequence\n- This refers to the pattern of atrial activation during tachycardia. A concentric pattern begins at the AV node and spreads outward. In contrast, an eccentric pattern\u2014where the earliest activation occurs away from the septum\u2014suggests the presence of a concealed accessory pathway. **Observations During Transitions**\nThe following observations can be seen during transitions:\n- Initiation\n- How SVT begins can offer insights into its underlying mechanism. An A-H jump\u2014a sudden increase in the interval from atrial to His bundle activation\u2014indicates AV node involvement. This makes atrial tachycardia less likely, as it originates in the atria and does not depend on the AV node for its initiation. - Bundle branch block (BBB)\n- The presence of the BBB during tachycardia extends the ventricular activation interval in AVRT. Specifically, a prolongation of the ventricular activation interval of more than 35 milliseconds occurring alongside the appearance of BBB indicates orthodromic AVRT, especially when a free wall accessory pathway is ipsilateral to the BBB. - Termination\n- If the SVT terminates with an atrial event, it suggests atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia originates in the atria and is characterized by atrial impulses driving the tachycardia. Consequently, when atrial tachycardia terminates, it usually does so with an atrial event. - Conversely, AVNRT and AVRT may terminate with either an atrial or a ventricular event, depending on where the reentrant circuit is interrupted. If the circuit is interrupted on the ventricular side (for example, due to a change in ventricular conduction), the tachycardia may cease with a ventricular event. Alternatively, if the circuit is interrupted at the atrial level, termination may occur with an atrial event."

Alternatively, if the circuit is interrupted at the atrial level, termination may occur with an atrial event. The key distinction is that these forms of SVT are not solely dependent on atrial activity, allowing for termination through either atrial or ventricular event. - The term \"wobble\" in the context of tachycardia refers to spontaneous variations in the tachycardia cycle length (TCL). These fluctuations often result from variations in conduction velocity along different pathways that participate in the tachycardia circuit. In AVNRT, a wobble in the R-R interval suggests the presence of a \"slow pathway\" within the AV node. This finding also helps exclude atrial tachycardia, as atrial tachycardia typically causes variations in the A-A interval rather than the R-R interval. **Pacing Maneuvers During SVT**\nVentricular overdrive pacing (VOP) is a crucial technique for differentiating various types of SVT. To ensure accurate interpretation, specific conditions must be met during the maneuver, including:\n- Ventricular pacing is performed at a rate 10 to 30 milliseconds faster than the TCL, and it must be confirmed that the atrial rate advances to match the ventricular pacing rate. - The same tachycardia should continue after pacing stops. - No significant fluctuations, or \u201cwobbles,\u201d in the TCL should be present during pacing. When these criteria are fulfilled, the maneuver\u2019s results can be interpreted based on 2 key features, described below:\n- **Cessation response**\n- After the conclusion of ventricular overdrive pacing (VOP), the final atrial beat that has been advanced to the pacing cycle length is identified and represents the initial \u201cA\u201d in the cessation response. The pattern of this response helps distinguish the type of supraventricular tachycardia, as mentioned below. - In AVNRT and AVRT, an A-(H)-V response is observed. - In atrial tachycardia (AT), an A-A-(H)-V response is observed. - This response reflects the underlying mechanism of tachycardia. In both AVNRT and AVRT, atrial activation during ventricular pacing occurs via the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit, leaving the anterograde limb available for conduction."

In both AVNRT and AVRT, atrial activation during ventricular pacing occurs via the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit, leaving the anterograde limb available for conduction. As a result, the last retrograde atrial beat (A) from the final ventricular (V) pacing stimulus triggers the subsequent His bundle (H) and ventricular (V) activation, producing the characteristic A\u2013H\u2013V response. - On the other hand, during atrial tachycardia, ventricular pacing renders the AV conduction pathway immediately refractory, so the last retrograde atrial (A) beat from the final ventricular pacing stimulus is not conducted to the ventricle. Therefore, when overdrive pacing stops, the first beat of the atrial tachycardia initiates AV conduction, resulting in an A\u2013A\u2013H\u2013V response (see **Image. ** Ventricular Overdrive Pacing Responses in Atrial Tachycardia). - **Quantification in arrhythmia diagnosis**\n- Additional measurements are essential to differentiate between the mechanisms underlying an A-(H)-V response seen in AVNRT or AVRT. Specifically, the difference between the PPI and the TCL (referred to as PPI\u2212TCL) can provide valuable insight. - The PPI is measured from the last ventricular pacing stimulus to the return of the next ventricular beat at the same site. Generally, the closer the tachycardia circuit is to the ventricular pacing site, the smaller the PPI\u2212TCL value will be. To distinguish between orthodromic AVRT and AVNRT, a value of less than 115 milliseconds indicates a higher likelihood of AVRT. - AVRT is also likely when the corrected PPI\u2212TCL is under 110 milliseconds; the corrected PPI accounts for the difference between the A-H interval of the last paced beat and the tachycardia A-H interval (\u0394AH is subtracted from the PPI). In AVRT, the PPI tends to be shorter due to ventricular involvement in the reentrant circuit. - Notably, quantification criteria for VOP are most predictive when pacing occurs closest to the accessory pathway, for example, at the base of the RV, allowing for significant interval differences. Although a PPI\u2212TCL value less than 115 milliseconds (or a corrected PPI\u2212TCL value less than 110 milliseconds) supports the diagnosis of AVRT, a higher value does not exclude it."

This situation can occur in orthodromic AVRT cases where the accessory pathway is located far from the pacing site, such as with left-sided pathways. In these situations, pacing closer to the lateral pathway\u2014either from the LV or a ventricular branch of the coronary sinus\u2014can provide more definitive information. - An additional useful measurement for diagnosing orthodromic AVRT involving a septal pathway is the difference between the V-A interval during ventricular pacing (Stim-A interval) and the corresponding ventricular activation interval during tachycardia, known as \u0394VA. A \u0394VA value less than 85 milliseconds further supports the diagnosis of AVRT. **His-Synchronous or His-Refractory Premature Ventricular Contraction During SVT**\nWhen VOP is not feasible or diagnostic, a His-refractory premature ventricular contraction (HR-PVC) can provide additional information during tachycardia. This procedure involves delivering a ventricular extrastimulus, a PVC, timed to coincide with His bundle refractoriness, either exactly at the time of His recording or within 35 to 55 milliseconds after His depolarization. Confirmation of His refractoriness is achieved by analyzing the surface QRS, which will show a fused beat, representing fusion between a fully paced QRS morphology and the QRS morphology seen during SVT. As a result, any ventriculoatrial conduction occurring after the HR-PVC cannot be mediated through the His-Purkinje system, suggesting the presence of an accessory pathway if the timing of the subsequent atrial beat following the HR-PVC is affected. Three scenarios can arise if the timing of the immediate atrial beat is altered, as mentioned below:\n- Advancement of the subsequent atrial activation\n- An atrial activation that occurs earlier than expected following an HR-PVC strongly suggests the presence of an accessory pathway, as the only way the impulse can reach the atrium prematurely in this context is via an alternative route that bypasses the His bundle. However, this finding alone does not confirm the accessory pathway\u2019s involvement in the tachycardia."

If the atrial activation sequence remains consistent with that observed during tachycardia, it strongly supports\u2014but does not definitively prove\u2014the accessory pathway\u2019s participation in the tachycardia mechanism. - Delay of the subsequent atrial activation\n- A delay in atrial activation following an HR-PVC strongly suggests the presence of an accessory pathway and its participation in the tachycardia circuit. - Termination of the tachycardia without conduction to the atrium\n- Observing tachycardia termination without atrial conduction provides strong evidence for the presence and involvement of an accessory pathway. In this scenario, the His bundle is refractory and cannot conduct to the atrium, so the HR-PVC resets the rhythm only via the accessory pathway. However, in rare cases, an HR-PVC can delay or terminate AVNRT in the presence of a concealed nodoventricular or fasciculoventricular pathway. Here, the PVC blocks conduction through the His bundle but still reaches the ventricles via the accessory pathway, interrupting the reentrant circuit. This maneuver helps diagnose these concealed pathways. **Atrial Overdrive Pacing during S**VT\nAtrial overdrive pacing (AOP) can be performed during SVT to differentiate atrial tachycardia from AVNRT and to distinguish AVNRT from junctional tachycardia. This maneuver involves pacing the atrium at a cycle length 10 to 40 milliseconds shorter than the TCL. The criteria for successfully interpreting an AOP response are similar to those used for VOP, as outlined below:\n- Assessment of ventricular activation interval upon cessation of atrial overdrive pacing (ventricular activation linking) to differentiate atrial tachycardia from AVNRT/AVRT\n- When the first V-A interval immediately following the last atrial paced beat\u2014measured from at least 2 different atrial pacing sites (eg, right atrium, proximal coronary sinus, and distal coronary sinus)\u2014differs by 14 milliseconds or less, it supports a diagnosis of AVRT or AVNRT. Greater differences in ventricular activation intervals support a diagnosis of atrial tachycardia."

    "text": "Greater differences in ventricular activation intervals support a diagnosis of atrial tachycardia. - Assessment of the cessation response (AH-HA versus A-H-A) to differentiate AVNRT from junctional tachycardia\n- When AOP is stopped and tachycardia resumes, the electrogram displays distinct patterns depending on the type of tachycardia that has occurred. In junctional tachycardia, the response is an \"Atrial-His-His-Atrial\" (AH-HA) sequence (see **Image. ** Atrial Overdrive Pacing Response in Junctional Tachycardia). This occurs because the tachycardia resumes with a junctional beat initiated by a His signal immediately after pacing stops. In contrast, in AVNRT, cessation of AOP typically results in the tachycardia resuming with an atrial beat first, producing an \"atrial-His-atrial\" (A-H-A) sequence on the electrogram. - Response to atrial extrastimuli during tachycardia to differentiate AVNRT from junctional tachycardia\n- This maneuver is specifically used to distinguish between AVNRT and junctional tachycardia. An atrial extrastimulus, known as a premature atrial contraction (PAC), is delivered at various points during the TCL. Key observations are made based on the following 2 scenarios:\n- When the PAC is timed to coincide with the refractoriness of the His bundle (late PAC response)\n- When the PAC is timed before the His refractoriness (early PAC response)\nIf a late PAC affects the timing of the subsequent His depolarization, it strongly suggests the involvement of anterograde slow pathway conduction. This finding is typically associated with AVNRT. However, a negative response (ie, no change in His timing) is nondiagnostic. In contrast, if an early PAC advances the immediate His potential without terminating the tachycardia, it is a strong indicator of junctional tachycardia (see **Image. ** Response to Early Premature Atrial Contraction in Junctional Tachycardia vs Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia). This observation suggests that the tachycardia circuit does not depend on a retrograde fast pathway through the AV node, which is typically involved in AVNRT. Other responses, such as no change in the immediate His timing, followed by tachycardia termination, delay, or further advancement, are considered nondiagnostic."

However, the maneuver can be reattempted with some considerations. Each attempt should involve decremental pacing, decreasing the cycle length by 10 to 20 milliseconds after each attempt that demonstrates acceleration in atrial conduction. Additionally, it is essential to confirm that the TCL returns to approximately its original value after pacing is stopped. A pseudo-AAV response occurs when the response is mislabeled, such as selecting an \u201cA\u201d that precedes the actual last \u201cA.\u201d This situation can arise in long RP tachycardias or when isoproterenol increases junctional automaticity. To avoid this error, use calipers to measure the A-A interval and confirm it matches the pacing rate, while carefully identifying the last advanced \u201cA.\u201d Another scenario involves the A-H interval being shorter than the His to ventricle (H-V) interval, indicating that the impulse takes longer to conduct through the His-Purkinje system (ventricular conduction) than through the AV node. This may result from prolonged HV conduction due to conduction disease or a shortened A-H interval. This discrepancy can be addressed by comparing the AHV/AHV response with the AV/AAV response. A summary of electrophysiology laboratory maneuvers used to differentiate between types of SVT is presented in this paper (see **Table. ** Electrophysiology Lab Maneuvers for Differentiating Supraventricular Tachycardia)."

Healthcare professionals should immediately initiate guideline-directed management as per Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol. There is a lower likelihood of survival if the healthcare professional deviates from the ACLS guidelines. All patients with cardiac arrest should have an initial assessment while receiving quality CPR. Pulseless VT and VF are both shockable rhythm, and once the staff identifies the rhythm as VF, patients should be shocked immediately with 120 to 200 joules on a biphasic defibrillator or 360 joules using a monophasic. Patients receiving prompt defibrillation have shown improved survival (39.3%) compared to patients in whom defibrillation was delayed by 2 minutes or more (22.2%). Administer epinephrine and amiodarone as per ACLS protocol in patients sustaining VF rhythm regardless of receiving 3 shocks. Amiodarone significantly improves survival to hospital admission without affecting survival to hospital discharge. Identifying and addressing the cause of inciting event is equally important. Professionals should undertake cause-specific measures such as securing the airway, correcting electrolytes, administrating fluids, decompressing pneumothorax, draining tamponade while resuscitating the patient. Once the patient attains return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), physicians should begin a definitive evaluation for coronary artery disease. **Preventative Management**\nPrimary prevention has been a significant factor in reducing VF-related SCDs. Most VF transition from VT and other VA and hence identifying such arrhythmias at an early stage can help prevent VF. In patients with symptoms suspected to be related to VA, detection using ambulatory electrocardiography and implanted cardiac monitors is recommended. ."

Studies have continuously demonstrated the importance of Interprofessional communication and teamwork while resuscitating patients. Successful resuscitation is an outcome of good communication and understanding your responsibilities.

Post-resuscitation care brings further contributions from consultants such as a cardiologist, electrophysiologists, and neurologists.

In addition, the patient should be assessed for complications like aspiration, CPR related injuries, renal failure, and brain anoxic damage\nUnfortunately, mortality associated with VF/SCA remains high. Involving family in every step of management is pivotal as it helps in providing a holistic picture. Seeking help from chapel when deciding about goals of care can help the family make difficult decisions. Mild hypothermia has been shown to improve outcomes and should be considered. The patient needs to be seen by the neurologist to assess brain activity, dietitian to assess feeding, nephrologist as renal failure is common, and the pulmonologist to ensure that no aspiration has occurred during resuscitation. The entire team should communicate with each other to ensure that the patient is receiving the optimal standard of care.

It is good for patients with syncope. - Implantable loop recorder for patients with less frequent symptoms. **Tachyarrhythmia**\nTachyarrhythmia is defined as an abnormal rhythm with a ventricular heart rate of 100 beats per minute or more. It can be further classified based on the origin of the arrhythmia into:\nSupraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Arrhythmia originating from above the AV node (from atrial origin or AV junction origin). - Atrial fibrillation (AFib)\n- Atrial flutter\n- Atrial tachycardia\n- Atrial premature complex (PAC)\n- Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)\n- Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT)\n- AV junctional extrasystoles\nVentricular Tachycardia (VT): The origin of the arrhythmia is below the AV node."

Supraventricular tachycardia is further classified into atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia based on the mechanism of tachycardia. I. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT): As found in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (the presence of delta wave without arrhythmia doesn\u2019t require investigation or treatment). Mechanism: Accessory pathway present outside of the AV node-Bundle of Kent. It can be further categorized into:\n- Antidromic: Conduction down the accessory pathway and up to the AV node leading to the formation of a delta wave. - Orthodromic _:_ Conduction down the AV node into an accessory pathway with no delta wave. Signs & Symptoms: Palpitation, shortness of breath, or syncope. EKG Findings: Slurred upstroke of the QRS, delta wave, may give an impression of the wide QRS complex. Management: Amiodarone or procainamide. If this fails, the next step is synchronized cardioversion. Definitive Therapy: Ablation of the accessory pathway. II. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT)\nMechanism: Slow & fast fibers present in AV node & peri-nodal tissue leading to re-entry. Signs & Symptoms: Sudden tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or syncope. EKG Findings: Narrow complex tachycardia with P waves hidden in T waves. Heart rate is in the range of 150-160 bpm."

Heart rate is in the range of 150-160 bpm. Management:\nStep 1: Carotid massage/Valsalva maneuver\nStep 2: Adenosine\nStep 3: Cardioversion\nStep 4: Ablation or chronic suppressive therapy with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem/verapamil. III. Atrial fibrillation: It is the most common arrhythmia in the United States. It affects more than 20% of the general population at some time in their lives. There are five types based on their duration:\n- New-onset\n- Paroxysmal: Self-terminating or intermittent\n- Persistent: Fails to self-terminate within 7 days and requires treatments (medical or electrical cardioversion)\n- Long-standing Persistent: Lasts for \u2265 1 year\n- Permanent: Persistent for \u2265 1 year despite treatment\nMechanism: Multiple reentrant wavelets due to atrial ectopy from muscle fibers near the proximal part of the pulmonary vein. Signs & Symptoms: It can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms like palpitation, shortness of breath, irregularly irregular pulse, or even hypotension. EKG Findings: Irregularly irregular narrow complex tachycardia with no discernable P-waves. Management: The management strategy for atrial fibrillation can be classified into rate control or rhythm control. The decision to use a rate control or a rhythm-control strategy depends on the hemodynamic stability, candidacy for ablation, and the presence of co-morbidities. Patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of ischemic-embolic stroke, and anticoagulation recommendations are based on the CHA2DS2VaSc score. The CHA2DS2VaSc score is determined by the presence of the following factors: Congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) less than 40%, hypertension, age > 65 years, diabetes mellitus, history of stroke (non-hemorrhagic), or transient ischemic attack (TIA), vascular disease (peripheral vascular disease - PVD), age > 75 years, female sex. Each factor adds a point to the score, except for a history of stroke/TIA, which adds 2 points. - If the score is 0: No anticoagulation or aspirin based on individual assessment\n- If the score is 1: Aspirin or anticoagulation based on individual assessment."

Rate Control Strategy: The heart rate goal is < 110 bpm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. It can be achieved with either beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Digoxin is usually used as adjuvant therapy in a patient with a \"difficult to control\" heart rate or in heart failure patients. Cardioversion Strategy: Cardioversion is preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients or if rate control fails. It is also preferred in a young patient with no other co-morbidities. Cardioversion can be performed within 36 hrs of the onset of atrial fibrillation, but if the presentation is delayed or is of unknown duration, the absence of thrombi needs to be confirmed with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). If a thrombus is present on an echocardiogram, the patient will need anticoagulation for at least three weeks before cardioversion can be performed. The patient needs to be on anticoagulation for at least four weeks post cardioversion. Various modalities are available for cardioversion therapy and include synchronized electric cardioversion or chemical cardioversion with medications including flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, or dronedarone. Maze procedure is usually reserved for the patient undergoing other cardiac surgery. - Atrial Flutter\nMechanism: Reentrant circuit usually around the tricuspid annulus in the right atrium. Signs & Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic, or it can cause palpitation, shortness of breath, or hypotension. EKG Findings: Regular tachycardia with Saw-tooth appearance of P wave with a variable degree of AV block. Management: General goals include control of ventricular rate with AV blocking agents (beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers), but the restoration of sinus rhythm through cardioversion or ablation is preferred. - Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)\nMechanism: multiple automatic atrial foci due to increased sympathetic tone secondary to various causes, including hypoxemia (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or stimulant use. Signs & Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic."

Signs & Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. Patients will have symptoms of the underlying illness, such as dyspnea. EKG Findings: Three or more P wave morphologies with different PR intervals. Management: Oxygen therapy if hypoxemic and treatment of the underlying cause. Refractory cases: Rate Control with calcium channel blockers as the first choice in the setting of COPD followed by beta-blockers. - Junctional tachycardia: Arrhythmia originating from or near the AV node. Mechanism: Rhythm arising from the AV node. Risk Factors: Post cardiac surgery, myocardial ischemia (or during reperfusion), or digoxin toxicity. Signs & Symptoms: Usually well-tolerated and asymptomatic. EKG Findings: Inverted P Wave in the lead 2 with short PR or No P waves with a narrow complex. Management: Treat the underlying cause. IV. **Ventricular Tachycardia:** Origin is below the AV node. It is the major cause of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States. a) Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: When the rapid ventricular rhythm terminates on its own within 30 seconds. Mechanism: Channelopathies secondary to structural abnormality, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic imbalance, and the effect of pro-arrhythmic drugs. Risk Factors: Structural or ischemic heart disease. Signs & Symptoms: Asymptomatic or palpitations. EKG Findings: Monomorphic wide complex with more than three beats in a row but lasts less than three seconds. Management: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and/or medical therapy. b) Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia\nMechanism: Presence of damaged fibers in ischemic heart disease leading to re-entry of current. Some patients do not have structural heart disease. Approximately 10% of the cases are idiopathic. Risk Factors: Structural heart disease and post-myocardial infarction. Signs & Symptoms: Palpitation, hypotension, or syncope. EKG Findings: Monomorphic wide complex tachycardia. Management: Intravenous lidocaine, amiodarone, or procainamide. Catheter ablation is an option too. c) Ventricular Fibrillation\nMechanism: Presence of damaged fibers in ischemic heart disease leading to re-entry of current leading to disorganized high-frequency excitation."

Risk Factors: Structural heart disease and post-myocardial infarction. Signs & Symptoms: Syncope and death if not treated immediately. EKG Findings: Polymorphic fibrillatory waves. Management: Unsynchronized cardioversion followed by amiodarone. d) Torsades De Pointes:\nMechanism: It is usually precipitated by premature ventricular contraction leading to the \u201cR on T phenomenon.\u201d\nRisk Factors: Congenital long QTc with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Signs & Symptoms: Syncope and death if not treated immediately. EKG Findings: Polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia with a heart rate > 300 bpm. Management: Intravenous magnesium or Isoproterenol, which increases heart rate and decreases QT-duration. Avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Chronic therapy with beta-blockers in patients with long QT syndrome. **Bradyarrhythmias:**   Bradyarrhythmia is defined as a heart rate below 60 beats per minute (bpm) and comprises several rhythm disorders, including atrioventricular (A-V) blocks and sinus node disorders. Sinus Bradycardia\nMechanism: Increased vagal tone. It can be physiological in athletes. Signs & Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. It can lead to orthostasis or dizziness if pathological. EKG Findings: Sinus rhythm with an upright P wave in lead II and biphasic in V1. Management: No treatment is required unless pathological with an inadequate heart rate increase with leg raise test. Treat with isoproterenol or pacemaker if no relief. Atrioventricular Blocks\nMechanism: Atrial impulses are conducted with a delay or not at all when an electrical impulse reaches a tissue that not excitable or is in a refractory period. a) First Degree AV Block: Caused by increased vagal tone or conduction impairment or due to medications. Signs & Symptoms: Generally asymptomatic but can cause dizziness. EKG Findings: PR interval is greater than 200 milliseconds. Management: Usually, no need to treat."

Sign & Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, syncope. EKG Findings: Mobitz type I shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex or dropped beat. Mobitz type II has randomly dropped QRS complexes.

Sign & Symptoms: Profound bradycardia, hypotension, and can lead to asystole and cardiac arrest. EKG Findings: Bradycardia, P waves occur independently of QRS and Wide QRS for ventricular rhythm. Management: Pacemaker placement. **Sinus Node Dysfunction**\nMechanism: Senescence of the SA node, an ischemic event involving the SA node leading to impulse generation at a slower rate. a) Sinus Pause: When the SA node has delayed impulse generation. b) Sinus Arrest: Failure of impulse generation. c) SA Nodal Exit Block: Failure of impulse transmission. Sign & Symptoms: Bradycardia, dizziness, palpitation, or syncope. EKG Findings: P wave not originating at a determined rate with regularity\nManagement: Symptomatic patients require pacemaker placement."

Other Issues\n**Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy**\nMechanism: Subaortic outflow tract obstruction from abnormal hypertrophy of the septal region of the heart, leading to precipitation of ventricular arrhythmias.\nRisk Factor: Autosomal dominant mutation in the gene coding for cardiac sarcomere(Beta myosin heavy chain). Suspect this in a patient with a family history of sudden cardiac death in 2 first-degree relatives.\nSymptoms: Syncope with exertion, palpitation, develops early heart failure symptoms.\nTreatment: Beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy. Surgery is indicated for patients with obstructive physiology with an outflow gradient greater than 50 mmHg. The defibrillator is indicated for patients who are symptomatic post maximal medical therapy, abnormal systolic blood pressure response to exercise, septal thickness > 30 mm, runs of ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation on telemetry or during the stress test.\nIndications for ICD placements to prevent sudden cardiac death with arrhythmia:\n- CHF with EF < 35% after three months of maximal medical therapy.\n- Myocardial infarction (MI) with EF < 40% with inducible VT or VF in electrophysiological studies.\n- MI with EF < 30%\n- Patients with long QT if QTc > 500 and an episode of unexplained syncope or Holter showing NSVTs"

The patient presentation can be varied even for the same arrhythmia and can require a different management approach based on the patient's clinical condition and characteristics. While clinical history, physical exam, and EKG findings may reveal particular kinds of arrhythmia, it can sometimes be challenging to form an appropriate management plan without an expert opinion. While an internist is always involved in the care of patients with arrhythmia, it is essential to consult an interprofessional team of specialists, including cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and interventionists.\nBased on the condition, the patient may need further evaluation with electrophysiological or ischemia workup for the cause of arrhythmia, which will eventually be treated by a cardiac catheterization or ablation procedure. The nurses are vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs, telemetry, and assist with the patient and family's education. It has been shown that hospitals with a dedicated arrhythmia team consisting of a nurse, electrophysiologist, noninvasive arrhythmia expert, and internist have shown significant improvement in the outcomes of patients."
