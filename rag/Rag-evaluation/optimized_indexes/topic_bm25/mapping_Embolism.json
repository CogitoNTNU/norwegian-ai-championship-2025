    "text": "Introduction\nFat embolism and fat embolism syndrome (FES) are clinical phenomena characterized by the systemic dissemination of fat emboli within the systemic circulation. The dissipation of fat emboli disrupts the capillary bed and affects microcirculation, causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. End-organ manifestation typically involves the skin, the central nervous system, the lungs, and the retina. FES is most common in patients with orthopedic trauma. It also can occur in nontraumatic conditions such as acute or chronic pancreatitis, bone marrow transplant, or liposuction.\nIn most instances, diagnosis is usually established during the autopsy. Fat embolism is the presence of fat globules in microcirculation, whereas FES is a systemic manifestation of the dissemination of fat molecules or globules in microcirculation. FES is a continuum of fat embolism. Zenker first described the clinical presentation of FES in 1863 in a patient suffering from a crush injury. In 1873, Von Bergmann clinically diagnosed the condition for the first time. Since the initial description by Zenker and Von Bergmann, several articles and studies have been published on this disease entity. In the early 1970s, Gurd proposed a clinical criterion for diagnosing FES. This was later modified by Wilson in 1974 in conjunction with Gurd and is the most commonly used clinical criteria for diagnosis. Since the majority of reported cases of fat embolism are seen in patients with orthopedic trauma, most research on this condition is in orthopedic patients. Even though the clinical criteria proposed by Gurd et al and Wilson can help or aid in the diagnosis, FES still poses a major diagnostic challenge to most clinicians."

Etiology\n**Traumatic Causes**\nTraumatic causes of FES are more common than nontraumatic causes. Trauma as a cause of FES can occur from the fracture of the long bones, such as the femur and tibia, and also the pelvis. Operations such as pelvis or knee arthroplasty and intramedullary nailing and reaming can cause FES. The technique of inserting the intramedullary nails that can increase the likelihood of development of FES includes increased velocity in reaming, overzealousness in the nailing of the medullary cavity, and the widened gap between the nail and the cortex of the bone\nOther rare traumatic conditions that can cause FES include the following:\n- Massive soft tissue damage\n- Crush injury\n- Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n- Severe burn involving more than 50% of body surface area\n- Bone marrow transplantation\n- Liposuction\n- Median sternotomy\n**Nontraumatic Causes**\nCases of nontraumatic FES are very rare and include the following:\n- Fatty Liver\n- Acute or chronic pancreatitis\n- Therapy with corticosteroid\n- Infusion of fat emulsion\n- Lymphography\n- Hemoglobinopathies\n- Sickle cell disease\n- Thalassemia\nSeveral risk factors are associated with the development of FES.

The disruption affects the microcirculatory hemostasis in the brain, skin, eyes, and heart. Two main theories try to explain the development of FES: mechanical and biochemical. **Mechanical Theory**\nGassling et al postulated that large fat droplets are released into the venous system. Elevation of the intramedullary from trauma or surgery leads to the release of fat into the venous sinusoids. From the venous system, these fat globules are deposited in the pulmonary capillary bed, where they travel to the brain via the arteriovenous shunt into the brain. Initially, there was no valid explanation for the development of FES in patients with no patent foramen ovale, but the presence of an arteriovenous shunt clarifies this. Also, intravascular fat droplets are deformable, hence their ability to transverse the pulmonary vasculature. The pathophysiological changes produced by fat droplets include the following:\n- Elevated pulmonary artery pressure\n- Impairment of oxygen exchange from ventilation-perfusion mismatch\n- Systemic effects on end-organisms such as the brain, kidney, and skin. The deposition of fat droplets in the brain produces a cascade of reactions. Disruption of microcirculation leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, local inflammation, and ischemia. The release of inflammatory mediators and vasoactive amines like histamine and serotonin increases vascular permeability and vasodilation, with ensuing hypotension and hypoperfusion. **Biochemical Theory**\nBaker et al proposed this theory for the development of FES. According to this theory, the precipitating event, whether traumatic or nontraumatic, triggers a hormonal change in the body system. This leads to the release of free fatty acid (FFA) and chylomicrons."

Animal model studies included injecting Tirolean, a form of fat found in bone marrow, into the caudal veins of rats and monitoring changes in the lungs over an 11-day period. The subsequent histopathological examination of the lung tissues included staining for the smooth muscle's fat, collagen, and actin. The most notable change was a decrease in the patency of the arteries and arterioles over the first 96 hours. Still, there was a return to normal patency towards the end of the observation period, the 11th day. There was also significant inflammation and fibrosis around the blood vessels. These changes were noticeable within the first couple of hours of infusion and persisted for the time frame for which the study was conducted.

Fat embolism and FES are multiorgan diseases that can damage the kidneys, heart, skin, brain, and lungs. Fat embolism typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult. **History**\nThe history should elicit the time and onset of symptoms. Also, since most cases of fat embolism and FES are related to orthopedic trauma, the time and mechanism of the trauma and intraoperative maneuvers should be noted in the history. Sickle cell disease and other forms of hemoglobinopathy can precipitate FES. Patients should be asked about the history of sickle cell disease in family members and any complications of sickle cell disease like acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises, or avascular necrosis of long bones. The history of drug ingestion or alcoholism that can trigger pancreatitis leading to FES should also be clarified. The symptoms of fat embolism and FES are nonspecific. Patients might complain of the following:\n- Pain related to bone fracture\n- Nausea\n- General weakness\n- Malaise\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Headache\n**Signs and Symptoms**\nThese include but are not limited to the following:\n_Respiratory_\n- Tachypnea\n- Tachycardia\n- Diaphoresis\n**_Central nervous system_**\n- Agitation from hypoxia\n- Restlessness\n- Change in mental status\n- Seizure\n- Coma\n_Skin_\nPetechial rash\n_Eye_\nRetinal hemorrhage\n**Physical Examination**\nThe examination of a patient with FES should be very thorough.

Evaluation\nDiagnosis of FES can be very challenging because the signs and symptoms can be vague. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria. Based on experience and research, several authors have proposed diagnostic criteria for FES. Gurd et al in 1970 and later Wilson in 1974 put forward the following diagnostic criteria: 2 major criteria or at least one major criteria and 4 minor criteria. **Major Criteria**\n- Petechial rash\n- Respiratory insufficiency\n- Cerebral involvement in non-head injury patients\n**Minor Criteria**\n- Fever greater than 38.5 C\n- Tachycardia heart rate greater than 110 beats per minute\n- Retinal involvement\n- Jaundice\n- Renal signs\n- Anemia\n- Thrombocytopenia\n- High erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n- Fat macroglobulinemia\n**Schoenfeld Criteria**\nAnother report by Schoenfeld et al proposed a quantitative means for diagnosing FES. A cumulative score greater than 5 is required for the diagnosis. - 5 points - petechiae rash\n- 4 points - diffuse infiltrate on x-ray\n- 3 points - hypoxemia\n- 1 point (for each) - fever, tachycardia, confusion\n**Lindeque Criteria**\nLastly, Lindegue et al suggested using respiratory symptoms alone as the diagnostic criteria for FES. This criterion has not gained worldwide acceptance compared to the Gurd, Wilson, and Schoenfeld criteria. - Sustained Pa02 less than 8 kilopascal\n- Sustained PC02 greater than 7.3 kilopascal\n- Sustained respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute despite sedation\n- Dyspnea, increased work of breathing, anxiety, tachycardia\n**Ancillary Studies**\nApart from the aforementioned diagnostic criteria, other ancillary studies are needed to aid in the diagnostic workup, including the following:\n_Complete blood count_\nAnemia and thrombocytopenia are very common in FES. _Comprehensive metabolic panel_\nMetabolic acidosis, increased levels of BUN, and creatinine can be seen in patients with FES. _Arterial blood gas_\nVentilation-perfusion mismatch is a hallmark of FES."

The arterial blood gas analysis usually has a low partial pressure of oxygen, causing hypoxemia. An increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient is common in FES. The A-a gradient is the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolus and the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. In FES, the pulmonary blood vessels are occluded, causing perfusion impairment with normal ventilation. The result of this in FES is a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. To calculate the A-a gradient, use the formula:\n**A-a gradient = PA02 - Pa02**\n- Pa02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery\n- PA02 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar sac\nTo calculate the PAO2 and Pa02\n- PAO2 = FiO2 (P atmospheric - P water vapor) \u2013 (PCO2/R). - PaO2 = partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. PaO2 in arterial blood gas can be used as follows. - FiO2 is the concentration of inspired oxygen expressed as a fraction. This is around 0.21 at room air. - P atmospheric is the barometric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level). - P water vapor is the water vapor pressure (48 mmHg at 37 C). - PaCO2 is the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide. If approximated, this is presumed to be equal to arterial PCO2. PACO2 is presumed to be equal to 40 mmHg\n- R is the respiratory quotient, equating to about 0.8 on a regular diet. The normal alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is as follows:\n- PA02 = alveolar partial pressure of O2 = FiO2 \u00d7 (patmospheric - P water vapor) - (PCO2/R). - 0.21 \u00d7 (760 - 48) - (40/0.8) = 150-50 = 100 mmHg\nThe normal partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood is between 75 to 100mmHg."

However, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch can significantly increase FES. **Bronchoalveolar Lavage**\nBronchoalveolar lavage has been extensively researched as a diagnostic tool for FES. Lipid inclusion in the macrophages might point to a diagnosis of FES but is not specific, as this can be seen in other clinical conditions. Moreover, the procedure is time-consuming and invasive and might not give the best diagnostic yield. Attempts at developing biological markers for FES have been disappointing because of low specificity. Lipase, free fatty acid, and phospholipase A2 have been demonstrated to be elevated in FES, but this also can be seen in other disease conditions of the lung\nBlood, urine, and sputum analysis might show the presence of fat globules.

Treatment / Management\n**Pharmacotherapy**\nThere is no specific treatment for fat embolism or FES. Based on experimental studies, an attempt was made to use dextrose infusion to decrease FFA mobilization. Ethanol also was used as an agent to inhibit lipolysis. In clinical practice, there were no proven benefits. Experimental use of heparin in an animal model was found to be beneficial but is no longer used in clinical practice because of the potential risk of bleeding. There has not been a proven clinical benefit with heparin in FES. Therapy with corticosteroids has been proposed for the treatment of FES based on the following effects:\n- Inhibition of complement-activated leucocyte aggregation\n- Limiting FFA level\n- Membrane stabilization\nA meta-analysis of 7 randomized control trials using corticosteroid prophylaxis showed a close to 77% reduction in the risk for FES in a patient with a long bone fracture. However, there is no difference in mortality, infection, or avascular necrosis between the treatment group and the control group. For this reason, the use of corticosteroids is still very controversial. **Inferior Vena Cava Filter**\nThis has been proposed as a measure to prevent the showering of fat emboli. However, placing an inferior vena cava filter has not been studied sufficiently as a prophylactic treatment for FES. **Operative Measures**\nIt is highly recommended that early open reduction and internal fixation of long bone fractures be started. The incidence of FES is higher in a patient with long bone fractures who are managed conservatively.

During operative fixation of the long bone fracture, care must be taken to limit the intramedullary pressure, as high pressure is associated with increased fat emboli entering the systemic circulation. Some techniques utilized in orthopedic surgery to reduce embolization include:\n- Lavage of bone marrow before fixation\n- Venting of the femoral bone\n- Drilling of small holes in the cortex of the bone to lower intramedullary pressure\nNone of these maneuvers has been shown to reduce FES. **Supportive Care**\nOnce a patient develops FES, this is the mainstay treatment. Supportive care is geared toward adequately oxygenating the end organs. **Goals of Supportive Care**\n- Provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation\n- Maintenance of adequate hemodynamic stability\n- Transfusion of packed red blood cells to improve oxygen delivery if indicated\n- Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis with a sequential compression device\n- Adequate nutrition and hydration\nSupplemental oxygen might be required, and if the patient develops fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome, intubation, and mechanical ventilation might be required. **Albumin**\nAlbumin is recommended as part of the resuscitation tools for hypovolemia.

Introduction\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot that has arisen from a different area obstructs the pulmonary arteries. Most commonly, PE originates from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. PE usually occurs when a part of this thrombus breaks off and enters the pulmonary circulation. PE rarely occurs from embolizing other materials into the pulmonary circulation, eg, air, fat, or tumor cells. Together, PE and DVT comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factors for PE include genetic predispositions like thrombophilia and acquired conditions, including prolonged immobility, surgery, and malignancy.\nDespite advancements in diagnostic tools and treatment options, the nonspecific symptoms of PE (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope) often overlap with other cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, making timely diagnosis challenging for clinicians. Prompt recognition and management of PE are critical, as delayed intervention can lead to severe complications, including hemodynamic instability, right ventricular failure, and sudden death. Risk stratification tools such as the Wells criteria and Geneva score, alongside diagnostic imaging, are essential for accurate diagnosis. However, the underutilization of these tools, coupled with variations in therapeutic approaches, underscores the need for standardized clinical protocols. Clinicians can improve patient outcomes through enhanced knowledge and proficiency in identifying risk factors, employing diagnostic strategies, and initiating evidence-based treatments."

Clinicians can improve patient outcomes through enhanced knowledge and proficiency in identifying risk factors, employing diagnostic strategies, and initiating evidence-based treatments. Etiology\n**Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism**\nMost PEs originate as lower extremity DVTs. Hence, PE risk factors are the same as DVT. The Virchow triad of hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and endothelial injury provides an understanding of these risk factors. Risk factors can be classified as genetic and acquired. Genetic risk factors include thrombophilia, eg, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Acquired risk factors include immobilization for prolonged periods (eg, bed rest of longer than 3 days, any type of travel for >4 hours), recent orthopedic surgery, malignancy, indwelling venous catheter, obesity, pregnancy, cigarette smoking, and oral contraceptive pill use. Smoking is a risk factor for all causes of pulmonary infarction, including those associated with PE. Paradoxically, younger age (peaking at 40) and increased height are associated with an increased likelihood of developing a PE complicated by pulmonary infarction, while obesity is associated with a reduced likelihood. Other predisposing factors for VTE include:\n- Fracture of lower limb\n- Hospitalization for heart failure or atrial fibrillation/flutter within the previous 3 months\n- Hip or knee replacement\n- Major trauma\n- History of previous venous thromboembolism\n- Central venous lines\n- Chemotherapy\n- Congestive heart failure or respiratory failure\n- Hormone replacement therapy\n- Oral contraceptive therapy\n- Postpartum period\n- Infection (specifically pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and HIV)\n- Cancer (highest risk in metastatic disease)\n- Thrombophilia\n- Bed rest longer than 3 days\n- Obesity\n- Pregnancy\nCancer carries a high risk for thrombus formation and, hence, PE. Pancreatic cancer, hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk for VTE."

Pathophysiology\nPE occurs when a blot clot enters the pulmonary circulation. Multiple emboli are typically involved within the lower lung lobes more frequently than the upper lobes; bilateral lung involvement is also more common. Large emboli tend to obstruct the main pulmonary artery, causing saddle embolus with deleterious cardiovascular consequences. In contrast, smaller-sized emboli block the peripheral arteries and can lead to pulmonary infarction, manifested by intra-alveolar hemorrhage. PE leads to impaired gas exchange due to obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed, leading to a mismatch in the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio because alveolar ventilation remains the same. Still, pulmonary capillary blood flow decreases, leading to dead space ventilation and hypoxemia. Also, mediators, eg, serotonin, are released, which cause vasospasm and further decrease pulmonary flow in unaffected lung areas. Local accumulation of inflammatory mediators alters lung surfactant and stimulates respiratory drive, resulting in hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. In PE, pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to the mechanical obstruction of the vascular bed with thrombus and hypoxic vasoconstriction. Pulmonary artery pressure increases if thromboembolic occlusion is >30% to 50% of the total cross-sectional area of the pulmonary arterial bed. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance increases the right ventricular afterload, which impedes right ventricular outflow and causes right ventricular dilation and flattening or bowing of the interventricular septum. Developing the right bundle branch block may increase the desynchronization of the ventricles. The decreased right ventricular outflow and concomitant right ventricular dilation reduce left ventricular filling, compromising cardiac output. As a result, left ventricular filling is reduced in early diastole, reducing cardiac output and causing systemic hypotension and hemodynamic instability. Right ventricle failure due to acute pressure overload is the primary cause of death in severe PE."

Right ventricle failure due to acute pressure overload is the primary cause of death in severe PE. Given the above pathophysiological considerations, clinical symptoms and signs of overt right ventricular failure and hemodynamic instability indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30-day) mortality. Additionally, the early literature suggested that patients with underlying cardiac disease were at the greatest risk for developing a pulmonary infarction associated with acute PE, as poor collateral circulation, in combination with pulmonary thromboembolism, was thought to result in infarction. However, recent studies suggest the opposite. Specifically, younger patients without cardiopulmonary disease were found to be more likely to suffer a pulmonary infarction secondary to PE. Experts hypothesize that longstanding local tissue hypoxia from chronic cardiopulmonary disease states leads to more robust bronchial vascular collateralization, protecting parenchyma from infarction. The lung parenchyma receives its oxygen supply from 3 nonredundant sources: deoxygenated blood from pulmonary arteries, oxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation, and direct oxygen diffusion from alveoli. A sufficient impedance from one of these sources can cause infarction and subsequent tissue necrosis. Inflammatory mediators from ischemic parenchyma can further limit gas exchange following the resultant vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction. When ischemia of lung tissue is not reversed promptly, infarction ensues. A unilateral infarct occurs in 77% to 87% of pulmonary infarctions, with the strongest predilection for the right lower lobe. Multiple studies show a stark predominance of pulmonary infarction in the lower lobes relative to the upper lobes, thought to be due to gravity\u2019s influence on the unique relationship between alveolar, pulmonary, and bronchial arterial pressure."

History and Physical\n**Clinical History**\nA timely diagnosis of PE is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Notably, 30% of untreated patients with PEs die, while only 8% die after timely therapy. Unfortunately, diagnosing PE can be difficult due to the variety of nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms in patients with acute PE. The most common symptoms of PE include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, presyncope, and syncope. Dyspnea may be acute and severe in a central PE, whereas mild and transient dyspnea is observed in small peripheral PE. In patients with preexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnea may be the only symptom. Chest pain is a frequent symptom usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal emboli causing pulmonary infarction. In central PE, chest pain may be from underlying right ventricular ischemia and needs to be differentiated from an acute coronary syndrome or aortic dissection. Less common presentations include arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), syncope, and hemodynamic collapse. Hemodynamic instability is a rare but essential form of clinical presentation, as it indicates central or extensive PE with severely reduced hemodynamic reserve. Syncope may occur and may be associated with a higher prevalence of hemodynamic instability and right ventricular dysfunction. Recognizing that patients with large PE may sometimes be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms is crucial. PE may often be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally during diagnostic workup for another disease. Therefore, in addition to PE symptoms, clinicians should look for VTE risk factors to determine the clinical probability of PE. **Physical Examination Findings**\nOn examination, patients with PE might have tachypnea and tachycardia, which are common but nonspecific findings."

Evaluation\n**Diagnostic Evaluation of Acute Pulmonary Embolus**\nThe diagnosis of an acute PE comprises various laboratory and imaging studies in conjunction with clinical probability scoring systems, such as the Wells and Geneva criteria. **Arterial blood gas analysis**\nUnexplained hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph should raise clinical suspicion for PE. Widened alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen, respiratory alkalosis, and hypocapnia are common findings on arterial blood gas (ABG) as a pathophysiological response to PE. Notably, respiratory or lactic acidosis is uncommon but can be present in patients with massive PE associated with obstructive shock and respiratory arrest. **Brain natriuretic peptide**\nElevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has limited diagnostic importance in patients suspected of having PE. Right ventricular pressure overload because of acute PE is associated with more myocardial stretch, releasing BNP and N-terminal-proBNP. Thus, the levels of natriuretic peptides in blood reflect the severity of right ventricular dysfunction in acute PE. **Troponin**\nSerum troponin I is beneficial prognostically but not diagnostically. As a marker of right ventricular dysfunction, troponin levels are elevated in 30% to 50% of patients with moderate to large PE and are linked to clinical deterioration and death after PE. **D-dimer**\nD-dimer levels are elevated in plasma whenever an acute thrombotic process occurs in the body because the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways are activated simultaneously. D-dimer testing has a high negative predictive value; hence, a normal D-dimer level makes acute PE or DVT unlikely. However, since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not used to confirm PE."

However, since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not used to confirm PE. As many D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their clinical setting. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a diagnostic sensitivity of at least 95%. ELISA can exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with either low or intermediate pretest probability. A negative ELISA D-dimer and low clinical probability can exclude PE in approximately 30% of suspected patients without further testing. The specificity of D-dimer decreases steadily with age to approximately 10% in patients older than 80. Using age-adjusted cut-offs for patients older than 50 may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in older adults. In one study, using the age-adjusted cut-off instead of the standard D-dimer cut-off of 500 ng/mL or more increased the number of patients in whom the possibility of PE could be ruled out from 6.4% to 30%, without additional false-negative findings. The formula is age (years) x 10 ng/mL for patients older than 50. For example, patient age 75 = age-adjusted d-dimer of 750 ng/mL. **Electrocardiography**\nElectrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities in patients with suspected PE are nonspecific. The most common ECG findings in PE are tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment, T-wave changes, S1Q3T3 pattern, right ventricular strain, and new incomplete right bundle branch block, which are uncommon (see **Image**. Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism). **Chest radiograph**\nIn PE, a chest radiograph (CXR) is usually normal or might show nonspecific abnormalities such as atelectasis or effusion. It helps to rule out alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. CXR image may be the first clue toward diagnosing pulmonary infarction (see **Image. ** Wedge-Shaped Pulmonary Infarction). A \"Hampton hump\" (wedge-shaped consolidation at the lung periphery), Westermark sign (radiographic oligemia or increased lucency), and Fleischer sign (prominent pulmonary artery) are specific findings but lack sensitivity to be diagnostically sufficient. A sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82%, respectively, with Hampton hump, have been quoted in the literature (see **Image."

A sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82%, respectively, with Hampton hump, have been quoted in the literature (see **Image. ** Hampton Hump). Other features, such as atelectasis or focal consolidation, may be present but are neither sensitive nor specific. The Westermark sign is the sharp cut-off of pulmonary vessels with distal hypoperfusion in a segmental distribution within the lung; these findings are rare but specific to acute PE. Westermark sign may be seen in up to 2% of the cases, resulting from a combination of dilation of the pulmonary artery proximal to the thrombus and the collapse of the distal vasculature. **Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA)**\nMultidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the diagnostic modality of choice for patients with suspected PE. CTPA allows appropriate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The PIOPED (Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis) II study showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for CTPA in PE diagnosis. Moreover, CTPA is the most commonly used imaging technique to diagnose pulmonary infarction in combination with appropriate clinical context (see **Image. ** Pulmonary Embolism). CT findings associated with pulmonary infarction include a feeding vessel or \"vessel sign,\" central lucency, and a semicircular shape. The finding of air bronchograms made a pulmonary infarction less likely. If a vessel sign with a central lucency and no air bronchogram is present on CT, the specificity for detecting pulmonary infarction is 99%. PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pretest clinical probability on the predictive value of CTPA. A normal CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE at 96% and 89% in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability, respectively, but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pretest probability was high. Contrarily, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92% to 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pretest likelihood of PE."

Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgment and the CTPA result. The present data suggest that a negative CTPA result is adequate for excluding PE in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability. Whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated remains controversial. CTPA may be relatively contraindicated in moderate to severe iodinated contrast allergy or renal insufficiency (eGFR \\<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The risk of these contraindications must be measured against the clinical significance of performing the CTPA examination and the availability of other imaging modalities, eg, ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan). If clinically feasible, CTPA should be postponed for premedication for a history of allergy or IV hydration for renal insufficiency. CTPA can detect right ventricular enlargement and other indicators of right ventricular dysfunction. Enlarged right ventricular has predictive value, supported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study in 457 patients. In that study, right ventricular enlargement (right ventricular/left ventricular ratio \u22650.9) was a strong and independent predictor of a severe in-hospital outcome in the overall population and hemodynamically stable patients. **Lung scintigraphy**\nThe planar V/Q scan is an established diagnostic test for suspected PE, mainly performed for patients in whom CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive or when additional testing is needed. A normal chest radiograph is usually required before V/Q scanning. Scans performed on patients with abnormal chest radiographs are likely false positives because the images do not appear normal or a low probability of PE in such patients is present. V/Q scanning remains the test of choice for diagnosing PE in pregnancy for those with a normal chest radiograph. Other patients include those with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and those with severe renal failure."

Other patients include those with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and those with severe renal failure. Planar lung scan results are frequently classified into 3 tiers: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and nondiagnostic scan. Multiple studies have suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. An analysis from the PIOPED II study advocated that a high-probability V/Q scan can confirm PE. However, the positive predictive value of a high-probability V/Q scan is not enough to confirm the PE diagnosis in patients with a low clinical probability. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they require further diagnostic testing. **Pulmonary angiography**\nIn pulmonary angiography, contrast is injected via a catheter introduced into the right heart under fluoroscopy, which was the gold standard in the past for diagnosing PE. The diagnosis of acute PE is made on the evidence of a thrombus, either as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch or a filling defect. With the widespread emergence of CTPA, pulmonary angiography is infrequently used and reserved for rare circumstances for patients with a high clinical probability of PE, in whom CTPA or V/Q scanning is nondiagnostic. Pulmonary angiography seems inferior to CTPA; the results are operator-dependent and highly variable. Therefore, catheter-based pulmonary angiography is performed in patients who need therapeutic benefit since it helps with diagnosis and therapeutic interventions aimed at clot lysis. **Magnetic resonance angiography**\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) regarding suspected PE has been assessed for several years. However, large-scale studies show that this promising technique is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE due to its low sensitivity, low availability in most emergency settings, and the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans. However, clinicians may consider this imaging option to evaluate PE in patients in whom neither CTPA nor V/Q scan can be performed. Potential advantages include no exposure to radiation. MR pulmonary angiography was studied prospectively in 371 adults with suspected PE."

Among the 48% of patients with technically adequate images, MR pulmonary angiography and MR pulmonary venography have shown a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. **Echocardiography**\nTransthoracic echocardiography can rarely definitively diagnose PE when the thrombus is visualized in the proximal pulmonary arteries. The diagnosis of PE on echocardiography is supported by the presence of a clot in the right heart or new right heart strain, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected PE. An echocardiogram may be helpful to establish a possible diagnosis and justify the emergency use of thrombolytic therapy (see **Image. ** Transesophageal Echocardiography, Pulmonary Embolism). Significant considerations are apparent when using echocardiography to establish a diagnosis of PE. Given the right ventricular's peculiar shape, no single echocardiographic parameter gives quick and accurate right ventricular size or function information. That is why echocardiographic criteria for diagnosing PE have varied between different studies. Because of the negative predictive value of 40% to 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. On the other hand, signs of right ventricular overload or dysfunction may also be present without acute PE and may be due to coexisting cardiac or respiratory disease. Right ventricular dilation is seen in \u226525% of patients with PE on echo and is helpful for risk stratification of the disease. More specific echocardiography findings confer a high positive predictive value for PE with preexisting cardiorespiratory illness. This includes the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the right ventricular outflow tract) \\<60 milliseconds with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient less than 60 mm Hg ('60/60' sign) or McConnell sign (with depressed contractility of the right ventricular free wall compared to the right ventricular apex), is suggestive of PE."

Treatment / Management\n**Initial Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolus**\n**Supportive measures**\nThe initial approach to patients with PE should focus on supportive measures. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation \\<90%. Mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but clinicians should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation. Acute right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over-distend the right ventricular, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output. Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC)/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors may be needed for hemodynamic support. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with PEs. **Anticoagulation**\nRemembering that anticoagulation is the mainstay of treating acute PE is vital. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; fondaparinux) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred since they lower the incidence of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. UFH is usually only used in patients with hemodynamic instability in whom primary reperfusion treatment might be required or in patients with renal impairment. Newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) can also be used for anticoagulation in PE. **Anticoagulation and hemodynamic stability**\nThe treatment for patients with suspected PE is stratified according to the type of PE (hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the clinician's suspicion index. Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE."

Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE. Anticoagulation is started before diagnostic imaging is obtained for hemodynamically stable patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE. For hemodynamically stable patients with a low clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 24 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion of PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 4 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, IVC filter placement should be considered when the diagnosis of PE is confirmed. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE who are hemodynamically unstable, emergent CTPA, portable perfusion scanning, or bedside transthoracic echocardiography should be performed whenever possible. Primary reperfusion treatment, usually thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamically unstable acute PE. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapy are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis. Following reperfusion treatment and hemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from parenteral to oral anticoagulation. **Reperfusion Strategies**\n**Thrombolysis**\nThrombolysis has shown an effective reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance in patients with PE compared to UFH alone; a decrease in right ventricular dilation on echocardiography assesses these improvements. Thrombolysis is preferred when therapy can be instituted within 48 hours of symptom onset, but it has still shown benefit in patients whose symptoms began less than 14 days ago. A meta-analysis suggested a significant reduction in mortality and recurrent PE using thrombolytics. Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial identified the benefits of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE. It demonstrated that thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but it also showed an increased risk of severe bleeding with thrombolytics."

It demonstrated that thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but it also showed an increased risk of severe bleeding with thrombolytics. Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular disease (eg, arteriovenous malformation), known malignant intracranial neoplasm, ischemic stroke within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, recent surgery encroaching on the spinal canal or brain, and recent significant closed-head or facial trauma with radiographic evidence of bony fracture or brain injury. **Catheter-directed treatment**\nCatheter-directed treatment involves the insertion of a catheter into the pulmonary arteries, which is then used for ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, suction embolectomy, rotational embolectomy, thrombus aspiration, or combining mechanical fragmentation with pharmacological catheter-directed thrombolysis. Different studies have shown a success rate of up to 87% for catheter-directed therapies. Catheter-assisted embolectomy techniques carry the inherent risk of perforating the pulmonary arteries, leading to massive hemoptysis or cardiac tamponade. These complications are rare but fatal. **Surgical embolectomy**\nSurgical embolectomy is usually indicated in a patient with hemodynamically unstable PE in whom thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) is contraindicated or in patients with failed thrombolysis. For thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy, no difference in mortality is evident, but the thrombolysis group had a higher risk of stroke and repeated intervention. **Vena cava filters**\nVena cava filters block the path of travel of emboli and prevent them from entering the pulmonary circulation. Filters are indicated in patients with venous thromboembolism who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulants and in patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation. Retrievable filters are preferred, such that after the contraindication has resolved, the filter can be removed, and patients should be anticoagulated. This is because the Prevention of Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism by Vena Cava Interruption (PREPIC) study showed that the insertion of a permanent vena cava filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent PE and a substantial increase in the risk of DVT, without a remarkable difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death."

    "text": "**Long-Term Treatment and Prevention of Recurrence**\nThe aim of anticoagulation after the acute management of PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and prevent the recurrence of VTE over the long term. Clinical trials have assessed various durations of anticoagulant therapy with VKAs for VTE. The findings of these studies established a treatment protocol for acute PE. First, all patients with PE should receive 3 months or more of anticoagulant treatment. Second, after the anticoagulant treatment is stopped, the risk of recurrence is expected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3 to 6 months compared with more prolonged treatment periods (eg, 12 to 24 months). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by \u226490%, but the risk of bleeding partially offsets this benefit. Oral anticoagulants are highly efficient in preventing recurrent VTE at the time of treatment, but after the discontinuation of treatment, they do not eliminate the risk of subsequent recurrence. Notably, about 30% of PEs are unprovoked. Unprovoked PE (ie, PE in the absence of an identifiable risk factor) is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of recurrence compared to patients who had a provoked PE. Patients with persistent risk factors (eg, cancer or elevated antiphospholipid antibodies) have a higher rate of recurrence than those with transient risk factors (eg, immobilization, surgery, or trauma). Consequently, the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains uncertain and should be individualized. A minimum of 3 months is usually recommended, but a more extended period is required if the PE was unprovoked or persistent risk factors are evident. This need for longer anticoagulation should be assessed at the end of 3 months by considering the patient's bleeding risk. Those with a high bleeding risk can limit therapy to 3 months. Special considerations are required for patients with active cancer, given their increased risk for a VTE event."

While earlier reports reported a high rate of mortality following pulmonary infarction, a study from 2018 found the survival to discharge rate of those suffering from a pulmonary infarction to be high at around 97%. Several prognostic models have been designed, but the PE Severity Index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) are the most commonly used. The PESI score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with an established diagnosis of PE. The principal strength of the PESI and sPESI is identifying patients at low risk for 30-day mortality (PESI classes I and II). **Original and Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index**\nThe following parameters are utilized in each version of the PESI (original version /simplified version ):\n- Age: 1 point (if age older than 80 years)\n- Male sex: +10 points/\u2013\n- Cancer: +30 points/1 point\n- Chronic heart failure: +10 points/1 point\n- Chronic pulmonary disease: +10 points/1 point\n- Pulse rate \u2265110 bpm: +20 points/1 point\n- Systolic BP \\<100 mm Hg: +30 points/1 point\n- Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min: +20 points/\u2013\n- Temperature \\<36 \u00b0C: +20 points/\u2013\n- Altered mental status: +60 points/\u2013\n- Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation \\<90%: +20 points/1 point\nRisk Stratification in PESI includes the following classes:\n- Class I: Points \u226465; low 30-day mortality risk from 1% to 6%."

    "text": "Complications\nThe primary complications associated with PE include:\n- Recurrent thromboembolism\n- Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension\n- Right heart failure\n- Cardiogenic shock\nPE, if left untreated, is associated with mortality of up to 30%. Studies have also suggested an increased risk of stroke, thought to be due to paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale in patients with acute PE.\n**Recurrent Thromboembolism**\nIn the 1 to 2 weeks following diagnosis, patients may deteriorate and experience recurrence. Inadequate anticoagulation is the most common reason for recurrent venous thromboembolism while on therapy.\n**Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension**\nThe development of persistent or progressive dyspnea, particularly during the first 3 months to 2 years after diagnosis, should prompt the clinician to investigate the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which affects up to 5% of patients. In patients who remain persistently symptomatic months to years after an acute PE, follow-up CT, ventilation-perfusion scans, or echocardiography should be performed. These modalities demonstrate pulmonary hypertension in CTEPH.\nOn the V/Q scan, patients with CTEPH generally have at least 1 segmental or more significant mismatched ventilation-perfusion defect. For those patients with evidence of CTEPH on V/Q lung scanning, right heart catheterization, and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction or a secondary arteriopathy, for all patients with CTEPH, lifelong anticoagulant therapy is recommended. Also, early referral for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is highly recommended."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nEffective management of acute PE requires seamless interprofessional collaboration to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure patient safety. Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as an innovative approach to addressing the complexities of PE treatment. Composed of specialists in pulmonary medicine, critical care, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery, PERTs facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention, ensuring that patients benefit from the collective expertise of diverse disciplines. Studies demonstrate that PERTs improve communication, streamline treatment efforts, and lead to more coordinated and effective care.\nIn the larger framework of an interprofessional team, nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practitioners play pivotal roles alongside physicians. As frontline clinicians, nurses contribute critical observations and ensure the timely implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Pharmacists, as experts in anticoagulation therapy, provide essential input on drug selection, contraindications, and potential interactions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatment. Open communication and mutual respect among all healthcare professionals allow for comprehensive and well-informed decision-making, empowering each team member to contribute actively to patient care.\nBy fostering a collaborative environment, PERTs and interprofessional teams optimize care coordination and team performance. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities, effective communication, and a unified strategy, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved safety in managing acute PE. Integrating diverse expertise within a cohesive team ensures patients receive timely, evidence-based, patient-centered care."
