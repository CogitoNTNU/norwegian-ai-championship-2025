    "text": "Introduction\nMountainous regions are a destination for adventure travel, seasonal work, and permanent residence for many people. More than 40 million people visit high altitude areas (greater than 2500 meters) every year, and a reported 140 million have a permanent residence at these elevations. The decreased barometric and partial pressures of oxygen at high altitudes can reduce inspired oxygen levels compared to sea levels. The body's exaggerated physiological response to rapid ascent, a lower level of inspired oxygen, or the persistent hypoxic stimulus experienced at high altitude can cause significant morbidity and mortality. High altitude-associated disease processes can vary from mild to life-threatening. The body's response can present in acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and, ultimately, high-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH). Acute mountain sickness develops secondary to rapid ascent and can be described as a \"hangover, \" including nonspecific symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia.\nHigh altitude pulmonary edema is a progression of acute mountain sickness and presents with acute pulmonary, a complication of the body's poor acclimatization. High altitude cerebral edema, the most feared complication of altitude sickness, involves cerebral edema and associated neurological symptoms and sequela. Chronic hypoxic stimuli of high altitude living can result in permanent pulmonary vascular remodeling due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and define a subgroup of pulmonary hypertension known as HAPH. This topic focuses primarily on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of HAPH."

This topic focuses primarily on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of HAPH. Pathophysiology\nHypoxic stress at high altitudes induces a variety of physiological changes. Many organ systems utilize vasodilation to enhance oxygen delivery in hypoxia. In contrast, the lung responds to hypoxia with increased pulmonary vasoconstriction. Blood is shunted away from poorly oxygenated lung zones towards healthy alveoli to minimize V/Q mismatch. This intuitively makes sense in the setting of lobar pneumonia or other focal disease processes involving the lung. In HAPH, all lung fields experience the same degree of hypoxia. Significant vasoconstriction in all parts of the lung and elevated pulmonary artery pressures lead to pulmonary hypertension. The increased pulmonary pressure forces fluid into the lungs, causing acute pulmonary edema.\nVascular remodeling plays a major role in the pathophysiology of HAPH. Hypoxia ultimately leads to vascular remodeling by triggering pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance in the small pulmonary veins and arteries. At the cellular level, chronic hypoxia causes channelopathy of both potassium and calcium channels, increasing intracellular calcium. The proliferation of smooth muscle within the pulmonary vasculature occurs, a structure normally devoid of smooth muscle cells (fibroblasts). Vascular remodeling can be a long-term and irreversible sequela of chronic hypoxia and persist despite the removal of the hypoxic stimulus.\nEndothelial nitrous oxide is theorized to play a role in the development of HAPH. Longstanding hypoxia is known to decrease nitrous oxide synthesis, contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Research and comparison of different subpopulations have demonstrated that increased nitrous oxide concentrations in pulmonary endothelium decrease the prevalence of HAPH. Studies have shown that individuals from Tibet have high nitrous oxide concentrations, which correlates with a lower prevalence of HAPH than the South American Andean population."

Studies have shown that individuals from Tibet have high nitrous oxide concentrations, which correlates with a lower prevalence of HAPH than the South American Andean population. Evaluation\nPatients who present with signs and symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea, fatigue, or peripheral edema should be evaluated for heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. To diagnose HAPH, the patient must reside at an elevation greater than 2,500 meters. Other diagnoses besides pulmonary hypertension should always be considered. Diagnostic tests that can be utilized are an EKG, echocardiogram, chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, or a right-sided heart catheterization with pulmonary angiography.\n- An EKG can be consistent with chronic right heart strain and have findings of right ventricular hypertrophy, right bundle branch block, and tall p-waves in inferior leads.\n- An echocardiogram can show a dilated right ventricle and right atrium and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Left ventricular function and ejection fraction must also be assessed to rule out left-sided heart failure.\n- The chest X-ray may be normal or show signs of cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion.\n- Pulmonary function tests are useful in excluding diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or other interstitial lung diseases.\nRight-sided heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography are the most important diagnostic tools for establishing a definitive diagnosis. A mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) greater than 30 mmHg or systolic PAP of greater than 50 mmHg is diagnostic for pulmonary hypertension. If possible, it is important to attempt catheterization and angiography at the altitude of residence."

If possible, it is important to attempt catheterization and angiography at the altitude of residence. Treatment / Management\nLimited data is currently available to guide the long-term management of HAPH. Several studies have shown that some treatments recommended for managing other causes of pulmonary hypertension have improved symptoms and mPAPs. Patients suffering from HAPH should be advised to move to lower altitudes. Some studies have shown that mPAPs for patients have normalized within 2 years of returning to lower altitudes. Pharmacological treatments for HAPH can include phosphodiesterase and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, Sildenafil) block the breakdown of nitrous oxide, promote pulmonary artery vasodilation, and decrease mPAP.\n- Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (ie, Acetazolamide) are useful in preventing acute mountain sickness. Studies have also shown a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. However, Acetazolamide has not been studied specifically for treating HAPH, and the benefits may be minimal. Due to Acetazolamide's low side effect profile, it is safe to incorporate as a treatment option.\n- Endothelin receptor blockers (ie, Bosentan) have also been used to treat pulmonary hypertension.\nSome studies have shown that venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be beneficial for severe cases in the acute setting. Despite all efforts and recommendations, if an individual develops irreversible pulmonary hypertension, the mainstay of treatment is pulmonary transplantation."
