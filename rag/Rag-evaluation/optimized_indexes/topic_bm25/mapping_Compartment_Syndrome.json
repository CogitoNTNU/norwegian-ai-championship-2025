    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nAbdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a serious condition that occurs when the pressure in the abdominal cavity rises above 20 mmHg and causes end-organ damage. Persistently elevated intra-abdominal pressures (IAP) can cause long-term organ dysfunction and can be potentially fatal if not promptly recognized and treated. Many cases of elevated IAP go unrecognized because a physical exam is not sensitive in detecting this condition; therefore, it is essential to understand the risk factors and associated treatments of ACS. This review activity focuses on the pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of this condition, emphasizing the critical role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating ACS.\n**Objectives:**\n- Evaluate patients with significant fluid shifts, especially those with associated clinical instability, for abdominal compartment syndrome by routinely measuring intra-abdominal pressure and utilizing established criteria from the World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) guidelines.\n- Assess and evaluate the impact of elevated intra-abdominal pressure on surrounding organ systems, recognizing the potential for multi-organ dysfunction, and incorporate this holistic perspective into abdominal compartment syndrome management decisions.\n- Select appropriate interventions, whether medical or surgical, based on the patient's clinical presentation and IAP measurements, aiming for timely and effective abdominal compartment syndrome management.\n- Communicate effectively with interdisciplinary healthcare teams to ensure coordinated care and timely interventions for patients at risk or diagnosed with abdominal compartment syndrome."

Introduction\nCompartment syndrome can occur in any anatomical area with increased pressure in a confined body space, resulting in poor blood flow, cellular damage, and eventual organ dysfunction. These compartments are restricted by muscles and fascia, limiting the compartment's ability to expand as pressure progressively increases. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is especially well-studied due to its prevalence in critically ill patients and the potential for multisystem organ failure. The World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) was created in 2004. This society standardized the definitions and guidelines for evaluating and treating ACS, as this disease process is often underdiagnosed in the medical field. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the steady-state pressure within the abdomen. The average normal adult IAP ranges from 0 to 5 mm Hg, while IAP can be elevated up to 5 to 7 mm Hg in critically ill patients. Both patient body habitus and chronic medical conditions can influence the patient's baseline IAP; thus, they must be considered during ACS evaluation. Elevated IAP can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), defined as IAP \u2265 12 mm Hg, but is not synonymous with ACS. ACS can occur when IAP is >20 mm Hg. However, the beginning phases of organ dysfunction can occur before IAP reaches 20 mm Hg. Failure to recognize and immediately manage ACS can lead to poor prognosis and is recognized as an independent predictor of mortality. High clinical suspicion with protocolized monitoring and management should be implemented when treating critically ill patients, especially those with significant fluid shifts. This diagnosis should always be considered in patients with tense and distended abdomens and associated clinical instability."

This diagnosis should always be considered in patients with tense and distended abdomens and associated clinical instability. Etiology\nAbdominal compliance is primarily determined by the elasticity of the abdominal wall and diaphragm. Increased intra-abdominal pressure can cause vasculature dysfunction, including loss of vasomotor tone and compromised endothelial intercellular junctions. IAH also causes increased antidiuretic hormone release, further increasing volume retention. As IAH is viewed as a physiologic continuum. The WSACS recommended that IAH be divided into four grades as follows:\n- Grade I: IAP 12-15 mm Hg\n- Grade II: IAP 16-20 mm Hg\n- Grade III: IAP 21-25 mm Hg\n- Grade IV: IAP >25 mm Hg\nIntra-abdominal hypertension in the presence of organ dysfunction raises suspicion for ACS. Surgical procedures that carry an especially high risk of developing IAH include liver transplantation, damage control surgery, repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and large abdominal hernia repairs. Other etiologies must be considered in addition to surgery as potential causes of ACS, which can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary ACS causes include blunt or penetrating trauma, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, abdominal adhesions, intestinal obstruction, tumor formation, and retroperitoneal hematoma. Secondary causes do not originate from intra-abdominal disease, including pregnancy, ascites, ileus, intra-abdominal sepsis, and large-volume fluid resuscitation. Intra-abdominal pressures can be chronically elevated in pregnancy, cirrhosis, obesity, intra-abdominal malignancy, and peritoneal dialysis. Those with higher body mass index can be expected to have higher baseline IAP between 9 to 14 mm Hg due to the restrictive effect of adipose tissue. The causes of IAH and ACS can be broken down into the following categories:\n**Diminished abdominal wall compliance:** abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal adhesions, major trauma, major burns, mechanical ventilation, obesity. **Increased intraluminal volume:** gastroparesis, gastric distension, ileus, constipation, toxic megacolon, volvulus."

Pathophysiology\nElevated intra-abdominal pressures can affect multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. **Cardiovascular System**\nThe cardiovascular system can be affected in multiple ways due to elevated IAP. IAH can cause compression of the inferior vena cava, reducing venous blood return to the heart and causing lower extremity edema. Decreased venous return can also lead to reduced cardiac output, resulting in less blood and oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Additionally, the increased IAP causes the diaphragm to move upwards, which raises the intra-thoracic pressures and places direct pressure on the heart, ultimately decreasing ventricular compliance. **Pulmonary System**\nElevated intrathoracic pressures limit pulmonary compliance, thus decreasing tidal volume and functional residual capacity and increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Airway pressures increase, and patients can have difficulties ventilating. Alveoli exhibit atelectasis, increasing the dead space. Thus, gas exchange is adversely affected as less oxygen is transported and more carbon dioxide is retained, leading to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. **Renal System**\nIAH can compromise the renal system by decreasing renal arterial and venous blood flow, affecting the glomerular filtration rate and ultimately causing acute kidney injury and subsequent reduction in urine output. Blood is diverted from the renal cortex, further impairing renal function. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, leading to increased systemic vascular resistance through angiotensin II and increased reabsorption of water and sodium mediated by aldosterone. Studies indicate that oliguria can occur at an IAP of 15 mm Hg and anuria at pressures of 30 mm Hg. **Gastrointestinal System**\nDecreased abdominal compliance with increased IAP leads to decreased splanchnic blood flow, causing tissue hypoxia, increased capillary permeability, and edema."

Evaluation\nImaging modalities are not standard practice for the diagnosis of ACS. However, imaging can show early indicators of IAH that may ultimately lead to ACS, such as peritoneal-to-abdominal height ratio >0.52, a maximal anteroposterior to transverse abdominal diameter ratio of >0.8, bowel wall thickening, elevation of the diaphragm, narrowing of the vena cava \\<3 mm, and a large amount of intra-abdominal fluid. The most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis is measuring the intra-abdominal pressure. The IAP should be measured anytime there is a known IAH risk. IAP measurement can be achieved using both direct and indirect methods. Direct methods include using pressure transducers (eg, Veress needle during laparoscopic surgery) or intraperitoneal catheters (eg, peritoneal dialysis catheter). These methods are highly accurate but are invasive. The most accepted method of measuring IAP is the use of indirect IAP measurements through intravesicular catheter pressures. This is the most practical approach due to its widespread availability and limited invasiveness. This technique involves aseptic clamping of the Foley catheter and connecting the Foley to a 3-way stopcock adjusted to the level of the mid-axillary line at the iliac crest to zero the transducer. 25 cc of sterile saline is then injected into the bladder. Measurements should be taken at end-expiration with the patient in a complete supine position. Bladder pressures below 5 mm Hg are expected in healthy patients. Pressures between 10 to 15 mm Hg can be expected following abdominal surgery and in obese patients. Bladder pressures over 25 mm Hg are highly suspicious of ACS and should be correlated clinically."

Bladder pressures over 25 mm Hg are highly suspicious of ACS and should be correlated clinically. Treatment / Management\nChoosing the appropriate intervention and timing of the intervention is determined by the etiology of the elevated IAP, the duration of increased IAP, and the degree of organ dysfunction. Not every patient with ACS will immediately need surgical decompression, as nonsurgical interventions can decrease intra-abdominal volume and ultimately improve IAP. If clinically indicated, intraluminal volume can be reduced with nasogastric decompression, rectal tube decompression, or endoscopic decompression. Percutaneous drainage can reduce extraluminal volume in the case of ascites or hematoma. Abdominal wall compliance can be improved with adequate sedation and neuromuscular blockade, removal of constrictive dressings, and eschar release, among other options. Other recommendations made by the WSACS include optimizing fluid administration, resuscitating with hypertonic products or colloids, consideration of hemodialysis or ultrafiltration, and goal-directed resuscitation. However, the quality of evidence is low and needs to be considered when using conservative measures. Percutaneous catheter drainage is a viable option for ACS caused by increased extraluminal abdominal volume. It is far less invasive than a surgical laparotomy and can also be used temporarily if surgical decompression is not an immediate option. Excess extraluminal abdominal volume is caused by excess air, fluid, or blood in the abdominal cavity. If conservative medical management does not lead to improved IAH and further organ damage is noted, surgical decompression using emergent laparotomy should be considered. With surgical abdominal decompression, organ dysfunction may also improve rapidly, as most organ dysfunction is seen as a direct sequelae from compromised blood flow or mechanical obstruction. After surgical decompression, the abdominal fascia may be left open temporarily."

After surgical decompression, the abdominal fascia may be left open temporarily. The open wound is often covered by a negative pressure dressing system, which helps minimize the risks of infections and fistulas, decreases insensible losses, and prevents retraction of the fascia. With clinical improvement, the patient can return to the operating room within several days for further evaluation and attempted fascial closure, which can be achieved with mesh or primary closure techniques. However, some of these approaches may not be feasible at all facilities due to limited resources. Although surgical decompression is considered a definitive treatment for ACS, it can be associated with many complications, especially when the abdomen wall is left open. Some complications include fistula formation, protein loss by drainage of peritoneal fluid, abdominal wall retraction with ventral hernia development, and wound infection. In addition, up to 20% of surgical decompression is associated with recurrent ACS either due to ongoing causative agents or inadequate lowering of IAP. Despite extensive literature published on ACS, the ideal timing for surgical decompression is debatable. Early pursuit of surgical intervention can exacerbate stress on the patient from the surgery itself. Thus, the consensus within the medical community is to consider surgery when multiple conservative management treatments have not improved the patient's condition."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe diagnosis and management of ACS require an interprofessional team approach. The condition can present subtly, and the diagnosis can easily be missed. ACS is very common in medical and surgical ICUs, with many studies showing an IAH prevalence of 30% to 40%. One survey of specialists found that non-surgical specialists were comparatively less familiar with recognizing, diagnosing, and managing ACS than surgical specialists. Ideally, monitoring all critically ill patients for ACS should be established as a routine practice among institutions; however, monitoring may be limited due to a lack of understanding or limited resources. Overall, the outcomes for some patients with ACS can be poor due to effects on multiple organ systems and underlying comorbidities. However, those diagnosed and treated promptly with the involvement of the appropriate specialties have improved outcomes, and early treatment of ACS minimizes end-organ damage. Thus, it is essential to involve general surgeons in caring for patients at high risk of developing or currently having an acute abdomen. Surgeons can assist with the workup management and monitor the patient in case the patient requires surgery. Patients with ACS should be closely monitored in the ICU with intensivists familiar with the disease process. Pharmacists play a crucial role in enhancing pain management and sedation by identifying suitable medications for patients. Nurses must monitor vital signs, abdominal girth, wound care, and urine output. Critical team members include nutritionists, physical and occupational therapists, and respiratory therapists. Patients who develop ACS and need surgical intervention have a prolonged recovery and require long-term care."

Acute compartment syndrome is considered a **surgical emergency** since, without proper treatment, it can lead to ischemia and eventually necrosis. Generally, acute compartment syndrome is considered a clinical diagnosis. However, intracompartmental pressure (ICP) > 30 mmHg can be used as a threshold to aid in diagnosis. However, a single normal ICP reading does not exclude acute compartment syndrome.\nFascia is a thin, inelastic sheet of connective tissue that surrounds muscle compartments and limits the capacity for rapid expansion. In the leg, there are four muscle compartments: anterior, lateral, deep posterior, and superficial posterior. The **anterior compartment of the leg** is the most common location for compartment syndrome. This compartment contains the extensor muscles of the toes, the tibialis anterior muscle, the deep peroneal nerve, and the tibial artery.\nOther locations in which acute compartment syndrome is seen include the forearm, thigh, buttock, shoulder, hand, and foot. It can also be seen in the abdomen, but more commonly, it presents in the limbs.\nSignificant attention should be paid to patients with open fractures. Recent retrospective studies indicate that skin laceration would not relieve the pressure inside the muscle compartments. Therefore, acute compartment syndrome is still predictable. This is especially pertinent for open Gustilo type 2 and 3 lesions in proximal intra-articular tibia fractures."

This is especially pertinent for open Gustilo type 2 and 3 lesions in proximal intra-articular tibia fractures. Pathophysiology\nAcute compartment syndrome occurs due to decreased intracompartmental space or increased intracompartmental fluid volume because the surrounding fascia is inherently non-compliant. As the compartment pressure increases, hemodynamics are impaired. There is normally an equilibrium between venous outflow and arterial inflow. When there is an increase in compartmental pressure, there is a reduction in venous outflow. This causes venous pressure and, thus, venous capillary pressure to increase. If the intracompartmental pressure becomes higher than arterial pressure, a decrease in arterial inflow will also occur. The reduction of venous outflow and arterial inflow result in decreased oxygenation of tissues causing ischemia. If the deficit of oxygenation becomes high enough, irreversible necrosis may occur.\nThe normal pressure within a compartment is less than 10 mmHg. If the intracompartmental pressure reaches 30 mmHg or greater, acute compartment syndrome is present. However, a single normal ICP reading does not exclude acute compartment syndrome. ICP should be monitored serially or continuously."

History and Physical\nAcute compartment syndrome typically occurs within a few hours of inciting trauma. However, it can present up to 48 hours after. The earliest objective physical finding is the **tense** , or ''wood-like\" feeling of the involved compartment. **Pain** is typically severe, out of proportion to the injury. Early on, pain may only be present with passive stretching. However, this symptom may be absent in advanced acute compartment syndrome. In the initial stages, pain may be characterized as a burning sensation or as a deep ache of the involved compartment. Paresthesia, hypoesthesia, or poorly localized deep muscular pain may also be present.\nClassically, the presentation of acute compartment syndrome has been remembered by \"The Five P's\": pain, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and pallor. However, aside from paresthesia, which may occur earlier in the course of the condition, these are typically late findings. Beware that the presence or absence of a palpable arterial pulse may not accurately indicate relative tissue pressure or predict the risk for compartment syndrome. In some patients, a pulse is still present, even in a severely compromised extremity.\n**Physical exam** should focus on the neurovascular territory of the involved compartment:\n- Observe skin for lesions, swelling, or color change\n- Palpate over the compartment, observing temperature, tension, tenderness\n- Check pulses\n- Evaluate two-point discrimination and sensation\n- Evaluate motor function\nAlthough the clinical features discussed above can help identify compartment syndrome, they have limited sensitivity and specificity. Other factors, such as compartment pressures, can help make the diagnosis.\nDue to the potential for rapid progression of compartment syndrome, clinicians should perform serial exams."

However, the following are done to evaluate further and to confirm the diagnosis. - Radiographs should be obtained if a fracture is suspected\n- Measurement of intracompartmental pressure is not required but can aid in diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Compartment pressures are often measured with a manometer, a device that detects intracompartmental pressure by measuring the resistance that is present when a saline solution is injected into the compartment. Another method employs a slit catheter, whereby a catheter is placed within the compartment, and the pressure is measured with an arterial line transducer. The slit catheter method is more accurate and allows for continuous monitoring.

For patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for acute compartment syndrome but who are at high risk based on history and physical exam findings, or for patients with intracompartmental pressures between 15 to 20 mmHg, serial intracompartmental pressure measurements are recommended. Patients with ICPs between 20-30 mmHg should be admitted and the surgical team should be consulted. For patients with intracompartmental pressures greater than 30 mmHg or delta pressures less than 30 mmHg, surgical fasciotomy should be done. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency, so prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, immediate surgical fasciotomy is needed to reduce the intracompartmental pressure. The ideal timeframe for fasciotomy is within six hours of injury, and fasciotomy is not recommended after 36 hours following injury. When tissue pressure remains elevated for that amount of time, irreversible damage may occur, and fasciotomy may not be beneficial in this situation. If necrosis occurs before fasciotomy is performed, there is a high likelihood of infection which may require amputation."
