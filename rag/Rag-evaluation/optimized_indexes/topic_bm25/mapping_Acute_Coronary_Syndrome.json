    "text": "History and Physical\nThe classic symptom of ACS is substernal chest pain, often described as crushing or pressure-like feeling, radiating to the jaw and/or left arm. This classic presentation is not seen always, and the presenting complaint can be very vague and subtle with chief complaints often being difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, isolated jaw or left arm pain, nausea, epigastric pain, diaphoresis, and weakness. Female gender, patients with diabetes, and older age are all associated with ACS presenting with vague symptoms. A high degree of suspicion is warranted in such cases.\nIn the physical exam, general distress and diaphoresis are often seen. Heart sounds are frequently normal. At times, gallop and murmur can be heard. Lung exam is normal, although at times crackles may be heard pointing toward associated congestive heart failure (CHF). Bilateral leg edema may be present indicating CHF. The rest of the systems are typically within normal limits unless co-pathologies are present. The presence of abdominal tenderness to palpation should make the provider consider other pathologies like pancreatitis and gastritis. The presence of unequal pulses warrants consideration of aortic dissection. The presence of unilateral leg swelling should warrant work-up for pulmonary emboli. Hence a thorough physical exam is very important to rule out other life-threatening differentials."

Hence a thorough physical exam is very important to rule out other life-threatening differentials. Treatment / Management\nThe initial treatment for all ACS includes aspirin (300 mg) and heparin bolus and intravenous (IV) heparin infusion if there are no contraindications to the same. Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor or clopidogrel is also recommended. The choice depends on local cardiologist preference. Ticagrelor is not given to the patients receiving thrombolysis. Supportive measures like pain control with morphine/ fentanyl and oxygen in case of hypoxia are provided as required. Nitroglycerin sublingual or infusion can be used for pain relief as well. In cases of inferior wall ischemia, nitroglycerine can cause severe hypotension and should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmia is warranted. Further Treatment of ACS depends on whether it is a STEMI /NSTEMI or unstable angina. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends an emergent catheterization and percutaneous intervention (PCI) for STEMI with door to procedure start time of fewer than 90 minutes. A thrombolytic (tenecteplase or other thrombolytic) is recommended if there is no PCI available and the patient cannot be transferred to the catheterization lab in less than 120 minutes. AHA guideline dictates the door to needle (TNK/other thrombolytics) time to be less than 30 minutes. NSTEMI/Unstable Angina-Symptom control is tried along with the initial treatment with aspirin, and heparin. If the patient continues to have pain, then urgent catheterization is recommended. If symptoms are controlled effectively, then a decision can be made for the timing of catheterization and other evaluation techniques including myocardial perfusion study from case to case basis depending on comorbidities. ACS always warrants admission and emergent cardiology evaluation. Computerized tomography angiography might also be utilized for further workup depending on availability and cardiologist preference."
