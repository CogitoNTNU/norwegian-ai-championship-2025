    "text": "Introduction\nC-reactive protein (CRP), first identified by Tillett and Francis in 1930, derives its name from its reaction with the _C_ carbohydrate antigen in the capsule of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ during acute inflammation. CRP is a pentameric protein synthesized by the liver in response to inflammation, with a molecular weight of approximately 115 kDa. This substance exhibits a characteristic \"jelly-like lectin fold.\" CRP typically consists of 5 identical subunits arranged into a cyclic pentamer around a central pore. However, the protein exists in 2 primary isoforms: the pentameric form (pCRP) and the monomeric form (mCRP). PCRP is the circulating form under normal conditions and is primarily anti-inflammatory. Meanwhile, mCRP arises during inflammation and has pro-inflammatory effects. The transition between these 2 forms occurs when pCRP dissociates into monomers, typically in response to tissue damage or other inflammatory stimuli. This structural shift is significant as mCRP exhibits pro-inflammatory properties, such as platelet activation, leukocyte recruitment, and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions. These structural and functional differences underscore CRP's dual role in inflammation, both as a mediator of anti-inflammatory responses and a promoter of inflammatory processes during pathological conditions. CRP functions as an acute-phase reactant, primarily induced by interleukin 6 acting on the hepatic gene responsible for CRP transcription during inflammatory or infectious processes. Studies have explored the potential link between CRP dysregulation in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris and the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), though definitive evidence is currently lacking. Animal models of alveolitis have demonstrated protective effects of CRP in lung tissue, where it reduces neutrophil-mediated alveolar damage and protein leakage into the lungs. This protein plays a role in recognizing and facilitating the clearance of foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to phosphocholine, phospholipids, histones, chromatin, and fibronectin (see **Image**. C-Reactive Protein Isoforms and Their Phosphocholine Complexes)."

    "text": "This protein plays a role in recognizing and facilitating the clearance of foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to phosphocholine, phospholipids, histones, chromatin, and fibronectin (see **Image**. C-Reactive Protein Isoforms and Their Phosphocholine Complexes). CRP activates the classical complement pathway and engages phagocytic cells via Fc receptors, expediting the removal of apoptotic cells, necrotic debris, and pathogens. Pathologic activation can occur in autoimmune processes when CRP binds to autoantibodies that expose phosphocholine residues. This mechanism contributes to disease in conditions such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In certain contexts, CRP-mediated complement activation may exacerbate tissue damage through downstream inflammatory cytokine release. Unlike the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which indirectly reflects inflammation, CRP levels change rapidly in response to inflammatory stimuli. CRP concentrations increase acutely and decline promptly once the underlying trigger resolves. Chronic elevation may indicate ongoing inflammation from persistent infections or inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Numerous conditions can elevate CRP levels, including both acute and chronic processes, whether infectious or noninfectious. Markedly elevated CRP concentrations most commonly reflect infection, representing an example of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition. Trauma can also induce a significant elevation of CRP through the alarmin response. More modest CRP increases often arise from a broader spectrum of stimuli, including sleep disturbances, periodontal disease, or low-grade systemic inflammation. Higher CRP levels correlate with reduced engagement in light physical activity or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, as well as increased sedentary time."

Higher CRP levels correlate with reduced engagement in light physical activity or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, as well as increased sedentary time. Specimen Collection\nA peripheral venous blood sample is typically obtained by a phlebotomist. The procedure involves placing a snug tourniquet around the upper arm while the patient pumps their fist several times to promote venous distention. The phlebotomist palpates for a suitable vein, cleanses the site with an alcohol pad, and allows the area to air-dry before introducing the needle. Once the blood is collected into a vial, the tourniquet is released, and the needle is withdrawn. Manual pressure is applied to the venipuncture site until hemostasis is achieved, usually within 1 minute, followed by placement of a bandage. Medication history should be reviewed, as certain drugs may affect CRP levels (see **Interfering Factors**). Fasting is not required before testing. No special preparations are necessary. Minor complications may include localized oozing, bruising, or tenderness. Infection at the venipuncture site is rare. Although other body fluids, such as synovial fluid, may contain CRP, testing these fluids is not a routine practice. CRP quantification is performed using immunoassays or laser nephelometry\u2014methods that are inexpensive, accurate, and rapid. For detecting lower concentrations of CRP (0.3-1.0 mg/L), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) assays are preferred due to greater precision at low levels. The term \"high-sensitivity\" refers solely to the analytical technique, not to a distinct clinical interpretation or differential diagnosis. Recent advances have introduced reliable point-of-care CRP testing options cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ProciseDx CRP Assay, approved in 2022, delivers quantitative CRP results from serum samples in under 5 minutes using a compact fluorescence-based device."

Potential Diagnosis\nCRP elevation in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), cancer, COVID-19, or obesity may aid in predicting VTE risk. Log-transformed hsCRP-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (Ln HCHR) and log-transformed hsCRP-to-lymphocyte count ratio (Ln HCLR) show a positive association with the prevalence of heart failure in the U.S. population.\nHigher CRP levels serve as independent risk factors for cardiac mortality and are directly proportional to the risk of cardiovascular disease. Elevated CRP plasma levels also correlate with cancer risk, with higher levels observed in gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer. Elevated CRP may serve as a potential biomarker for stratifying cancer risk.\nIn patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, increased CRP levels independently associate with a heightened risk of both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).\nFrailty, characterized by multisystem dysregulation, decreased resilience, reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to stressors, is emerging as closely linked to low-grade chronic inflammation. Higher levels of hsCRP correlate with an increased risk of frailty progression."

Results are typically presented in either mg/dL or mg/L, with hsCRP commonly reported in mg/dL.\nThe standard interpretation of CRP levels is as follows:\n- Less than 0.3 mg/dL: Normal, typically observed in most healthy adults\n- 0.3 to 1.0 mg/dL: Normal or minor elevation, often seen in conditions such as obesity, pregnancy, depression, diabetes, common cold, gingivitis, periodontitis, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and genetic polymorphisms\n- 1.0 to 10.0 mg/dL: Moderate elevation, commonly associated with systemic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, other autoimmune diseases, malignancies, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, and bronchitis\n- More than 10.0 mg/dL: Marked elevation, typically linked to acute bacterial infections, viral infections, systemic vasculitis, and major trauma\n- More than 50.0 mg/dL: Severe elevation, generally seen in acute bacterial infections\nWhen used for cardiac risk stratification, hsCRP levels are interpreted as follows:\n- Below 1 mg/dL: Low cardiovascular risk\n- Between 1 and 3 mg/dL: Moderate cardiovascular risk\n- Above 3 mg/dL: High cardiovascular risk\nThe interpretation of CRP levels is essential for assessing the degree of inflammation and associated risks in patients. Clinicians can use these values to monitor disease progression, guide treatment strategies, and identify potential complications."

Interfering Factors\nCertain pharmacological agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins, can reduce CRP levels. Recent injury or illness may elevate levels, particularly when using the test for cardiac risk stratification. Magnesium supplementation can diminish CRP levels.\nEmerging pharmacological agents, including biologics like the interleukin 6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab, have demonstrated efficacy in lowering CRP levels in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, have been associated with reductions in CRP levels, reflecting their anti-inflammatory properties. Sustained reductions in CRP levels have also been associated with lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, improved sleep quality, stress reduction strategies, and adherence to anti-inflammatory dietary patterns.\nGenetic polymorphisms within the CRP gene, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region, can influence baseline CRP levels. These genetic variations may account for individual differences in CRP concentrations and should be considered when interpreting results.\nMild CRP elevations may occur in the absence of overt systemic inflammation. Levels tend to be higher in women and older adults. Chronic conditions, such as obesity, smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and insomnia, are associated with low-grade inflammation and can elevate CRP, requiring cautious interpretation in these contexts.\nMental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, have been explored in relation to CRP levels. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, including medical, social, and demographic factors such as sex, age, and race, these associations tend to weaken, suggesting indirect rather than causal relationships."
