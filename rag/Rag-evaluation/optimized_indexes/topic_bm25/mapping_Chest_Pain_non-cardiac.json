    "text": "History and Physical\n**History**\nLike all workups, chest pain evaluation starts with taking a complete history. Start by getting a good understanding of their complaint. - Onset: In addition to when the pain started, ask what the patient was doing when the pain started. Was the pain brought on by exertion, or were they at rest? - Location: Can the patient localize the pain with one finger, or is it diffuse? - Duration: How long did the pain last? - Character: Let the patient describe the pain in his or her own words. - Aggravation/alleviating factors: It is very important to find out what makes the pain worse. Is there an exertional component, is it associated with eating or breathing? Is there a positional component? Don't forget to ask about new workout routines, sports, and lifting. Ask what medications they have tried. - Radiation: This may clue you into visceral pain. - Timing: How many times do they experience this pain? For how long does it let up? Ask about other symptoms, such as:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Fever\n- Diaphoresis\n- Cough\n- Dyspepsia\n- Edema\n- Calf pain or swelling\n- Recent illness\nEvaluate for any of the following risk factors:\n- ACS risks: prior myocardial infarction(MI), family history of cardiac disease, smoking, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes\n- Pulmonary embolism (PE) risks: prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE, hormone use (including oral birth control), recent surgery, cancer, or periods of non-ambulation\n- Recent gastrointestinal (GI) procedures like scopes\n- Drug abuse (cocaine and methamphetamines)\nCarefully review the patient\u2019s medical history for cardiac history, coagulopathies, and kidney disease. Ask about family history, especially cardiac, and ask about social histories like drug use and tobacco use. Once you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities."

Once you have thoroughly ruled out life-threatening causes, move on to other possibilities. Treatment / Management\n**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\nA complete discussion of the management of ACS is beyond the scope of this paper; however, initial steps should be performed in patients with a diagnosis of ACS. Place patient on a cardiac monitor, establish intravascular access (IV) access, give 162 mg to 325 mg chewable aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (unless bypass surgery is imminent), control pain and consider oxygen (O2) therapy. Nitroglycerin has shown a mortality benefit, aiming for a 10% mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction in normotensive patients and a 30% MAP reduction in hypertensive patients; avoid in hypotensive patients and those with inferior ST elevation. Patients with ST elevation on ECG patients should receive immediate reperfusion therapy, either pharmacologic (thrombolytics) or transfer to the catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is preferred and should be initiated within 90 minutes onsite or 120 minutes if transferred to an outside facility. If PCI is not possible, thrombolytics should be initiated within 30 min. Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina should be admitted for a cardiology consult and workup. Patients with stable angina may be appropriate for outpatient workup. In elderly patients and those with comorbidities, patients should be admitted for observation and further cardiac workup. **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the best confirmatory test, a VQ scan can also be used, but this test is not as accurate in patients with chronic lung disease. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be started on thrombolytics; stable patients should be started on anticoagulants. **Pneumothorax (PTX)**\nPneumothorax should be decompressed with a chest tube. **Pericardial tamponade**\nBedside ultrasound is useful for establishing a diagnosis. A fluid bolus may be used as a temporizing measure."

CT angiography is the best test to evaluate for dissection. Place two large-boar IVs and quickly lower the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic between 100 mmHg to 130 mmHg. Start with beta-blocker therapy to prevent reflux tachycardia. **Esophageal perforation**\nA left pleural effusion on a chest x-ray may suggest esophageal rupture. A contrast esophagram is the best confirmatory test. This is a medical emergency, and an immediate surgical consult is warranted. **Gastrointestinal reflux disease**\nThe patient can be given viscous lidocaine mixed with Maalox (known as a GI cocktail). While this is therapeutic, it is not diagnostic. ACS can present with dyspepsia and may respond to a GI cocktail; it is, therefore, important to rule out ACS before assigning GERD as a final diagnosis. Long-term treatment of GERD is best accomplished with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker therapy."
