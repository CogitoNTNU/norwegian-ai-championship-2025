    "text": "Introduction\nInfective endocarditis occurs globally and is the infection of the endocardial surface of the native valve, prosthetic heart valve, or an implanted cardiac device such as a permanent pacemaker or a cardioverter-defibrillator. Over the past few decades, there has been a change in both the host and the pathogen. _Staphylococcus aureus_ has surpassed Streptococcus as the most common etiologic pathogen worldwide and especially in the developed world given its common association with healthcare contact and invasive procedures. Changes in the host include older and sicker patients who carry a high burden of comorbidities. Resistance to antibiotics is another challenge threatening healthcare worldwide and seems to be growing.\nDespite technological advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the overall mortality has not improved. Aortic valve infective endocarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of infective endocarditis with a particular emphasis on aortic valve endocarditis. The term native valve endocarditis denotes a cardiac infection that involves the leaflets of the valves, the endocardial surface, chordae tendinae, congenital defects, and anastomosis sites. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined by an infection involving artificial valves, conduits, catheters, assist devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, or other artificial intracardiac structures."

Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined by an infection involving artificial valves, conduits, catheters, assist devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, or other artificial intracardiac structures. Etiology\nThe etiology of infective endocarditis has its basis on whether the valve is native or prosthetic and for prosthetic valve endocarditis, the etiology is dependent upon the timing with the early phase defined as less than two months and the late phase defined as greater than 12 months. The native valve infective endocarditis is most commonly caused by _Streptococcus viridans_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. For the early phase, prosthetic valve endocarditis causative agents include coagulase-negative staphylococci (_Staphylococcus epidermidis_) and _Staphylococcus aureus_ whereas for the late phase the key culprits include _Streptococcus viridans_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. Enterococci enter the bloodstream as a consequence of gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts manipulation. _Streptococcus bovis_ and _Clostridium_ _septicum_ are associated with colonic malignancies whereas HACEK group agents (_Haemophilus_ , _Aggregatibacter_ (previously _Actinobacillus_), _Cardiobacterium_ , _Eikenella_ , _Kingella_) infect patients with poor dental hygiene or from needle contaminate with saliva in intravenous drug users. Fungal endocarditis is the gravest form of infective endocarditis, and the risk factors include prosthetic heart valves, intravenous drug use, and an immunocompromised state."

Evaluation\nThe Modified Duke Criteria are applicable in the evaluation of patients suspected of infective endocarditis. Three categories include definite infective endocarditis, possible infective endocarditis, or rejected infective endocarditis. Definite infective endocarditis further subclassifies into\\[7\\]:\n- Definite infective endocarditis by pathological criteria: where microorganisms are present on culture or histologic examination of the vegetation, embolized vegetation or an intracardiac abscess, or pathological lesions demonstrating active endocarditis\n- Definite infective endocarditis by clinical criteria: defined by the presence of two major criteria, one major criterion plus three minor criteria, or five minor criteria in The Modified Duke Criteria\nMajor clinical criteria are defined as follows\\[5\\]:\n- Multiple positive blood cultures, single positive culture for _Coxiella burnetii_ or antiphase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1 to 800\n- Endocardial involvement (presence of new valvular regurgitation)\n- Presence of vegetation, abscess, or dehiscence (worsening or a change of pre-existing murmur does not meet criteria)\nMinor clinical criteria are as follows\\[5\\]:\n- Predisposing heart condition or use of intravenous drug use\n- Fever with body temperature greater than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F)\n- Vascular phenomena: arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesion\n- Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, rheumatoid factor, and\n- Positive blood culture that does not meet the major criteria\nPossible infective endocarditis criteria are when there are one major criterion and one minor criterion or three minor criteria present. Rejected infective endocarditis is defined when there is likely an alternative diagnosis, or there is no pathological evidence of IE with fewer than 4 days of antibiotic therapy or there is the resolution of clinical symptoms with fewer than 4 days of antibiotic therapy."

Treatment / Management\nThe American Heart Association published its updated guidelines for infective endocarditis in 2015. In those guidelines, specific recommendations are for the following\\[8\\]:\n- Native valve highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mcg/ml) viridans group streptococci (VGS) infective endocarditis\n- VGS and _S. gallolyticus_ (_bovis_) with MIC greater than 0.12 to less than 0.5 mcg/ml\n- A defective and Granulicatella species, and VGS with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 0.5 mcg/ml\n- VGS or _S. gallolyticus_ involving prosthetic material\n- Staphylococci, Staphylococci involving prosthetic material\n- Enterococci, HACEK micro-organisms\n- Non-HACEK gram-negative bacilli, culture-negative endocarditis, and fungi\nRecommendations for antimicrobial therapy, according to the causative pathogen are complex and well summarized in the 2015 American Heart Association practice guidelines. Treatment for left-sided infective endocarditis (aortic and mitral) is similar, and the recommendations are based on the pathogen, its susceptibility, timeline (acute vs. subacute), and whether it is native or prosthetic valve infective endocarditis. Generally speaking, for subacute native valve infective endocarditis, _S. viridans_ and _enterococci_ need to be covered, and the usual treatment involves IV penicillin (2.4 g, every 4 hours) for up to 4 weeks with gentamicin (1 mg/kg, every 12 hours) for 2 weeks (for suspected aminoglycoside-susceptible enterococci). Adjunctive therapy with aminoglycosides for native valve infective endocarditis is not recommended because of the risk of renal toxicity and because it doesn\u2019t decrease mortality. Likewise, rifampin is not recommended because of the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, if the culprit is aminoglycoside-susceptible enterococci, then gentamicin can be added to the regimen. Additionally, for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, the combination therapy of vancomycin and aminoglycoside or rifampin is acceptable."

Additionally, for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, the combination therapy of vancomycin and aminoglycoside or rifampin is acceptable. For acute native valve, infective endocarditis treatment _S. aureus_ needs to be covered. The treatment includes nafcillin for methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA) or cefazolin if patients are allergic to nafcillin. For methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), vancomycin is the recommended antibiotic. The alternative is daptomycin, which requires closer monitoring for dosing. _Candida_ and _Aspergillus_ may respond to medical therapy 5-fluorouracil and amphotericin B respectively, however, these patients frequently require surgical therapy. Among patients with mechanical valve endocarditis who have experienced a central nervous system embolic event, it is reasonable to discontinue for 2 weeks all forms of anticoagulation. If medical therapy fails, surgical intervention is often necessary. Class I indications for surgery in patients with infective endocarditis include valvular dysfunction with symptoms of congestive heart failure, left-sided infective endocarditis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ , fungal, or other highly resistant microorganisms, infective endocarditis with conduction defects or heart block, annular or aortic abscess, persistent infection 5 to 7 days after initiation of antibiotic therapy . For native valve endocarditis, eradication of the infected valvular tissue with subsequent valve repair or replacement is the primary therapy. Indications for Surgery\n- CHF that is refractory to treatment\n- Fungal endocarditis\n- Recurrent septic emboli despite antibiotic treatment\n- Persistent sepsis despite antibiotic treatment\n- Rupture sinus of Valsalva aneurysm\n- Conduction defect due to a septal abscess\nThere are several options for treating aortic valve endocarditis depending on the surgeon's experience and preferences. In the past, cryopreserved homografts were often utilized and had good outcomes. But these homografts have fallen out of favor because of recalcification and the need for another surgery. In addition, the implantation of a homograft does require skill. Today, aortic valve endocarditis is managed with the use of biological stentless valves. These valves have a long shelf life and are available in many sizes. However, they still require some technical skills to get the best outcomes."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAortic valve infective endocarditis is a life-threatening condition with a poor prognosis. Despite technological advances over the past few decades, mortality remains high. Early recognition and prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy can help optimize patient outcomes. an interprofessional approach involves physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. It is vital that pharmacists, nurses, physician assistants, and primary care clinicians be aware of the latest guidelines for the prevention of subacute bacterial endocarditis. At least 25% of cases are a consequence of an invasive procedure that causes bacteremia. This antibiotic prophylaxis is vital in some patients. In addition, the patient has to be educated about maintaining good oral hygiene. If there is any doubt about antibiotic prophylaxis, a cardiology consult should be sought. Nurses should be vigilant about central lines as they are also a cause of bacteremia. Nurses should ensure that only dedicated personnel inserts the lines under strict aseptic guidelines. When the line is not being used, it should be removed. The nurse should work with the clinical team in treating patients with endocarditis, monitoring the patients, and contacting the clinician if unexpected fever spikes occur. The pharmacist should assist the clinical team with antibiotic selection and evaluate the patient for potential drug-drug interactions or allergies that may affect treatment. The clinicians, pharmacists, PAs, and nurses should work together to coordinate patient and family education."

Usually, staphylococcal endocarditis is more common in patients with an unremarkable history of heart disease. A recent dental procedure should prompt suspicions of viridans group streptococcal infection. _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ or _Serratia marcescens_ are seen commonly in intravenous drug users. Fungal organisms can be an issue during open-heart surgery. In the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter, a coagulase-negative staphylococcus is frequently found as the causative agent.\nNative valve endocarditis:\n- Chiefly involves the mitral valve, followed by the aortic valve\n- Congenital heart disease or any defect with high flow tension is susceptible\n- Mitral valve prolapse accounts for about 20% of cases\n- Degenerative heart disease such as the bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, or syphilis.\nProsthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)\n- Early PVE is caused by S aureus and S epidermidis, including MRSA\n- Streptococci usually cause late PVE\nIntravenous drug abuse Infective endocarditis:\n- usually presents with a new murmur and/or pleuritic chest pain\n- S.aureus is the most common cause, but MRSA rates are increasing\n- Gram-negative organisms are rarely involved\nRisk factors\n- Residual valve injury\n- Diabetes\n- Use of steroids\n- Advanced age\n- Pacemaker intervention"

On the other hand, the onset can be acute and severe with high, intermittent fever. Associated symptoms are often nonspecific and include fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\nThe presence of a new heart murmur or sounds of changing heart murmur is associated with heart failure. Splenomegaly, Roth spots, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhage, Osler nodes and petechial are frequently seen. Neurologic manifestations of meningismus, increased intracranial pressure, altered sensorium, focal neurologic signs, embolic strokes, cerebral abscesses, mycotic aneurysm, and hemorrhage are associated with the staphylococcal disease. Besides neurologic manifestation, staphylococcal disease can present complications like myocardial abscesses and may injure the cardiac conducting system producing heart block, or an abscess may rupture into the pericardium and cause purulent pericarditis.\nThe classic skin manifestation of Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages usually develop late in the course of the disease. The appearance of these lesions signifies the vasculitis caused by circulating antigen-antibody complexes.\nRecognition of infective endocarditis is based on a high suspicion of infection in a child with an underlying risk factor."

Recognition of infective endocarditis is based on a high suspicion of infection in a child with an underlying risk factor. Evaluation\nBlood specimens should be attained as early as possible, even if the child has a mild illness with no significant physical findings. Three to 5 separate blood cultures should be collected after cautious preparation of the phlebotomy site. Contamination represents an issue when results come back positive for skin bacteria. Since bacteremia remains constant, the timing for collection is irrelevant. In approximately 90% of cases of endocarditis, the causative agent is identified from the first 2 blood cultures. Is well known that antimicrobial pretreatment can reduce the yield of blood culture to 50% to 60%. Hence, the microbiology laboratory needs to be informed that the patient recently used an antimicrobial pretreatment, so other methods can be used to identify the etiologic cause. When a patient has a contributing factor, the index of suspicion should be high. Echocardiography can be used to increase the probability of diagnosing endocarditis. Echocardiography can be useful in predicting embolic complications if lesions are found to be greater than 1 cm or fungal lesions are noted. Important to mention, the absence of vegetation des does not exclude endocarditis. Visible vegetations portend a poor prognosis. Echocardiogram predictors of embolism include:\n- Multiple vegetations\n- Vegetations more than 1 cm in diameter\n- Mobile pedunculated vegetations\n- Noncalcified vegetations\n- Vegetations that are prolapsing\nThe Duke criteria aid in the diagnosis of endocarditis. The major criteria consist of positive blood cultures and evidence of endocarditis on echocardiography. The minor criteria include predisposition factors, fever, embolic-vascular signs, complex immune phenomena (glomerulonephritis, arthritis, rheumatoid factor, Osler nodes, Roth spots), single positive blood culture or serologic confirmation of infection, and echocardiographic signs not meeting the major criteria."

Treatment / Management\nWhen a definitive diagnosis is made, antibiotic therapy should begin as early as possible. The choice of antibiotics, a method of administration, and length of treatment should be synchronized with pediatric infectious disease and pediatric cardiology.\nFor empirical therapy, is recommended to start with vancomycin and gentamycin which will cover the most common causes including _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Enterococcus_ , and V _viridans streptococci_. Is required a total of 4 to 6 weeks of treatment to cover the period of vegetation formation, which is usually several weeks. Antibiotic therapy can be adjusted depending on the clinical status of the patient and laboratory findings regarding antibiogram. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously to achieve reliable sustained therapeutic levels.\nIf associated complications like heart failure are present, appropriate therapy including diuretics and reducing agents can aid in the treatment. Surgical intervention for infective endocarditis is recommended in cases of the severe aortic valve, mitral valve or prosthetic valve involvement with intractable heart failure.\nFungal endocarditis is challenging to manage. Is usually seen in severely immunosuppressed patients who have had cardiac surgery. For these cases, the recommendation is amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. In some cases, surgery may be attempted to remove the vegetation.\nThe role of anticoagulation is controversial as studies show worse outcomes in these patients.\nIndications for surgery:\n- Fungal endocarditis except for H capsulatum\n- CHF that does not respond to medical treatment\n- Persistent sepsis despite antibiotic therapy\n- Conduction disturbance caused by aortic root involvement\n- Recurrent septic emboli\n- Kissing infection between the aortic and mitral valve"

Endocarditis has very high morbidity and while the treatment does work, the key today is to try and prevent it in the first place. When patients present, clinicians should:\n- Consider endocarditis in a patient with a history of IV drug abuse\n- Do not administer antibiotics to a febrile patient without first obtaining a minimum of 2 sets of blood cultures\n- When appropriate provide antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery and dental procedures.\n- If the patient is bacteremic, avoid central lines. If there is no other option, the administer bactericidal agents at the same time.\nThe key is to make a prompt diagnosis and start antibiotic treatment. Patients should get serial echos to determine if the treatment is working and assess the valve function. In some cases, valve replacement may be required. The nurse practitioner and pharmacist must be aware of conditions that need antibiotic prophylaxis prior to any surgery or dental procedure. Further, patients need to be told to stop IV drug abuse. The interprofessional team should follow every patient with endocarditis to ensure that optimal care is provided.\n**Outcomes**\nEven with optimal treatment, endocarditis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers should be aware of new endocarditis prophylactic guidelines."
