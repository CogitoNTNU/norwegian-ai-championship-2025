    "text": "Etiology\nThe exact etiology of placental abruption is unknown. However, many factors are associated with its occurrence. Risk factors can be thought of in 3 groups: health history, including behaviors, past obstetrical events, current pregnancy, and unexpected trauma. Factors that can be identified during the health history that increase the risk of placental abruption include smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age over 35 years, hypertension, and placental abruption in a prior pregnancy. Conditions specific to the current pregnancy that may precipitate placental abruption are multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Finally, trauma to the abdomen, such as a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence resulting in a blow to the abdomen, may lead to placental abruption.\nPlacental abruption occurs when there is a compromise of the vascular structures supporting the placenta. In other words, the vascular networks connecting the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta are torn away. These vascular structures deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of the vascular network may occur when the vascular structures are compromised because of hypertension or substance use or by conditions that cause stretching of the uterus. The uterus is a muscle and is elastic, whereas the placenta is less elastic than the uterus. Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away."

Therefore, when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly, the placenta remains stable, and the vascular structure connecting the uterine wall to the placenta tears away. Pathophysiology\nPlacental abruption occurs when the maternal vessels tear away from the placenta, and bleeding occurs between the uterine lining and the maternal side of the placenta. As the blood accumulates, it pushes the uterine wall and placenta apart. The placenta is the fetus\u2019 source of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the way the fetus excretes waste products. Diffusion to and from the maternal circulatory system is essential to maintaining these life-sustaining functions of the placenta. When accumulating blood causes separation of the placenta from the maternal vascular network, these vital functions of the placenta are interrupted. If the fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, it dies. The clinical implications of a placental abruption vary based on the extent and location of the separation. Placental abruption can be complete or partial and marginal or central. The classification of placental abruption is based on the following clinical findings:\n**Class 0: Asymptomatic**\n- Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta\n- Diagnosis is made retrospectively\n**Class 1: Mild**\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding or a small amount of vaginal bleeding. - Slight uterine tenderness\n- Maternal blood pressure and heart rate WNL\n- No signs of fetal distress\n**Class 2: Moderate**\n- No sign of vaginal bleeding to a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding\n- Significant uterine tenderness with tetanic contractions\n- Change in vital signs: maternal tachycardia, orthostatic changes in blood pressure."

History and Physical\nPlacental abruption is 1 of the causes of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. A focused history and physical is critical to differentiate placental abruption and other causes of vaginal bleeding. Because a definitive diagnosis of placental abruption can only be made after birth when the placenta is examined, the history and physical examination are critical to the appropriate management of the maternal/fetal dyad. Placental abruption is a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, accurate patient assessment is critical to developing an appropriate management plan and preventing a potentially poor outcome. The history begins with a review of the prenatal course, especially placental location on prior sonograms and if there is a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Exploring the woman\u2019s behaviors, specifically whether she smokes or uses cocaine, is a critical component of history. Asking about potential trauma, especially in the abdominal area, needs to be tactful and supportive. Especially in situations of partner abuse, the woman may be reluctant to reveal that she sustained trauma to her abdomen. The most useful mechanism for recognizing the onset of placental abruption is an assessment of the patient. The physical examination includes palpation of the uterus. If present, the uterus is palpated for tenderness, consistency, and frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The vaginal area is inspected for the presence of bleeding. However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa."

However, a digital examination of the cervix should be delayed until a sonogram is obtained for placental location and to rule out a placenta previa. Evaluation\nThere are no laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures to diagnose placental abruption definitively. However, some studies may be conducted to eliminate other conditions and provide baseline data.\nAn ultrasound examination is useful in determining the placental location and eliminating the diagnosis of placenta previa. However, ultrasound's sensitivity in visualizing placental abruption is low. During the acute phase of placental abruption, the hemorrhage is isoechoic or similar to the surrounding placental tissue. Therefore, visualization and differentiation of the concealed hemorrhage associated with placental abruption from the surrounding placental tissue are difficult.\nA biophysical profile may be used to manage conservatively treated patients with marginal placental abruption. A score of 6 or below indicates compromised fetal status.\nBlood work, including a CBC, clotting studies (fibrinogen and PT/a-PTT), and BUN, provides baseline parameters to evaluate patient status changes. If a blood transfusion is necessary, a type and Rh have been obtained.\nA Kleihauer-Betke test may be ordered to detect fetal blood cells in maternal circulation. This test does not diagnose the presence of placental abruption but quantifies the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation. This knowledge is important in Rh-negative women because the mixing of fetal blood in the maternal circulation may lead to isoimmunization. Therefore, if a significant fetal-maternal bleed is present, the Kleihauer-Betke test results help to determine the needed dose of Rh (D) immune globulin to prevent isoimmunization."

Treatment / Management\nThe onset of placental abruption is often unexpected, sudden, and intense and requires immediate treatment. Prehospital care for a patient with a suspected placental abruption requires advanced life support and transport to a hospital with a full-service obstetrical unit and a neonatal intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the hospital, most women receive intravenous (IV) fluids, supplemental oxygen, and continuous maternal and fetal monitoring while the history and physical are completed. Subsequent treatment varies based on the data collected during the assessment, the gestation of the pregnancy, and the degree of distress experienced by the woman or the fetus. Women classified with a class 1 or mild placental abruption, no signs of maternal or fetal distress, and pregnancy less than 37 weeks gestation may be managed conservatively. These patients are usually admitted to the obstetrical unit for close maternal and fetus status monitoring. Intravenous access and blood work for type and cross-match are part of the plan of care. The maternal-fetal dyad continues to be monitored until there is a change in condition or fetal maturity. Delivery is necessary if the collected data results in class 2 (moderate) or class 3 (severe) classification and the fetus is viable and alive. Because of the hypertonic contractions, a vaginal birth may occur rapidly. Given the potential for coagulopathy, vaginal birth presents less risk to the mother. However, if there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean birth is necessary to protect the fetus. Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure."

Careful management of fluids and circulatory volume is important during the surgical procedure. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nPlacental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including an obstetrician, radiologist, hematologist, obstetric nurse, and intensivist. The triage nurse should know this condition and immediately admit and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, the obstetrician should be called ASAP. Immediate transfer to an ICU setting is highly recommended, and blood should be crossed and typed in case needed. Placental abruption is a true obstetric emergency and requires collaboration between the anesthesiologist and the radiologist. Operating room nurses should be informed of the patient so that the room can be prepared. In case the fetus is premature, the neonatal ICU team should be notified. Only with a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of this disorder be lowered. While the condition cannot be prevented, the patient must be encouraged to stop smoking to lower the risk. Another major risk factor is the abuse of cocaine, which must be curtailed. Some patients may benefit from drug counseling and or drug rehabilitation. **Outcomes**\nPlacental abruption is a life-threatening disorder for both the mother and the fetus. If the bleeding is not arrested, then the lives of the mother and fetus are in jeopardy. If there is complete or near separation of the placenta, death is inevitable unless an immediate cesarean section is performed. Fetal mortality rates of 1-40% have been reported, but this also depends on the age of the fetus and the extent of separation. Each year in the US, about 1 to 5% of maternal deaths are linked to placental abruption."
