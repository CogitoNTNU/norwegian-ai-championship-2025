    "text": "Evaluation\nThe diagnosis of ARDS is based on the following criteria: acute onset, bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiography or CT scan (who are of non-cardiac origin), and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg. It is further sub-classified into mild (PaO2/FiO2 >200 mm Hg, but \u2264300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO2/FiO2 >100 mm Hg, but \u2264 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264100 mm Hg) subtypes. Mortality and ventilator-free days increase with severity. A CT scan of the chest may be helpful in cases of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, or barotrauma to correctly identify infiltrates as pulmonic in origin.\nAssessing left ventricular function is crucial to differentiate ARDS from congestive heart failure or to understand heart failure's contribution to the patient's condition. This assessment can be done through invasive methods like pulmonary artery catheter measurements or noninvasive techniques such as cardiac echocardiography, thoracic bioimpedance, or pulse contour analysis. However, using pulmonary artery catheters is controversial and generally discouraged, with a preference for noninvasive methods. Bronchoscopy may be required to assess pulmonary infections and obtain material for culture.\nFurther laboratory and radiographic tests are guided by the underlying cause of the inflammatory process leading to ARDS. Patients with ARDS often develop or have concurrent multi-organ failure, affecting renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic systems. Regular testing, including complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum magnesium, serum ionized calcium, phosphorus levels, blood lactate level, coagulation panel, troponin, cardiac enzymes, and CKMB, is recommended as clinically indicated."

Regular testing, including complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum magnesium, serum ionized calcium, phosphorus levels, blood lactate level, coagulation panel, troponin, cardiac enzymes, and CKMB, is recommended as clinically indicated. Treatment / Management\nThe chief treatment strategy is supportive care, focusing on 1) reducing shunt fraction, 2) increasing oxygen delivery, 3) decreasing oxygen consumption, and 4) avoiding further injury. Patients are mechanically ventilated, guarded against fluid overload with diuretics, and given nutritional support until improvement is observed. Interestingly, the mode in which a patient is ventilated affects lung recovery. Evidence suggests that some ventilatory strategies can exacerbate alveolar damage and perpetuate lung injury in the context of ARDS. Care is placed on preventing volutrauma (exposure to large tidal volumes), barotrauma (exposure to high plateau pressures), and atelectrauma (exposure to atelectasis). A lung-protective ventilatory strategy is advocated to reduce lung injury. The NIH-NHLBI ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation Protocol (ARDSnet) sets the following goals: tidal volume (TV) from 4 to 8 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), respiratory rate (RR) up to 35 bpm, SpO2 88% to 95%, plateau pressure (Pp) less than 30 cm H2O, pH goal 7.30 to 7.45, and inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio less than 1. To maintain oxygenation, ARDSnet recognizes the benefit of PEEP. The protocol allows for a low or a high PEEP strategy relative to FiO2. Either strategy tolerates a PEEP of up to 24 cm H2O in patients requiring 100% FiO2. The inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio goal may need to be sacrificed, and an inverse inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio strategy may need to be instituted to improve oxygenation in particular clinical situations. Novel invasive ventilation strategies have been developed to improve oxygenation. These include airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and high-frequency oscillation ventilation (children)."

Novel invasive ventilation strategies have been developed to improve oxygenation. These include airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and high-frequency oscillation ventilation (children). Recruitment maneuvers and APRV have not been shown to improve mortality but may improve oxygenation. Patients with mild and some with moderate ARDS may benefit from non-invasive ventilation to avoid endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. These modalities include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bi-level airway pressure (BiPAP), proportional-assist ventilation, and a high-flow nasal cannula. Adequate care should be taken to intubate and mechanically ventilate these patients if they get worse on the above non-invasive ventilation. Several strategies can be employed to reduce the risk of barotrauma in ARDS management to achieve Pp less than 30 cm H2O. One effective approach involves maintaining TV and minimizing PEEP as much as possible. Additionally, increasing the rise or inspiration time can aid in meeting the Pp target. Decreasing the flow rate can also serve as a supplementary method to lower Pp. Improving lung compliance will improve Pp and oxygenation goal attainment. Neuromuscular blockade has been used as an aid to improving compliance. Neuromuscular blockers instituted during the first 48 hours of ARDS improved 90-day survival and increased time off the ventilator. However, the most recent trial published in 2019 showed no significant difference in mortality with continuous infusion of people with paralysis compared to lighter sedation goals. Other causes of decreased lung compliance should be sought and addressed. These include but are not limited to pneumothorax, hemothorax, thoracic compartment syndrome, and intraabdominal hypertension. Prone position has shown benefits in about 50% to 70% of patients. The improvement in oxygenation is rapid and allows a reduction in FiO2 and PEEP. The prone position is safe, but there is a risk of dislodgement of lines and tubes. The prone position is believed to facilitate the recruitment of dependent lung zones, improve diaphragmatic excursion, and increase functional residual capacity. The patient must be prone for at least 8 hours a day to derive the benefits."

The prone position is believed to facilitate the recruitment of dependent lung zones, improve diaphragmatic excursion, and increase functional residual capacity. The patient must be prone for at least 8 hours a day to derive the benefits. Nonventilatory strategies have included prone positioning and conservative fluid management once resuscitation has been achieved. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has recently been advocated as salvage therapy in refractory hypoxemic ARDS. However, two major trials that compared venovenous ECMO to standard care showed no difference in mortality between the two groups. Nutritional support via enteral feeding is recommended. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet containing gamma-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid has been shown in some studies to improve oxygenation. A moderately permissive hyperglycemic strategy, blood glucose 140 to 180 mg/dL, is recommended for most hyperglycemic critically ill patients, rather than intensive insulin therapy targeting blood glucose 80 to 110 mg/dL. Critically ill patients are more prone to deep venous thrombosis, so some form of prophylaxis is recommended. Likewise, prophylaxis against stress ulcers is advised for increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Glucocorticoids can be administered in patients in whom ARDS has been precipitated by a steroid-responsive process (eg, acute eosinophilic pneumonia) and to those with refractory sepsis or community-acquired pneumonia. Most patients who have persistent or refractory moderate to severe ARDS are relatively early in the disease course (within 14 days of onset with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio \\<200 mm Hg) despite initial management with standard therapies, including low tidal volume ventilation, can also be managed with glucocorticoids. However, glucocorticoids are generally avoided in patients with less severe ARDS or those with persistent ARDS beyond 14 days. Moreover, their use is associated with worse outcomes in patients with certain viral infections, including influenza. Central venous catheters may be helpful for frequent blood draws, administration of vasopressors, and measurement of central venous pressure. Care must also be taken to prevent pressure sores. Frequent patient repositioning or turning is recommended when feasible. Skin checks per nursing routine are also advised. Physical therapy should involve exercising the patient when they are weaned from mechanical ventilation and stable to participate in treatment."

Physical therapy should involve exercising the patient when they are weaned from mechanical ventilation and stable to participate in treatment. Prognosis\nThe prognosis for ARDS was abysmal until very recently. There are reports of 30% to 40% mortality up until the 1990s, but over the past 20 years, there has been a significant decrease in the mortality rate, even for severe ARDS. These accomplishments are secondary to a better understanding of and advancements in mechanical ventilation and earlier antibiotic administration and selection. The primary cause of death in patients with ARDS was sepsis or multiorgan failure. While mortality rates are now around 9% to 20%, it is much higher in older patients. ARDS has significant morbidity as these patients remain in the hospital for extended periods and have significant weight loss, poor muscle function, and functional impairment. Hypoxia from the inciting illness also leads to various cognitive changes that may persist for months after discharge. As measured by functional testing, there is an almost near-complete return of pulmonary capacity for many survivors. Nonetheless, many patients report feelings of dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance. This ARDS sequela makes returning to a normal life challenging for these patients as they adjust to a new baseline."

Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care\n**Tracheostomy and**Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy\nMany patients with ARDS require a tracheostomy and a percutaneous feeding tube (PEG) in the recovery phase. The tracheostomy facilitates weaning from the ventilator, making it easy to clear the secretions and more comfortable. The tracheostomy is usually performed at 2 to 3 weeks, followed by a PEG.\n**Nutritional Support**\nMost patients with ARDS have difficulty eating, and muscle wasting is very common. These patients are either given enteral or parenteral feeding, depending on the condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Some experts recommend a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet as it has anti-inflammatory and vasodilating effects. Almost every type of nutritional supplement has been studied in patients with ARDS, but none has proven to be the magic bullet.\n**Activity**\nSince patients with ARDS are bed-bound, frequent position changes are highly recommended to prevent bedsores and deep venous thrombosis. One can minimize the sedation in alert patients and sit them in a chair."

Patients with ARDS may require mechanical ventilation because of hypoxia. The management is usually in the ICU with an interprofessional healthcare team. ARDS has effects beyond the lung. Prolonged mechanical ventilation often leads to bedsores, deep venous thrombosis, multisystem organ failure, weight loss, and poor overall functioning. It is essential to have an integrated approach to ARDS management because it usually affects many organs in the body. These patients need nutritional support, chest physiotherapy, treatment for sepsis if present, and potentially hemodialysis. Many of these patients remain in the hospital for months, and even those who survive face severe challenges due to a loss of muscle mass and cognitive changes (due to hypoxia). Evidence shows that an interprofessional team approach improves outcomes by facilitating communication and ensuring timely intervention. The team and responsibilities should consist of the following:\n- Intensivist: Manages ventilator use and ICU issues like pneumonia prevention and DVT prophylaxis. - Dietitian and Nutritionist: Provide nutritional support. - Respiratory Therapist: Oversees ventilator settings. - Pharmacist: Manages medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics. - Pulmonologist: Addresses lung diseases. - Nephrologist: Manages kidney health and renal replacement therapy. - Nurses: Monitor patient health, assist with movement, and educate families. - Physical Therapist: Aids in regaining muscle function. - Tracheostomy Nurse: Helps with tracheostomy maintenance and weaning. - Mental Health Nurse: Assesses psychological well-being. - Social Worker: Manages rehabilitation transfers, follow-up care, and any financial issues the patient may have. - Chaplain: Provides spiritual support. **Outcomes**\nDespite advances in critical care, ARDS still has high morbidity and mortality. Even those who survive can have a poorer quality of life."
