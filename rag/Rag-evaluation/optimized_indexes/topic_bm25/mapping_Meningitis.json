Symptoms typically include fever, neck pain/stiffness, and photophobia. More non-specific symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium, irritability, and nausea/vomiting. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and seizures) portend a poor prognosis.\nThe following risk factors should increase clinical suspicion:\n- Close contact exposures (military barracks, college dorms)\n- Incomplete vaccinations\n- Immunosuppression\n- Children younger than five years and adults older than 65 years\n- Alcohol use disorder\nOne should try to determine a history of exposures, sexual contact, animal contact, previous neurosurgical intervention, recent travel, and the season. Most viral cases tend to occur in the warmer months.\nIn adults, the physical exam is centered on identifying focal neurologic deficits, meningeal irritation (Brudzinski and Kernig signs), and particularly in meningococcal meningitis, characteristic skin lesions (petechiae and purpura). Cranial nerve abnormalities are seen in 10%-20% of patients.\nSigns and symptoms are less evident in neonates and infants. They can present with and without fever or hypothermia, decreased oral intake, altered mental status, irritability, bulging fontanelle. It is important to obtain a full perinatal history and vaccine records. Some causes of meningitis are vaccine-preventable such as Pneumococcus, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B, Meningococcus, Measles, and Varicella-virus."

Evaluation\nMeningitis is diagnosed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which includes white blood cell count, glucose, protein, culture, and in some cases, polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CSF is obtained via a lumbar puncture (LP), and the opening pressure can be measured. Additional testing should be performed tailored on suspected etiology:\n- Viral: Multiplex and specific PCRs\n- Fungal: CSF fungal culture, India ink stain for _Cryptococcus_\n- Mycobacterial: CSF Acid-fast bacilli smear and culture\n- Syphilis: CSF VDRL\n- Lyme disease: CSF _burgdorferi_ antibody\nThe CSF findings expected in bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis are listed in the chart: Expected CSF findings in bacterial versus viral versus fungal meningitis. Ideally, the CSF sample should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials. However, when the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is seriously considered, and the patient is severely ill, antibiotics should be initiated before performing the LP. **Computed Tomography (CT) of the Head before Lumbar Puncture**\nThere is controversy regarding the adage that the lumbar puncture is the inciting event causing brain herniation and death in the setting of increased intracranial pressure caused by acute bacterial meningitis. Currently, guidelines recommend empiric antibiotics and supportive care, while forgoing the lumbar puncture if there is clinical suspicion of increased intracranial pressure or impending brain herniation. Signs and symptoms of impending herniation include:\n- Glasgow coma scale (GCS) less than 11\n- Lethargy\n- Altered mental status\n- New-onset seizures\n- Focal neurologic deficit\nIt is important to note that a normal head CT does not preclude increased intracranial pressure or impending brain herniation."

The majority of patients with meningitis first present to the emergency department and a streamlined interprofessional approach is vital if one wants to lower the high morbidity. The triage nurse must be fully aware of the signs and symptoms of the illness and refer the patient immediately to the emergency department clinician. Other specialists who are usually involved in the care of these patients are neurologists, pediatricians, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and pharmacists. If bacterial meningitis is suspected, prompt antibiotics should be started even in the absence of laboratory results. The pharmacist, preferably specializing in infectious diseases, should assist the clinical team in choosing the appropriate antibiotics based on the age of the patient and local sensitivities and correct dosing to ensure penetration into the central nervous system.\nTo prevent this infection, the education of the public is vital. All healthcare workers (nurses, physicians, and pharmacists) should educate patients and parents in regards to vaccine-preventable meningitis (_H. influenzae_ type B, _S. pneumoniae_ , _N. meningitidis_ , Measles, and Varicella). Across the board, the incidence of meningitis has decreased with the implementation of generalized vaccination. Family members should be educated about the need for prophylaxis when there is a family member with _Neisseria_ and _H. influenzae_ type B meningitis. All contacts should be educated about the signs and symptoms of the infection and when to return to the emergency department."

Introduction\nAseptic meningitis is a term used to describe inflammation of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, caused by various factors and characterized by negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial cultures. This condition is typically diagnosed based on CSF pleocytosis, indicated by an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 5 cells/mm3. Aseptic meningitis is a prevalent and generally benign inflammatory disorder affecting the meninges.\nViruses, such as herpes simplex \\_\\_ virus type 2 (HSV-2), enteroviruses, and arboviruses are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis. However, aseptic meningitis can also be triggered by diverse factors, including infections caused by mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes, parameningeal infections, medications, and malignancies. Notably, aseptic and viral meningitis are not interchangeable, highlighting the wide array of potential causes. The clinical manifestations of aseptic meningitis can vary significantly based on the affected individual's underlying cause and immune status. Patients with deficient humoral immunity, including neonates and individuals with agammaglobulinemia, are particularly at risk for negative outcomes in cases of aseptic meningitis."

Patients with deficient humoral immunity, including neonates and individuals with agammaglobulinemia, are particularly at risk for negative outcomes in cases of aseptic meningitis. Etiology\nThe causes of aseptic meningitis can be broadly classified into infectious and noninfectious origins. Despite progress in diagnostic methods, only 30% to 65% of cases reveal a precise cause. Cases without identified causes are termed idiopathic. Infectious causes of aseptic meningitis include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, with viruses being the predominant agents. Among viral causes, enteroviruses (such as coxsackie and enteric cytopathic human orphan [ECHO] viruses) account for over half of the cases, followed by HSV-2, West Nile virus, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Other viruses associated with aseptic meningitis include respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus), mumps virus, arbovirus, HIV, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections leading to aseptic meningitis are less common than viral infections. Bacterial causes may arise from partially treated meningitis, parameningeal infections (such as epidural abscess and mastoiditis), _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , endocarditis, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , _Treponema pallidum,_ and leptospirosis. Fungal infections can be attributed to _Candida_ , _Cryptococcus neoformans_ , _Histoplasma capsulatum_ , _Coccidioides immitis_ , and _Blastomyces dermatitides_. Parasitic causes of aseptic meningitis include _Toxoplasma gondii_ , naegleria, neurocysticercosis, trichinosis, and _Hartmannella_. Regarding the noninfectious causes of aseptic meningitis, these etiologies can be categorized into 3 main groups:\n- Systemic diseases involving meningeal inflammation, such as sarcoidosis, Beh\u00e7et disease, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n- Drug-induced aseptic meningitis is most commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (sulfamides, penicillins), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and monoclonal antibodies\n- Neoplastic meningitis is linked to either metastasis from solid cancers or lymphoma/leukemia."

    "text": "History and Physical\nNo aspect of the clinical history possesses sufficient sensitivity or specificity to establish a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, a thorough patient history is crucial, given the broad range of potential causes. The history should encompass inquiries about exposure to sick contacts, recent travel, substance use, sexual history, preceding or concurrent infections, and recent medication use, considering the possibility of drug-induced aseptic meningitis.\nWhen assessing patients clinically, it is crucial to recognize the differences in how children and adults may manifest symptoms. Adults often report symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, stiff neck, and photophobia. Unlike bacterial meningitis, the onset may be less acute, and altered mental status is not a common presentation.\nIn contrast, children exhibit less specific symptoms, including fever, concurrent respiratory issues, rash, and irritability. Neonates and infants less than 3 months of age may display a bulging anterior fontanelle and irritability as notable signs. Specific factors like premature birth, maternal illness, elevated serum WBC count, low hemoglobin levels (\\<10.7 mg/dL), and the onset of symptoms within the first week of life necessitate a prompt and thorough evaluation and management approach in neonates.\nNuchal rigidity (with a sensitivity of 70%) and fever (sensitivity of 85%) are prevalent physical signs observed in children and adults. Kernig and Brudzinski's signs, while highly specific at 95%, have limited utility due to their low sensitivity of 5%.

Kernig and Brudzinski's signs, while highly specific at 95%, have limited utility due to their low sensitivity of 5%. Depending on the underlying cause, additional associated findings may be present. Evaluation\nIn recent years, although the cause of aseptic meningitis remains unidentified in up to two-thirds of cases, advances in diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of pathogens. Similarly, substantial progress has been achieved in detecting and diagnosing autoimmune or paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The initial assessment should involve laboratory testing to explore other potential causes of the symptoms (see **Image. ** Laboratory Evaluation for Aseptic Meningitis). This evaluation usually includes a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and testing for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) for enterovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and HSV. A lumbar puncture (LP) is essential for collecting CSF to establish a definitive diagnosis. During CSF analysis, it is crucial to assess cell count, measure glucose and protein levels, perform a gram stain, conduct cultures, and employ bacterial PCR (typically targeting _Neisseria meningitides_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , and _Haemophilus influenzae_. Specific viral PCR studies should also be selected based on the patient's clinical presentation. Other tests to consider include syphilis serology, tuberculosis (TB) testing, and serum HIV testing. Viral CSF PCR can detect enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, and arbovirus. Typical CSF findings in patients with aseptic meningitis include an opening pressure that is either normal (\\<180 mmH2O) or slightly elevated. Glucose levels are usually normal to mildly decreased, while protein levels are normal to mildly elevated (\\<200 mg/dL)."

Glucose levels are usually normal to mildly decreased, while protein levels are normal to mildly elevated (\\<200 mg/dL). The cell count ranges from 10 to 1000 cells per microliter, with an initial predominance of neutrophils (>50%) that gradually shifts toward lymphocytes (>80%) over time. For patients in the US presenting between June and September, it is advisable to test for West Nile virus IgM in the CSF or serum. Significant differences exist between adults and children in the presentation and laboratory findings. These differences often require specialized approaches in diagnosis and treatment tailored to each age group, emphasizing the importance of age-specific considerations in managing patients with aseptic meningitis. Adults typically report symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, malaise, and photophobia. They are more likely to exhibit nuchal rigidity during examinations compared to children. Fever, concurrent respiratory illness, and rash are signs and symptoms that are more commonly observed in children. Just as physical findings can differ, adult patients tend to exhibit a higher CSF WBC count and elevated CSF protein levels in the initial CSF evaluation than the pediatric population. Conversely, children often present with more CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis and higher leukocyte counts than adults. When interpreting CSF fluid results in neonates and young infants, applying age-adjusted values for leukocyte counts is crucial. In this population, up to 57% of children with aseptic meningitis exhibit a predominance of neutrophils in the CSF, emphasizing that relying solely on cell type cannot discriminate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis in children. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis, in particular, can often present with few laboratory abnormalities. Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion and thoroughly assess the patient's medical history, including all medications they might be taking and their respective dosages. While distinguishing between aseptic and bacterial meningitis can be challenging, specific tools have been developed to aid the diagnostic process. The bacterial meningitis score, with a sensitivity of 99% to 100% and a specificity of 52% to 62%, stands out as the most specific tool currently accessible."

Other laboratory findings, such as procalcitonin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and CSF lactate levels, can provide valuable insights to differentiate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis. Before conducting an LP, if there is suspicion of elevated intracranial pressure caused by a space-occupying lesion or inflammation, it is advisable to obtain a head computed tomography (CT) scan before proceeding with the LP, as recommended. A CT scan can offer an alternative diagnosis, eliminating the need for the LP. CT scans are typically unnecessary in neonates and infants with open fontanelles. For this age group, head ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality. Research has demonstrated that imaging might be safely avoided if all criteria are absent: age greater than or equal to 60, history of central nervous system disease, immunocompromised state, altered mental state, seizure within one week of presentation, and neurological deficits. These guidelines help healthcare professionals make informed decisions, ensuring appropriate and targeted use of imaging resources in patients suspected of having neurological conditions."

Treatment / Management\nEarly recognition of the likely cause of meningitis is vital for initiating treatment promptly. Initial patient stabilization is crucial, and studies have demonstrated the benefits of intravenous fluids (IV) administered over 48 hours. If bacterial meningitis is suspected, it is imperative to promptly start empiric antibiotics, ensuring broad coverage based on the most likely pathogens within specific age groups, especially in pediatric cases. Ideally, obtaining CSF fluid should precede antibiotic administration. However, initiating antibiotic therapy promptly is essential if this would cause a delay in treatment or if the patient is critically ill. Additionally, it is crucial to place the patient on droplet isolation precautions until the cause of the infection is identified. If HSV or (VZV) is suspected, intravenous acyclovir should be included in the empiric treatment regimen. If the CSF fluid results are more consistent with aseptic meningitis, discontinuing antibiotics should be considered, considering the patient's initial presentation and clinical status. Management of viral meningitis (excluding HSV and VZV) primarily involves supportive care. Specific treatments for various bacteria, fungi, and others are beyond the scope of this activity. However, as discussed earlier, these treatments should be tailored based on individual clinical presentation and underlying health conditions. Steroids are employed as adjunctive therapy to mitigate the inflammatory response. Dexamethasone, administered 10 to 20 minutes before or concurrently with antibiotics, is supported by evidence, even in cases where the etiology is initially unknown while awaiting culture results. Research has demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing short-term neurologic sequelae and hearing loss, although this benefit is more pronounced in cases of bacterial meningitis. A repeat LP is generally unnecessary but should be considered for patients whose clinical condition does not improve after 48 hours."

Differential Diagnosis\nThe signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis are frequently vague and nonspecific, leading to a broad range of possible diagnoses. Headache and fever, among the most common symptoms, significantly shape the differential diagnosis.\nBacterial meningitis is the most concerning and prevalent alternative cause and should be the default diagnosis until ruled out. Patients with the appropriate clinical presentation should also be evaluated for intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, neoplastic disorders such as leukemia and brain tumors, other types of headaches like migraines, and inflammation of brain structures such as brain abscess and epidural abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nFever originating from nearly any source can manifest with headache and neck stiffness as associated symptoms. Conditions like urinary tract infections and pneumonia may also present with headaches, body aches, and fever. Consequently, conducting a thorough investigation for infectious sources is an integral aspect of every diagnostic workup.\nSeveral causes of aseptic meningitis may exhibit most or all symptoms without actual meningeal involvement. Viral syndromes, in particular, frequently lead to symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, weakness, and fever, even without direct meningeal inflammation.\nThe wider range of differential diagnoses includes anemia, a condition known for causing headaches and weakness.

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nIn managing aseptic meningitis, a team-based approach is essential. Physicians diagnose the condition based on clinical symptoms and lab results, determining appropriate treatment strategies, medications, and hospitalization when necessary. Effective communication with patients and their families is crucial to ensure they comprehend the diagnosis, treatment plan, and expectations. In managing aseptic meningitis, the primary focus is supportive care, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate medical treatment. Specialists in fields such as infectious disease and neurology can be involved, especially in cases where the patient exhibits severe neurological symptoms and complications or requires specialized assessments. An oncologist may also be helpful if meningitis is due to malignancy. Because meningitis represents a dangerous infectious disease, communication with all levels of the staff is essential. Ensuring the proper isolation measures and using personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of the infection to the medical team or other patients is paramount and should be of primary concern. Once the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis is established and more concerning diagnoses are excluded, these precautions can be discontinued. An LP is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and can be conducted by an emergency medicine clinician, an internist on an inpatient floor, or an interventional radiologist. Laboratory proficiency is essential to analyze specimens and conduct PCR studies, aiding in identifying the most common etiology, typically viruses. Unfortunately, these studies are still underutilized. Nurses closely monitor patients, observing vital signs and neurological status, which is crucial for early detection of complications or deterioration. Pharmacists collaborate with healthcare providers to ensure appropriate dosages, interactions, and compatibility of medications prescribed for aseptic meningitis."

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis is the result of the invasion of the bacteria into the meninges from bacteremia or direct extension from local infection. The most common bacterial culprit varies by age. Group B _Streptococcus_ is common in infants less than 2 months of age while _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is the most common in all other age groups, with the exception of 11 - 17 year old, where _Neisseria meningitidis is_ still the most common cause.\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ and gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella_ , _Enterobacter_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ are other less common causes. _Hemophilus influenzae_ is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals.

As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003\u20132007, _S. pneumoniae_ was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), _N. meningitidis_ (13.9%), _H. influenzae_ (6.7%), and _L. monocytogenes_ (3.4%). Infectious meningitis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Meningitis may also be non-infectious in etiology and can be caused by cancer, medications, or inflammatory conditions."

Epidemiology\nBacterial meningitis was previously more common in pediatric patients. However, as vaccines are developed and utilized, the prevalence of acute bacterial meningitis has decreased and the epidemiology of causative microorganisms has changed. Vaccinations have increased the median age of patients infected. In 2006 there were 72,000 meningitis-related hospitalizations in the United States. The majority of these cases were due to viral infection (54.6%). Bacterial infections accounted for 21.8% of cases, and 7.3% were due to fungi and parasite infections, while 17.2% were due to an unspecified cause. There was an 8% in-hospital mortality rate for patients with bacterial meningitis, and it rose substantially for patients older than 45. The annual incidence of meningitis in the United States decreased from 2.00 cases per 100,000 population in 1998\u20131999 to 1.38 cases per 100,000 population in 2006\u20132007 while the median age of patients increased from 30.3 years in 1998\u20131999 to 41.9 years in 2006\u20132007. As per CDC data, rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States since the late 1990s. In 2017, there were about 350 total cases of meningococcal disease reported (incidence rate of 0.11 cases per 100,000 persons). Several possible risk factors for bacterial meningitis have been identified. Patients with an abnormal communication between the nasopharynx and subarachnoid space are thought to be at increased risk. This abnormal communication can be due to a congenital abnormality or a result of trauma. Patients who have undergone neurosurgery, sustained skull fractures, or have cochlear implants are also at increased risk."

This abnormal communication can be due to a congenital abnormality or a result of trauma. Patients who have undergone neurosurgery, sustained skull fractures, or have cochlear implants are also at increased risk. Pathophysiology\nBacteria require access to the meninges to cause meningitis. There are several mechanisms for entry. Bacteremia, or bacteria in the blood, can result in bacteria crossing the blood-brain barrier. This can only be accomplished by certain bacteria, most notably _N. meningitidis_ and _S. pneumoniae_. Direct extension of otitis media or sinusitis to the central nervous system (CNS) may also occur. Dural defects, either congenital or acquired, allow bacteria to enter the CNS. Nosocomial bacterial meningitis is the result of the manipulation of the meninges during neurosurgical procedures. Invasion of bacteria into the subarachnoid space results in inflammation of the meninges.\nAlthough several factors may be involved, lipopolysaccharide in the walls of gram-negative organisms and techoic acid in the walls of gram-positive microorganisms activate brain microglia, leading to a cascade of inflammatory changes that causes cortical microvascular permeability with diffuse cerebral edema, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. This causes the patient to experience headaches and fevers. Blood-brain barrier breakdown occurs secondary to the infection and inflammatory response. Altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits occur due to decreased perfusion and increased intracranial pressure."

Altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits occur due to decreased perfusion and increased intracranial pressure. History and Physical\nFever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status are the classic triad of symptoms for meningitis; however, all three are only present in 41% of cases of bacterial meningitis. The triad is most commonly seen in elderly patients. Seventy percent of patients will present with at least one of these symptoms. Common early symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and confusion which can progress to obtundation, focal neuro deficits, and seizures. History should include questioning about any recent neurosurgical procedures, immunization status, and living arrangements. A physical exam may reveal nuchal rigidity or positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's signs. However, the absence of these does not reliably rule out the disease. Brudzinski's sign occurs when passive flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee. Kernig's sign is resistance or pain with knee extension when the patient is supine, and their hip is flexed to 90 degrees. These signs are thought to be secondary to meningeal irritation. The fundoscopic exam may reveal papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure. A rapidly spreading petechial rash, known as purpura fulminans, would suggest a Meningococcal infection."

A rapidly spreading petechial rash, known as purpura fulminans, would suggest a Meningococcal infection. Evaluation\nPatients presumed to have bacterial meningitis should receive a lumbar puncture to obtain a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. The CSF should be sent for Gram stain, culture, complete cell count (CBC), and glucose and protein levels. Bacterial meningitis typically results in low glucose and high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. As CSF glucose levels are dependent on circulating serum glucose levels, the CSF to serum glucose ratio is considered more reliable parameter for the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis than absolute CSF glucose levels. A neutrophil predominance on cell count would be expected.\nThe diagnosis would be confirmed with bacteria identified on gram stain or culture. A non-contrast CT scan of the head should be performed before lumbar puncture if the patient has a risk of herniation. Risk factors include papilledema on the exam, new onset seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or is immunocompromised. Consider delaying the lumbar puncture if the patient has unstable vital signs, coagulation abnormalities, or has had a recent seizure. Treat with antibiotics empirically if testing is going to be delayed. Blood cultures should be obtained as 53% of patients have concurrent bacteremia. Elevated C-reactive protein or procalcitonin levels would suggest a bacterial rather than viral etiology."

Elevated C-reactive protein or procalcitonin levels would suggest a bacterial rather than viral etiology. Treatment / Management\nTimely administration of antibiotics is essential. Delays in the administration of 3 to 6 hours are associated with increased mortality. The identified bacteria determine antibiotic selection. Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin should strongly be considered if the diagnosis is going to be delayed. Patients who are immunocompromised or older than 50 should also receive ampicillin. Patients with bacterial meningitis due to head trauma or post-neurosurgical procedure need to be covered for methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ and aerobic gram-negative organisms. They should receive vancomycin and ceftazidime or cefepime. Acyclovir can also be administered for HSV coverage. Antibiotics can then be narrowed once the culture and sensitivities have resulted. Dexamethasone may increase survival if given at the time of antibiotic administration for _S. pneumoniae_ infections. It has not been shown to improve outcomes for meningitis caused by other bacteria. Patients suspected of having meningococcal meningitis should be placed in droplet precautions until they have received 24 hours of antibiotics. Close contacts should also be treated prophylactically. Ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone may be used. Close contacts are defined as people within 3 feet of the patient for more than 8 hours during the seven days before and 24 hours after receiving antibiotics. People exposed to the patient's oral secretions during this time should also be treated."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nBacterial meningitis is a serious CNS infection with high morbidity and mortality. To improve patient outcomes, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, emergency department physician, laboratory professional, internist, nurse practitioner, and a pediatrician. The key is to start prompt treatment without delay. One should not wait for cultures if suspicion is high of meningitis. The infectious disease specialist should consult with a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist so optimal antimicrobial therapy based on the latest antibiogram data can be initiate empirically, enhancing the chance for successful treatment. These patients need inpatient treatment until all symptoms have disappeared, therefore the nursing staff will be responsible for administration as well as monitoring for therapeutic effectiveness and adverse drug events, reporting any concerns to the team. The outlook for patients with delayed diagnosis or treatment is poor. More important, delays also lead to litigation."
