    "text": "Evaluation\nThe diagnosis of urosepsis requires both suspicion of sepsis as well as evidence of a UTI. SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) signs and symptoms are indicators of sepsis but are no longer required for the formal diagnosis. This includes abnormalities in body temperature (warm skin), heart rate (bounding pulses, tachycardia), respiratory rate, and white blood cell count (elevation or depression). In more severe forms, sepsis is diagnosed when there is evidence of organ dysfunction, including but not limited to kidney dysfunction evidenced by decreased urine output, encephalopathy with an abrupt change in mental status, or a low platelet count. The diagnosis of a complicated UTI in the setting of SIRS includes signs and symptoms (dysuria, flank pain), physical exam findings (costovertebral angle tenderness, evidence of urinary retention), radiologic features, and laboratory results showing bacteriuria and leucocyturia.\nIf urosepsis is suspected, the laboratory workup should include a urinalysis with a urine culture. Providers should also order a complete blood cell count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, blood cultures, and a lactate level to look for evidence of end-organ dysfunction. Post-renal obstruction is one of the most common causes of urosepsis. Ultrasound can identify 93% of common contributing causes of urosepsis, such as hydronephrosis or prostate abscess. However, the dependence on an experienced ultrasonographer and their availability often limit the utilization of ultrasound for such patients. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is rapidly available at all hours and is easily reproducible without a need for technologist expertise. This often makes CT scan the diagnostic modality of choice when urosepsis is suspected. It can also identify subtle radiographic findings not easily visualized with ultrasound."

This often makes CT scan the diagnostic modality of choice when urosepsis is suspected. It can also identify subtle radiographic findings not easily visualized with ultrasound. Treatment / Management\nOver the last few decades, there has been an increase in multi-drug resistant organisms causing UTIs, making treatment more complicated. This is thought to stem from the overuse of antibiotics to treat suspected UTIs as confirmation is not available for 2 to 3 days until a urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility has resulted. Research aimed at reducing mortality from sepsis via aggressive treatment modalities, including the original Rivers trial, has shown that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) reduces mortality from sepsis. While some of the original recommendations of EGDT have been challenged recently, these overall treatment guidelines remain: (1) Rapid initiation of empiric antibiotics that are chosen to eliminate the suspected source of infection, (2) Supportive care, including hemodynamic and pulmonary stabilization, and (3) Adjunctive therapies. When choosing antibiotics, the goal is to have these infused into the patient within one hour of a confirmed diagnosis, but they should be given only after urine and blood cultures have been collected. Each hour antibiotics are delayed after the initial six hours is associated with an 8% decrease in survival. Local susceptibility patterns guide antibiotic choice but often includes a third-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or a fluoroquinolone. It is important to remember in dosing these antibiotics that many patients with severe sepsis have end-organ dysfunction, including renal and liver impairment, which might affect the clearance of antibiotics. In addition to early antibiotics, there are other important parts of the management of sepsis. Initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid is still recommended at a minimum of 30 mL/kg."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nUrosepsis is best managed with an interprofessional team of health professionals that include a nephrologist, infectious disease expert, urologist, intensivist, a nurse, and a pharmacist. The key to preventing high morbidity is to prevent the condition that promotes infection. Any urological abnormality that is present needs to be corrected. The pharmacist should ensure that there is no delay in the administration of the antibiotics. The nurse should closely monitor the patient for signs of sepsis and communicate with the healthcare provider. Many of these patients require ICU care with close monitoring and frequent radiological studies.\n**Outcomes**\nThe outcomes after urosepsis depend on the cause and severity of the infection. The prognosis also depends on the type of bacteria, antimicrobial resistance, and patient comorbidity. This is where the input of a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can be very beneficial, helping select appropriate antimicrobial coverage, check for drug interactions, and verify all dosing, and report any concerns to the clinical team. If left untreated, the condition has a very high mortality. Even those who survive have a prolonged recovery period. Residual disturbance in renal function is not uncommon."

    "text": "Introduction\nBacterial sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body\u2019s response to an infection injures its tissues and organs. Sepsis has recently been re-defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis, as a medical condition, was first introduced by Hippocrates (460 through 470 BC) and is derived from the Greek word _sipsi_ , i.e., \u201cto make rotten.\u201d This disease entity has had many iterations since that time, with the foundations for the modern understanding of sepsis coming about through breakthroughs in the late 19 century. The development of antiseptic measures, the germ theory of disease, and bacteriology lead to the widely held belief that sepsis was a systemic infection resulting from a pathogenic organism invading the host that spreads via the bloodstream (i.e., septicemia). It was not until the further widespread use of antibiotics and the discovery of endotoxin that suggested the pathophysiology of sepsis was far more complex. Despite the increased understanding of this complex disease process, mortality from sepsis remains the most common cause of death in the non-coronary intensive care unit. In the hopes of allowing earlier therapeutic intervention, an international consensus meeting in 1991 created and defined terms, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (known now as Sepsis-1). SIRS describes the inflammatory process, independent of cause, based on a combination of vital signs and blood work."

Sepsis-3 redefined sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is important to note that not all patients that present with SIRS have an infection, as well not all patients who have an infection are septic. Sepsis is differentiated from infection by a dysregulated host response and the presence of end-organ dysfunction. Sepsis and its sequelae represent a continuum of clinical and pathophysiologic severity, resulting in progressive physiologic failure of several inter-dependent organ systems. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and its accompanying treatment bundle were developed with the intention of rapid identification and treatment of septic patients. In 2001, Rivers et al. showed the benefits of a specific protocol termed early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) versus standard therapy, with a resulting significant decrease in mortality. EGDT was subsequently incorporated into the first iteration of the 6hr resuscitation bundle of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. These guidelines have changed since their first publication, with revisions in 2008, 2012, and finally, 2016."

These guidelines have changed since their first publication, with revisions in 2008, 2012, and finally, 2016. Etiology\nThe inflammatory response that leads to clinical syndromes such as sepsis is triggered by conditions that threaten the functional integrity of the host, in this case, microbial invasion. Both pro-inflammatory responses and anti-inflammatory responses characterize the host response. The extent of this process depends entirely on both pathogen factors (load, virulence, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern) and host factors (environment, genetics, age, other illnesses, and medications). At its onset, the host cell will recognize the pathogen leading to a perpetuation of inflammation starting with leukocyte activation, then complement activation and coagulation activation, ultimately resulting in necrotic cell death. Normally, leukocyte activation, primarily neutrophils, are activated early in the inflammatory response cycle and undergo a respiratory burst, consuming lots of oxygen with the goal of creating toxic metabolites of oxygen. Neutrophils also use their myeloperoxidase enzyme to convert hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorite, a powerful germicidal agent (the active ingredient in bleach). These metabolites are stored in cytoplasmic granules and are released during neutrophil degranulation. This necrotic cell death releases further toxic metabolites, which causes further inflammatory pathway activation and further collateral tissue damage. This cascade can become a self-sustaining process if left unchecked. Pro-inflammatory mechanisms are kept in check by the immune system via the humoral, cellular, and neural mechanisms. Regulation by the humoral mechanism is characterized by an impaired function of immune cells with the expansion of regulatory T cells and myeloid suppressor cells that further reduce inflammation. Regulation by the neural mechanism involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and vagus nerve stimulating the adrenal gland to release norepinephrine and acetylcholine secretion by CD4 T cells which helps to suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the cellular level, there is inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene transcription."

On the cellular level, there is inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene transcription. Pathophysiology\nSepsis progressing to septic shock and multi-organ failure results from a worsening circulatory insufficiency characterized by hypovolemia, myocardial depression, increased metabolic demands, and vasoregulatory perfusion abnormalities. Classically, septic shock and inflammatory shock have been described as primarily systemic vasodilatation of both arteries and veins. This dilation reduces ventricular preload as well as afterload, by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. The typical hemodynamic pattern in septic shock consists of low cardiac filling pressures, low central venous pressures (CVP), and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). With low preload and afterload, cardiac output (CO) must increase to compensate, typically with increased heart rate (CO = Stroke Volume x Heart Rate). This is also why sepsis is thought of as a distributive shock and is also known as hyper-dynamic or warm shock. The vascular changes resulting in systemic vasodilatation can be attributed in large part to the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium and mitochondria. Part of the inflammatory process can be attributed to the enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO), which is a free radical and is produced in vascular endothelial cells. In addition to the inflammatory processes, sepsis is also associated with microvascular thrombosis. This is caused by activation of the clotting cascade with tissue factor and exacerbated by decreased anti-coagulation and impaired fibrinolysis. This leads to increased thrombus formation and therefore worsening tissue hypoperfusion. With thrombus formation and tissue hypoperfusion, the vascular endothelial cells also experience a loss of function with cadherin, and tight junctions are disrupted, leading to further capillary leak and increased interstitial edema."

With thrombus formation and tissue hypoperfusion, the vascular endothelial cells also experience a loss of function with cadherin, and tight junctions are disrupted, leading to further capillary leak and increased interstitial edema. To worsen this effect, red blood cells (RBC) have been shown to have decreased deformability during this inflammatory phase and will further contribute to poor tissue oxygenation. Vasodilation, disruption of the vascular endothelium, decreased RBC deformability, with the ensuing hypotension all contribute to worsening tissue oxygenation. Impaired tissue oxygenation will also cause mitochondrial dysfunction and lead to the shunting of pyruvate away from the Kreb cycle, which, when it accumulates, will be converted to lactate as a means of continuing metabolism in the critically ill. Hyperlactatemia in sepsis is the result of multiple metabolic adjustments, not simply tissue hypoperfusion. Conditions that are known to favor lactate production include systemic hypoperfusion necessitating anaerobic metabolism, regional hypoperfusion, and microcirculatory dysfunction. Additionally, increased aerobic glycolysis can produce an excess of pyruvate that overwhelms pyruvate dehydrogenase used to take the pyruvate into the Kreb cycle for aerobic metabolism. With the excess pyruvate present, a portion will be shunted to lactate conversion and accumulate in the cytoplasm prior to being dispersed in the bloodstream. This occurs in white blood cells, which rely on anaerobic metabolism, especially when activated during periods of infection or inflammation, and have been shown to contribute to increased blood levels of lactic acid. This increased production and decreased clearance of lactate results in hyperlactatemia. As this disease process progresses, further inflammatory cytokines are released, resulting in effects seen in both cardiac activity and splanchnic vasculature. Further depression of cardiac contractility, in both systolic and diastolic phases, is a result of these circulating inflammatory cytokines. Splanchnic blood flow is also affected and primarily shunted to other organs, especially once hypotension is present. This creates an increased risk for translocation of enteric pathogens and endotoxin across the bowel mucosa and into the systemic circulation, further aggravating the inciting condition. Alternatively, this process has been described in terms of oxygen demands and consumption."

Alternatively, this process has been described in terms of oxygen demands and consumption. Histopathology\nThe cellular and tissue changes induced by a shock are essentially those also seen in hypoxic injury states. As oxygen tension within the cell decreases, there is a loss of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased generation of ATP. The sodium pump fails, and potassium is lost with a concurrent influx of sodium and water, causing the cell to swell in size. With worsening hypoxia, there is a progressive loss of glycogen and decreased protein synthesis. As hypoxic injury continues, the cytoskeleton will disperse, and \u201cblebs\u201d will appear. Mitochondria will also exhibit swelling at this stage while the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains dilated. If oxygen is restored, a lot of these processes and injuries can be reversed. If hypoxia persists, irreversible injury and cellular necrosis will ensue. Cells at this stage exhibit severe swelling of mitochondria, extensive damage to plasma membranes, and swelling of lysosomes. Cellular death is mainly by necrosis. However, apoptosis also contributes as the mitochondria are believed to leak pro-apoptotic enzymes with swelling. Apoptosis is a pathway of cellular death that is induced by a tightly regulated program that uses its own enzymes to degrade the rest of the cell in the hopes of limiting collateral tissue damage. In sepsis and, more specifically, septic shock, these changes typically are more evident in tissues that are heavily dependent on blood flow and the elimination of cellular by-products, i.e., brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenals, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. With respect to the kidneys, biopsies from septic patients reveal a wide range of findings with \u201cnon-specific morphologic changes,\u201d not acute tubular necrosis, being the most commonly reported finding."

History and Physical\nThe history and physical exam will vary widely depending on where they fall on the continuum from SIRS to septic shock. Important considerations when taking a history in a patient with suspected sepsis are geared toward assessing those risk factors associated with increased mortality or higher incidence of sepsis as well as inquiring about possible sources of infection. Comorbidities associated with morbidity and mortality in sepsis include active cancer, diabetes, chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and liver disease(cirrhosis). Age, specifically older than 65 years old, has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis. This is because of the association of increasing age with a decrease in the adaptive immune system, with B and T cells showing impaired functionality. Alternatively, gender does not seem to play a role in sepsis mortality, as studies focusing on this subject are conflicting. The presence of any of these comorbidities should heighten the suspicion of the patient developing sepsis and prompt an earlier intervention if possible. Gathering information geared toward finding an infectious source will help tailor further intervention and management. Notably, a patient\u2019s recent history, hospitalization, and exposure to drug-resistant organisms may help direct what treatment to initiate. Retrospectively, sources of infection have been shown to be in the order of prevalence: pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections. However, the mortality rate is not related to the site of infection or the causative organism, including multi-drug-resistant organisms. Even with this caveat, finding a suspected source of infection is critical in the early stages of a patient\u2019s presentation. The physical portion of the exam will provide critically important vital signs, allowing for the utilization of clinical screening tools."

Evaluation\nWith the increased emphasis placed on earlier detection of sepsis, several clinical scores have been proposed to help further predict which patients are septic and which patients will ultimately have a worse outcome. SIRS, as defined above, has been criticized for being too general, and while being very sensitive, it is also not very specific. The SIRS criteria were developed as a way of identifying this systemic response based on vital signs and lab work, not the source of infection. However, when comparing even newer clinical tools, such as the qSOFA score (quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment), the SIRS criteria were still more sensitive. Ultimately, the difficulty in validating and finding a clinical tool that will detect a septic patient 100% of the time is that there is no gold standard for diagnosing sepsis. To diagnose sepsis in a patient, we still rely on three groups of clinical and laboratory data, namely, general systemic manifestations, manifestations of organ dysfunction/failure, and finally, microbiological documentation. The general systemic manifestations are taken into account with the SIRS criteria. Manifestations of organ failure or dysfunction can be seen in changes of platelets, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, and lactic acid, among many other surrogate markers. Microbiological documentation includes commonly blood cultures; however, they can include urine, peritoneal, synovial, respiratory secretions, and potentially cerebrospinal fluid(CSF). The downside is that in over one-third of clinical cases of sepsis and septic shock, the blood cultures are negative, as well contaminants can complicate the picture. Sepsis-2 Criteria (2001) defined parameters of both physical and laboratory findings present with organ dysfunction, heavily influencing the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and CMS Core Measure (SEP-1)."

These advances can be credited for the mortality improvement in septic patients that have been seen over the last 2 decades. However, with mortality from sepsis still approaching 20% to 25%, there are improvements still needed to treat and manage these complex patients. Therapies are directed at the basic elements of sepsis as a syndrome of infection, the host response, and organ dysfunction. The initial management of infection requires forming a probable diagnosis, obtaining cultures, and initiating appropriate and timely empirical anti-microbial therapy and source control. Attenuating the host response and accompanying organ dysfunction are both parts of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The initial resuscitation period was previously goal-directed, bundled care, something which the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines promote. Three large trials subsequently have shown no mortality benefit over usual care, which likely reflects the improvement of care, in general, with more of a trend toward early goal-directed therapies. Despite the numerous trials and recommendations evaluating the components of this resuscitation, it remains a subject of debate and the source of ongoing clinical trials.

For this reason, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the suspected source are recommended, not necessarily the most appropriate antimicrobial agent. Obtaining appropriate cultures is intended to influence care after this acute resuscitation phase has already passed. Lots of emphasis has been placed in the past on the timing and technique by which to obtain a blood culture with the greatest likelihood of returning a true positive result. There has been no correlation between the timing of a blood culture draw and detecting significant bacteremia. Recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) emphasize drawing them in a sterile manner from at least two different locations, with the volume of the blood cultured being emphasized rather than timing. Volume Resuscitation, in the acute phase, is recommended as being 30 ml/kg of crystalloid fluids. This fixed number was taken as the average volume of fluid given to patients in the PROCESS, ARISE, and PROMISE trials. The volume of intravenous fluids to give in early resuscitation is still a point of contention and debate, as half of those patients in the study did not receive 30 ml/kg, and half of those patients required more. The ideal fluid to administer is also a contested point, with a general recommendation for \"crystalloid fluids\" such as normal saline, Ringer's lactate, or balanced crystalloid solutions from the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Recent large trials and reviews on the subject report some benefits with buffered crystalloid solutions (Ringer\u2019s lactate) over normal saline. The guidelines for treating and managing sepsis do not reflect these findings. Vasopressors are indicated in septic shock if the condition fails to respond to the intravenous fluid bolus as recommended above. Vasopressors provide additional vascular contraction to assist in maintaining beneficial blood pressure, with a target MAP of greater than 65 mm Hg."

This typically includes a thorough clinical examination and the concurrent variables of heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, and respiratory rate, among others. There have been multiple attempts at clearly defining these goals for acute resuscitation, and have included, at different times, measuring central venous pressure (CVP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), trending lactic acid, stroke volume measurements, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and urine output. CVP measurements have been fraught with imprecision and not found to be useful in predicting whether or not a patient will respond to additional intravenous fluid administration. Mean arterial pressure is the force behind perfusion in the peripheral organs and tissues and should be the goal for both fluid and vasopressor administration. An elevated lactic acid, while not directly a result of tissue perfusion, especially in sepsis, has been directly related to increased mortality. Lactate clearance has also been suggested as a goal for early resuscitation, as a decrease of only 10% in the first 6 hours corresponded to an 11% decrease in the likelihood of mortality, as compared to patients who were unable to achieve this. However, there is weak evidence of a reduction in mortality when lactate-guided resuscitation is employed over usual care."

For compliance with CMS core measures, as noted in the guidelines above, documented reassessment of volume status and tissue perfusion should include vital signs, cardiopulmonary, capillary refill, pulse, and skin findings. The widely held belief that in sepsis tissue, hypoxia was the problem led to liberal transfusions of packed red blood cells to increase oxygen delivery in the early years of sepsis management. This, however, has since been disproven with the transfusion requirements in septic shock trials addressing mortality with a lower threshold transfusion of 7 g/dL versus a 9 g/dL. Targeting a lower transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL in septic patients is the current recommendation unless there are signs of critical coronary disease, myocardial ischemia, or acute hemorrhage. Corticosteroids have 2 important implications in severe sepsis and septic shock, namely that they have anti-inflammatory activity and that they magnify the vaso-constricting response to catecholamines. The conflicting support for the routine use of steroids in severe sepsis and septic shock has led to inconsistent recommendations for its use, despite more than 50 years of trials looking at its benefit in septic shock. Recently the CORTICUS and ADRENAL trials focusing on this point have failed to show a direct mortality benefit. However, there was a decreased length of ICU stay and days on vasopressors in survivors. The APROCCHSS trial, in contrast, looking at a fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone combination, did show a mortality benefit in septic shock patients without an increase in adverse events. Currently, the recommendations support its use in refractory septic shock that has not responded to intravenous fluids and vasopressor therapy as well a low-dose prolonged course should be continued while the patient is on vasopressor therapy. Hydrocortisone is the preferred corticosteroid because of its mineralocorticoid effects. Mechanical ventilation is an important component of management as the respiratory system, predominantly the lungs, is the most commonly affected organ in severe sepsis and septic shock."

Mechanical ventilation is an important component of management as the respiratory system, predominantly the lungs, is the most commonly affected organ in severe sepsis and septic shock. In the event, the patient experiences acute lung injury that progresses to ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, a lung-protective strategy is needed. In the landmark ARDSNet trial, patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and had developed ARDS had lower mortality and decreased ventilator-dependent days with a lung-protective strategy. This strategy employed a lower tidal volume strategy of 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and kept plateau pressures under 30 cm H2O. Targeted treatments at different intersections in the newer models of sepsis have been continually developed and usually have been unsuccessful at providing any mortality benefit routinely. Drotrecogin alfa, which is recombinant human-activated protein C, was approved by the FDA in 2001 and was thought to promote fibrinolysis and inhibit thrombosis, which would have a significant impact on the pro-inflammatory state and complications involved in sepsis and septic shock. This was not the case, as it was withdrawn from the market after further studies were published showing no benefit and potentially worse outcomes. Further efforts were made to look at the administration of monoclonal antibodies against TNF, blocking IL-1 activity, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), NO inhibitors, anti-thrombin, N-acetylcysteine, and using antibodies to endotoxin; however, these too failed to demonstrate efficacy. Despite these failures, further development of other immunomodulating agents and the proposed \"metabolic cocktail\" continue to be pursued, as mortality, even with newer therapies, remains unacceptably high."

Prognosis\nAlthough morbidity and mortality from sepsis have declined in the last 2 decades considerably, there remains a large need for improvement in management. This decline in mortality associated with sepsis can be in part attributed to earlier recognition and intervention, as well as advances in the understanding of this disease process. Important markers for disease severity and prognostic implications, such as the SIRS or qSOFA criterion, have been able to provide some framework for treatment as well as insight into the prognosis for affected patients. Goal-directed therapies that have contributed to this decline in mortality are geared towards goals that have significant prognostic implications. For example, lactic acid accumulation in the setting of sepsis has been shown to be highly specific for predicting the acute phase of death and in-hospital mortality as it increases with levels greater than 4 mmol/L having a 28.4% likelihood of mortality. Although using lactate to guide therapy has not been shown to independently affect mortality in these patients, 2-hour lactate clearance has been shown to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. With the implementation of bundle-based care, retrospective studies have also shown greater in-hospital mortality when compared to times to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and completion of a 3-hour bundle. This has some prognostic value attached to it, as completion of the intravenous fluid bolus was not shown to affect mortality. Clinical scores such as the qSOFA and SIRS scores have been able to be applied in early settings, with worsening scores corresponding to greater in-hospital mortality. For patients requiring ICU-level care, the SOFA score has been shown to be the best predictor for in-hospital mortality."

Long-term mortality data with respect to many of the interventions already discussed above is lacking. Mortality following hospitalization from sepsis is high, with rates reported around 31% in the first year and nearing 43% by year 2. Recognized long-term complications of patients with sepsis include critical illness weakness, delirium, and acute lung injury, which have a greater impact on morbidity and mortality outside of the first 28 days. Other investigations into late predictors of mortality suggest a pro-inflammatory state of accelerated atherosclerosis and chronic immunosuppression that also contributes to the high mortality rate seen in these patients. Despite advances in sepsis management resulting in an improvement in short-term mortality, the prognosis for patients surviving sepsis still remains poor, with overall mortality rates remaining seemingly unaffected."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nOver 100 years of data show improved patient outcomes, regardless of the disease process, when healthcare professionals collaborate, acting as an interprofessional team. The treatment and management of sepsis and septic shock, especially as the condition progresses, involves nearly every aspect of healthcare. With the implementation of bundled care, communication between physicians, nursing staff, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists becomes more important as these interventions must be implemented swiftly and correctly. With later identification of sepsis resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, emphasis on earlier recognition algorithms has been studied in multiple interprofessional trials. In one such trial using ancillary staff and then emergency nursing staff in the early identification of sepsis, there was an increased staff knowledge of sepsis, decreased emergency department length of stay, and a statistically significant decrease in mortality. Other similar studies showed a greater distribution of responsibility in the management of these complex patients from physicians to respiratory therapists and nursing staff, showing improved patient outcomes. Like treatment, management, and rapid identification of sepsis all play a role in successful patient outcomes, the emphasis on education involving an interprofessional team has increased as well.\nMultiple curriculums and recommendations for addressing the development of these interprofessional teams have been put forth and typically focus on fluid resuscitation, empiric antibiotics, and vasopressor therapy. Developing a successful strategy for managing and treating a complex disease process, such as sepsis, requires an interprofessional team approach."

These pathogens can ascend the vagina, the cervix, and the uterus and can also infect the amniotic fluid. Neonates can also become infected in utero or during delivery as they pass through the vaginal canal. Typical bacterial pathogens for EOS include group B streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenza, and Listeria monocytogenes. Maternal factors that increase the risk of neonatal sepsis include chorioamnionitis, GBS colonization, delivery before 37 weeks, and prolonged rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours .\nLOS usually occurs via transmitting pathogens from the surrounding environment after delivery, such as contact from healthcare workers or caregivers. A percentage of LOS may also be caused by a late manifestation of vertically transmitted infection. Infants requiring intravascular catheter insertion or other invasive procedures that disrupt the mucosa are at increased risk for developing LOS. Preterm neonates are at higher risk for sepsis/infection than term neonates. The increased susceptibility for infections seen in preterm neonates is mainly due to :\n- Deficient immune system, mainly due to decreased IgG antibodies and incompetent opsonization and complement activation\n- Comprised innate immune system, caused primarily by the immature epithelial barrier\n- The increased need for invasive devices (vascular access, endotracheal tube, feeding tubes, and urinary tract catheters) due to associated severe illnesses\nCoagulase-negative staphylococcal species, especially Staphylococcus epidermis, are the leading cause, responsible for over 50% of LOS cases in industrialized countries.

The incidence of EOS has decreased since the 1990s due to the introduction of universal screening of GBS in pregnant women and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. However, rates of LOS have remained relatively the same. Escherichia coli now accounts for more cases of EOS . The incidence of EOS with positive blood cultures in the United States is estimated to be 0.77 to 1 per 1,000 live births . Due to the nonspecific neonatal presentation for sepsis and the high risk of mortality and morbidity without treatment, many asymptomatic neonates undergo a sepsis workup if risk factors are present and/or clinically indicated. Although approximately 7% to 13% of all neonates are treated for sepsis, only 3% to 8% have positive cultures . Maternal administration of antibiotics and the low blood volume obtained for blood culture could explain the low rate of positive blood cultures. The incidence of sepsis is significantly higher in premature infants, as well as those with very low birth weight (\\<1000 grams). African American infants have an increased risk of GBS and LOS, likely secondary to the higher rate of GBS carrier rates in African American females.

Evaluation\nNeonates with bacteremia can be asymptomatic and have a normal physical examination. Thus, laboratory testing plays an important role in diagnosis. In a neonate with suspected sepsis, a blood culture should be immediately drawn. It is recommended to draw at least 1 ml of blood as low-level bacteremia may not be detected with smaller aliquotes . Cultures should also be drawn from the catheter site if 1 is in place. Urine cultures are usually not recommended for evaluating EOS but should be considered for evaluating LOS . Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and culture should be evaluated in any infant with positive blood culture or if the neonate has a clinical presentation that suggests central nervous system involvement. Lumbar puncture should be repeated within 48 hours of therapy to confirm sterility of the CSF.

Treatment / Management\nEmpiric antibiotic treatment should be started when sepsis is clinically suspected, even without confirmatory lab data. In general, antimicrobial resistance patterns of common bacteria in the neonatal intensive care unit should guide antibiotics' initial choice. Typical treatment regimens include intravenous (IV) ampicillin and aminoglycosides to cover the most common pathogens in EOS (GBS, _E. coli_ , and _L. monocytogenes)_ . With LOS, nosocomial coverage should be provided for hospital-acquired pathogens such as coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ , _S. aureus_ , and _Pseudomonas_ species.

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nNeonatal sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Attempts to prevent sepsis's development or progression have driven many quality improvement projects in newborn nurseries and NICUs.Managing such infants is complex and requires a multidisciplinary care approach, including clinicians, pharmacies, lactation consultants, and social workers supported by medical decisions made during family-based care rounds. Obstetric physicians are important in ensuring that GBS screening and all other prenatal screening for infections are performed and adequately treated before and during delivery. Nursery nurses are also important in preventing and managing neonatal sepsis as they can pick up and detect early signs of sepsis. In-hospital pediatricians are essential in managing the evolving treatment of neonatal sepsis and making adjustments as necessary. They are also important in contacting the proper consultants, such as pediatric surgeons and pharmacists. Despite optimal treatment, neonatal sepsis continues to have high mortality rates and poor outcomes. While the mortality rates have started to decline, the recovery for most infants is prolonged, and there is a risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities."

An increase in the prevalence of the latter may be attributable to the performance of more invasive procedures and increased incidence of nosocomial infections. Predominant micro-organisms isolated in patients include _Staphylococcus aureus_ (20%), _Pseudomonas_ (20%), and _Escherichia coli_ (16%). Predominant sites of infection include respiratory (42%), bloodstream (21%), and genitourinary (10%). These data need to be assessed in the context of knowing that over a third of patients never grow positive cultures.\nThe influence of bacterial strain and site of infection on mortality was illustrated in a large meta-analysis. In this study, gram-negative infections were overall associated with higher mortality. However, gram-positive bacteremia with _Acinetobacter_ or pneumonia with _Staphylococcus_ carried a 40% mortality with _Pseudomonal_ pneumonia carrying the highest mortality at 70%.\nSepsis syndromes caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)) are on the rise with a current incidence of up to 25%; viruses and parasites cause far fewer cases and are identified in 2% to 4% of cases.\nRisk factors that predispose to sepsis include:\n- Diabetes\n- Malignancy\n- Chronic kidney and liver disease\n- Use of corticosteroids\n- Immunosuppressed state\n- Burns\n- Major surgery\n- Trauma\n- Presence of indwelling catheters\n- Prolonged hospitalization\n- Hemodialysis\n- Extremes of age"

Accompanying this trend has been a rise in healthcare expenditure, making sepsis the most expensive healthcare condition in 2009, accounting for 5% of total United States hospital costs.

Pathophysiology\nSepsis is a clinical state that falls along a continuum of pathophysiologic states, starting with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ending in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) before death. The earliest signs of inflammation are heralded by the following:\n1. Fever (temperature higher than 38 C or hypothermia (temperature less than 36 C)\n1. Tachycardia (heart rate more than 90 beats per minute),\n1. Tachypnea (respiratory rate more than 20 breaths per minute)\n1. Leukocytosis (WBC greater than 12,000/cu mm) / leukopenia (white blood cells (WBC) less than 4,000/cu mm) with or without bandemia (more than 10%). The presence of two of these four clinical signs is necessary for the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. After that, systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious source suffices the clinical definition for sepsis. With the development of hypotension, tissue demands are not adequately met by tissue oxygenation, and the patient is now defined to be in severe sepsis. The decline in peripheral vascular perfusion and oxygenation leads to cellular and metabolic derangements, most notably a shift from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration with ensuing lactic acidosis. Tissue hypoperfusion may also be manifested by signs of end-organ damage, such as pre-renal azotemia or transaminitis. The difference in oxygen supply and demand can be monitored during resuscitation by trending the mixed venous oxygen saturation from a central line in the superior vena cava (SVC) when available. When sepsis-induced hypotension remains refractory to initial management with fluid resuscitation, septic shock ensues. Septic shock is distinguished from other shock states as a distributive type of shock."

    "text": "When sepsis-induced hypotension remains refractory to initial management with fluid resuscitation, septic shock ensues. Septic shock is distinguished from other shock states as a distributive type of shock. The action of a combination of inflammatory mediators (histamine, serotonin, super-radicals, lysosomal enzymes) elaborated in response to bacterial endotoxins leads to a marked increase in capillary permeability and a concomitant reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. This translates not only into a reduction in afterload but also in preload from a decline in venous return from third-spacing. The resulting reduction in stroke volume is accommodated initially by an elevation in heart rate, i.e., compensated septic shock. As a result, the patient is in a hyperdynamic state that is characteristic of septic shock. Clinically, patients have a dynamic precordium with tachycardia and bounding peripheral pulses. They are warm to the touch and have a reduction in capillary refill (flash cap refill). This is described as warm shock. As shock progresses, elevated catecholamine production leads to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance as the body attempts to shunt blood away from non-vital tissues (gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidneys, muscle, and skin) to the vital tissues (brain and heart). This is described as cold shock. Understanding the pathophysiology and continuum of septic shock is imperative in initiating appropriate treatment measures. Functionally, septic shock is defined by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation from 60 ml/kg to 80 mL/kg of either crystalloid or colloid fluid. At this point, the initiation of appropriate vasoactive medications such as beta-adrenergic or alpha-adrenergic drugs is of utmost importance. The progression of organ dysfunction despite high-dose vasoactive administration defines the state of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which carries mortality as high as 75%. While the exact circumstances predicting poor prognosis and death have been difficult to determine, immunologic dissonance (exaggerated pro-inflammatory response) versus immunologic paralysis (exaggerated anti-inflammatory response) have been purported to play a role."

History and Physical\n**Early Signs and Symptoms**\nSepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome plus an infectious source. Therefore, earlier on in the presentation of sepsis, patients present with the following vital sign changes:\n- Fever, temperature higher than 38 C, or hypothermia, temperature lower than 36 C\n- Tachycardia with a heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute in adult patients or less than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients\n- Tachypnea with respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute in adult patients or more than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients\n**Signs and Symptoms of Severe Sepsis** Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis and end-organ dysfunction. At this stage, signs and symptoms may include:\n- Altered mental status\n- Oliguria or anuria\n- Hypoxia\n- Cyanosis\n- Ileus\nPatients progressing to septic shock will experience signs and symptoms of severe sepsis with hypotension. Of note, at an early \"compensated\" stage of shock, blood pressure may be maintained, and other signs of distributive shock might be present, for example, warm extremities, flash capillary refill (less than one second), and bounding pulses, also known as warm shock. This stage of shock, if managed aggressively with fluid resuscitation and vasoactive support, can be reversed. With the progression of septic shock into the uncompensated stage, hypotension ensues, and patients may present with cool extremities, delayed capillary refill (more than three seconds), and thready pulses, also known as cold shock. After that, with continued tissue hypoperfusion, shock may be irreversible, progressive rapidly into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death."

Evaluation\n**Laboratory Findings**\nFindings in sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock are as follows \\[16\\]:\n- Hyperglycemia (glucose more than 120 mg/dL)\n- Leukocytosis (WBC more than 12,000/mm3) or leukopenia (WBC less than 4000/mm3)\n- Bandemia (more than 10%)\n- C-reactive protein or procalcitonin more than 2 SD above normal\n- Mixed venous saturation of more than 70%\n- PaO2: FiO2 less than 300\n- Pre-renal azotemia\n- Coagulopathy, INR more than 1.5 or PTT more than 60 sec\n- Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL)\n- Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin more than 4 mg/dL)\n- Lactic acidosis (more than 2 mmol/L)\nPatients should be placed on continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring to allow close observation of vital signs. A thorough assessment of end-organ function and peripheral perfusion should be undertaken to determine where they may fall along the pathophysiologic continuum of sepsis. This should include a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) or mental status assessment, urine output measurement, or lactate/mixed venous saturation determination (with central lines). Regardless of where along the continuum patients are, all patients should have drawn a complete blood count with differential (CBC-d), source cultures (blood, urine, tracheal (if intubated), wound), and a urinalysis. Depending on the severity of presentation and age of the patient, a lumbar puncture may be indicated, for example, in patients with signs of encephalitis or meningitis or febrile pediatric patients under six weeks of age. The addition of C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, both acute-phase proteins, may be helpful in distinguishing viral from bacterial sepsis, with the latter showing steeper elevations in these proteins."

Treatment / Management\nThe below guidelines are derived from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines\n**Source Control**\n1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis for all patients. Initial empiric anti-infective therapy should have activity against all likely pathogens and adequate penetration of source tissue. 1. Removal of infected/necrotic tissue if it is the source of septic shock, ie, patients with cellulitis, abscess, infected devices, or purulent wounds. **Management of Shock**\n1. Measures are most effective if achieved within the first six hours of diagnosis. 1. Restore central venous pressure (CVP) to 8 mmHg to 12 mm Hg\n1. Restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mm Hg\n1. Restore superior vena cava saturation to 70% or mixed venous saturation to 65%\n1. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (NS or albumin) and colloid (blood products) up to 80 ml/kg\n1. Mechanical ventilation to reduce metabolic demand\n1. First-line vasoactive agents (epinephrine in cold shock versus norepinephrine in warm shock) when fluid-refractoryNote: dopamine as a first-line agent has fallen out of favor given its inhibitory effect on the HPA axis, namely prolactin and growth hormone, which can confer immunologic dysfunction\n**Enhancing Host Response**\n1. Corticosteroids indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock and or in patients with low (unstimulated) basal cortisol levels less than 150 \u03bcg/L)\n1. Addition of vasopressin indicated in vasoactive-refractory shock\nWhile central lines are not required for the resuscitation of patients with septic shock, they provide an accurate means of monitoring CVP and mixed venous oxygen. Remember that CVP and MVO2 are most accurate from a central line that lies within the right atrium; lower extremity central lines do not provide the most accurate data for monitoring these indices of resuscitation."

Regarding the need for central venous access for the administration of vasoactive agents, a recent study showed that both dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine at high doses could be safely administered via peripheral venous access. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has not been shown to confer a survival benefit in more recent studies. All studies comparing EGDT to standard practice have shown an increase in the administration of crystalloid and packed red blood cells in the first six hours and the placement of central lines. Furthermore, survival was influenced most by the maintenance of blood pressure independent of the type of fluid or vasoactive used and not CVP or MVO2. That said, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines continue to support EGDT as the standard of practice for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock. The placement of an arterial line becomes important in the management of vasoactive-refractory shock for close monitoring of blood pressure and tissue oxygenation status via regular blood gasses with key attention to lactate levels and pO2. Patients with sepsis have a high metabolism, and thus, prolonged starvation should be avoided. Early nutrition can help protect gut mucosa and prevent the translocation of organisms from the GI tract into systemic circulation."

Early nutrition can help protect gut mucosa and prevent the translocation of organisms from the GI tract into systemic circulation. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe management of septic shock is best done with an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses. The key is early diagnosis and resuscitation to maintain end-organ perfusion. The type of fluid for resuscitation has little bearing on outcomes but the key is to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. Patients with sepsis are prone to many complications, which have high mortality. Thus, close monitoring and prevention of these complications are vital. Primary disorders like diabetes and renal or liver failure must be treated. Drugs that affect the immune system should be discontinued. The dietitian should be consulted as there is good evidence that early enteral nutrition is beneficial. The nurse should ensure DVT and pressure sore prophylaxis. The nurse should also monitor all catheters for infection and remove those that are not needed. The pharmacists should follow culture results and ensure the patient is on organism-sensitive antibiotics. Clinicians should maintain aseptic techniques during procedures, and hand washing should be practiced. The entire team should communicate with each other to ensure that the patient is receiving optimal care.\nThe outcomes of septic shock depend on patient age, associated comorbidities, renal function, need for dialysis, requiring mechanical ventilation, and response to treatment."
