    "text": "Introduction\nMountainous regions are a destination for adventure travel, seasonal work, and permanent residence for many people. More than 40 million people visit high altitude areas (greater than 2500 meters) every year, and a reported 140 million have a permanent residence at these elevations. The decreased barometric and partial pressures of oxygen at high altitudes can reduce inspired oxygen levels compared to sea levels. The body's exaggerated physiological response to rapid ascent, a lower level of inspired oxygen, or the persistent hypoxic stimulus experienced at high altitude can cause significant morbidity and mortality. High altitude-associated disease processes can vary from mild to life-threatening. The body's response can present in acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and, ultimately, high-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH). Acute mountain sickness develops secondary to rapid ascent and can be described as a \"hangover, \" including nonspecific symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia.\nHigh altitude pulmonary edema is a progression of acute mountain sickness and presents with acute pulmonary, a complication of the body's poor acclimatization. High altitude cerebral edema, the most feared complication of altitude sickness, involves cerebral edema and associated neurological symptoms and sequela. Chronic hypoxic stimuli of high altitude living can result in permanent pulmonary vascular remodeling due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and define a subgroup of pulmonary hypertension known as HAPH. This topic focuses primarily on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of HAPH."

This topic focuses primarily on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of HAPH. Pathophysiology\nHypoxic stress at high altitudes induces a variety of physiological changes. Many organ systems utilize vasodilation to enhance oxygen delivery in hypoxia. In contrast, the lung responds to hypoxia with increased pulmonary vasoconstriction. Blood is shunted away from poorly oxygenated lung zones towards healthy alveoli to minimize V/Q mismatch. This intuitively makes sense in the setting of lobar pneumonia or other focal disease processes involving the lung. In HAPH, all lung fields experience the same degree of hypoxia. Significant vasoconstriction in all parts of the lung and elevated pulmonary artery pressures lead to pulmonary hypertension. The increased pulmonary pressure forces fluid into the lungs, causing acute pulmonary edema.\nVascular remodeling plays a major role in the pathophysiology of HAPH. Hypoxia ultimately leads to vascular remodeling by triggering pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance in the small pulmonary veins and arteries. At the cellular level, chronic hypoxia causes channelopathy of both potassium and calcium channels, increasing intracellular calcium. The proliferation of smooth muscle within the pulmonary vasculature occurs, a structure normally devoid of smooth muscle cells (fibroblasts). Vascular remodeling can be a long-term and irreversible sequela of chronic hypoxia and persist despite the removal of the hypoxic stimulus.\nEndothelial nitrous oxide is theorized to play a role in the development of HAPH. Longstanding hypoxia is known to decrease nitrous oxide synthesis, contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Research and comparison of different subpopulations have demonstrated that increased nitrous oxide concentrations in pulmonary endothelium decrease the prevalence of HAPH. Studies have shown that individuals from Tibet have high nitrous oxide concentrations, which correlates with a lower prevalence of HAPH than the South American Andean population."

Studies have shown that individuals from Tibet have high nitrous oxide concentrations, which correlates with a lower prevalence of HAPH than the South American Andean population. Evaluation\nPatients who present with signs and symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea, fatigue, or peripheral edema should be evaluated for heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. To diagnose HAPH, the patient must reside at an elevation greater than 2,500 meters. Other diagnoses besides pulmonary hypertension should always be considered. Diagnostic tests that can be utilized are an EKG, echocardiogram, chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, or a right-sided heart catheterization with pulmonary angiography.\n- An EKG can be consistent with chronic right heart strain and have findings of right ventricular hypertrophy, right bundle branch block, and tall p-waves in inferior leads.\n- An echocardiogram can show a dilated right ventricle and right atrium and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Left ventricular function and ejection fraction must also be assessed to rule out left-sided heart failure.\n- The chest X-ray may be normal or show signs of cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion.\n- Pulmonary function tests are useful in excluding diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or other interstitial lung diseases.\nRight-sided heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography are the most important diagnostic tools for establishing a definitive diagnosis. A mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) greater than 30 mmHg or systolic PAP of greater than 50 mmHg is diagnostic for pulmonary hypertension. If possible, it is important to attempt catheterization and angiography at the altitude of residence."

If possible, it is important to attempt catheterization and angiography at the altitude of residence. Treatment / Management\nLimited data is currently available to guide the long-term management of HAPH. Several studies have shown that some treatments recommended for managing other causes of pulmonary hypertension have improved symptoms and mPAPs. Patients suffering from HAPH should be advised to move to lower altitudes. Some studies have shown that mPAPs for patients have normalized within 2 years of returning to lower altitudes. Pharmacological treatments for HAPH can include phosphodiesterase and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, Sildenafil) block the breakdown of nitrous oxide, promote pulmonary artery vasodilation, and decrease mPAP.\n- Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (ie, Acetazolamide) are useful in preventing acute mountain sickness. Studies have also shown a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. However, Acetazolamide has not been studied specifically for treating HAPH, and the benefits may be minimal. Due to Acetazolamide's low side effect profile, it is safe to incorporate as a treatment option.\n- Endothelin receptor blockers (ie, Bosentan) have also been used to treat pulmonary hypertension.\nSome studies have shown that venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be beneficial for severe cases in the acute setting. Despite all efforts and recommendations, if an individual develops irreversible pulmonary hypertension, the mainstay of treatment is pulmonary transplantation."

    "text": "History and Physical\nIn patients who present with markedly elevated blood pressure, a careful history and exam are necessary to determine which of these patients is having a true hypertensive emergency. Symptoms such as a headache, dizziness, altered mental status, shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased urine output, vomiting, or changes in vision warrant further evaluation. The source of the abrupt onset of hypertension should also be investigated to direct treatment.\nThe expected exam findings vary depending on the specific target organ most affected. With cardiac dysfunction, rales may be heard on lung auscultation, jugular venous distention or peripheral edema may be noted, and extra heart sounds may be apparent. In the event of a very rapid onset of hypertension, often seen with sympathomimetic abuse, marked dyspnea in the absence of peripheral edema due to flash pulmonary edema may be encountered.\nNeurologic dysfunction may result in altered mental status, blurry vision, ataxia or other cerebellar dysfunction, aphasia, or unilateral numbness or weakness. A careful neurologic exam that includes a cranial nerve exam, strength, and sensation testing, as well as cerebellar tests and gait testing should be done. The eye exam may reveal papilledema as well as exudates and flame-shaped hemorrhages.\nAcute renal failure may also result in signs of pulmonary edema or peripheral edema."

The eye exam may reveal papilledema as well as exudates and flame-shaped hemorrhages. Acute renal failure may also result in signs of pulmonary edema or peripheral edema. Treatment / Management\nWhile the specific target organ that is affected may dictate some specifics of treatment, rapid lowering of blood pressure is the mainstay of therapy for hypertensive emergencies. The goal would be to lower the mean arterial pressure by 20% to 25% within the first 1 to 2 hours. Several agents can be used, but the unifying characteristics are that they are rapidly acting and easily titratable. For this reason, oral medications, such as clonidine and nifedipine, play no role in the immediate management of a hypertensive emergency. Intravenous vasoactive drips such as labetalol, esmolol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin are typically effective options.\nThe key feature about management is that if there is no evidence of organ damage, then the blood pressure reduction should be gradual over a few days. On the other hand, severe hypertension in pregnancy demands immediate treatment. Female patients who become pregnant should be prescribed nifedipine, methyldopa, or labetalol during pregnancy; these women should not be treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. During the acute event, IV hydralazine or oral nifedipine can be used to lower blood pressure.\n**Current Guidelines**\n1. Patients with a hypertensive emergency need admission with continuous blood pressure monitoring.\n1. Assess for target organ injury and start parenteral medications as needed\n1. If the patient has an acute emergency like aortic dissection, lower the blood pressure to below 140 mmHg in the first hour\n1. for adults with no organ damage, lower the blood pressure by 25% in the first hour and then to 160/100 over the next 2-6 hours, and then gradually to normal over 2 days."

    "text": "Pearls and Other Issues\nMarkedly elevated blood pressure is common with acute ischemic stroke and requires a specialized approach. Per AHA/ASA guidelines, patients eligible for thrombolysis should have blood pressure lowered to SBP lower than 185 mmHg and DBP lower than 110 mmHg and maintained at SBP lower than 180 mmHg and DBP lower than 105 mmHg for the first 24 hours. For those not receiving thrombolytics, only levels of SBP higher than 220 mmHg or DBP higher than 120 mmHg should be lowered as hypertension in acute stroke is usually transient and may be protective. A reasonable goal is about a 15% decrease in mean arterial pressure. In an acute hemorrhagic stroke, reduction of SBP to lower than 140 mmHg may improve functional outcomes. This requires an aggressive approach with rapidly titrated intravenous antihypertensives, and extreme vigilance is necessary to prevent hypotension, which causes decreased cerebral perfusion pressure and adds to the ischemic insult. Easily titratable medications with rapid onset and short duration of action, such as nicardipine, are recommended. Aortic dissection also deviates in the degree of blood pressure lowering that is recommended. Traditional teaching is to lower the blood pressure to as low as organs will allow, with close monitoring of the patient\u2019s mental status as a guide. Intravenous beta-blockers, most commonly esmolol, are first-line treatments due to their ability to lower blood pressure while avoiding reflex tachycardia and increased shear stress to the aortic wall. Classically, nitroprusside has been used as an adjunct to beta-blockers in the treatment of aortic dissection, but this has become an infrequent practice due to its association with rapid and profound hypotension, tachyphylaxis, as well as the potential for cyanide toxicity. Nicardipine with the addition of a beta-blocker would also be a reasonable choice. Preeclampsia is a particularly troubling and difficult to manage hypertensive emergency since there are two patients to consider."

Preeclampsia is a particularly troubling and difficult to manage hypertensive emergency since there are two patients to consider. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nHypertensive emergency is not an uncommon presentation to the ER. Despite awareness of its high morbidity and mortality, at least 50% of patients with hypertension do not remain compliant with their medications. The problem is exacerbated when the only access for these patients is the emergency room. There are countless guidelines by national agencies and organizations on blood pressure control, but many patients do not seem to appreciate the seriousness of hypertension. An interprofessional approach to the management of hypertension is recommended beginning with the primary caregiver. Patients need to be educated about the importance of antihypertensive medications by the pharmacist, discharge nurse, and primary care provider. The treatment of hypertension is best done as an outpatient; the few minutes spent with a cardiologist in a hospital very rarely makes any difference. The pharmacist, nurse, and the primary practitioner have a vital role to play in the education of patients with hypertension. The need to regularly measure the blood pressure and follow up with the healthcare provider cannot be overemphasized. Patients need to be told to change their lifestyle, eat healthy, exercise, discontinue smoking, and remain medication compliant. At every clinic visit, the blood pressure should be monitored. A social worker should be involved in the care to ensure that the patient's financial status is not limiting the ability to buy the medications. Sadly, evidence-based guidelines have not translated in reducing the number of people still presenting to the ER with hypertensive emergencies. **Outcomes**\nThere are many case series indicating that the short-term management of hypertensive emergency has good outcomes but the long-term results remain unknown. Part of the problem is that patients are lost to follow-up, and the medication regimen is frequently changed."
