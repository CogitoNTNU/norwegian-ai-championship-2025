    "text": "Clinical Significance\n**Prothrombin Time**\nPT measures the time it takes for blood to clot, primarily assessing the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Normal PT values range from 9 to 13 seconds. Higher PT values indicate a prolonged clotting time, suggesting potential issues with clotting factors such as fibrinogen, factor V, VII, X, and prothrombin. Abnormal PT values may indicate liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or the presence of anticoagulants. **Partial Thromboplastin Time**\nPTT, evaluates the intrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade, assessing factors such as VIII, IX, XI, and XII, as well as fibrinogen. Normal PTT values range from 25 to 35 seconds. Prolonged PTT may signify deficiencies in these clotting factors, hemophilia, or the presence of inhibitors. Shortened PTT, on the other hand, may indicate an increased risk of thrombosis and could be associated with elevated factor VIII levels. **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time**\nSimilar to PTT, aPTT measures the same coagulation factors as PTT but with an activator added. Therefore, aPTT has a narrower range and may be more specific for certain conditions. **International Normalized Ratio**\nINR is a standardized measure of PT, ensuring consistency in results across different laboratories. The normal range for INR is around 0.8 to 1.2. Higher INR values suggest a slower clotting time and an increased risk of bleeding. INR is particularly crucial for individuals on oral anticoagulants like warfarin, where maintaining a target INR range is essential for balancing the risk of bleeding and clotting. **D-Dimer**\nD-dimer is a marker for fibrin degradation products, indicating ongoing fibrinolysis. Normal D-dimer values are typically less than 500 ng/mL. Elevated D-dimer levels may be observed in conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other conditions associated with increased fibrin turnover. However, D-dimer is not specific, and elevated levels can also be seen in inflammation, infection, surgery, or pregnancy."

However, D-dimer is not specific, and elevated levels can also be seen in inflammation, infection, surgery, or pregnancy. **Clinical Significance**\n**Prothrombin Time**\nThe clinical significance of prothrombin time lies in its utility for monitoring and managing anticoagulant therapy, assessing liver function, and diagnosing bleeding disorders. - **Monitoring anticoagulant therapy:** PT is commonly used to monitor patients on oral anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin. Warfarin interferes with the synthesis of certain clotting factors, including factor II (prothrombin), and monitoring PT helps ensure that the patient is within the therapeutic range. The INR is often reported along with PT results to standardize the interpretation of the test across different laboratories. - **Assessing liver function:** PT is also used to assess liver function since the liver produces many clotting factors. Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or liver failure, can decrease the synthesis of clotting factors, resulting in prolonged PT. - **Diagnosing bleeding disorders:** Prolonged PT can detect abnormalities in the clotting factors involved in the extrinsic and common pathways. This can help diagnose conditions such as hemophilia, vitamin K deficiency, or other inherited or acquired bleeding disorders. - **Preoperative screening:** PT is sometimes used as part of preoperative screening to assess a patient's overall clotting ability. This helps identify individuals who may be at increased risk of bleeding during surgery. - **Monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation:** PT can be one of the parameters monitored in patients with DIC, a condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade. In DIC, both clotting factors and platelets are consumed, leading to abnormal bleeding and clotting at the same time. - **Assessing vitamin K status:** Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of certain clotting factors. PT can be used to assess vitamin K status, and prolonged PT may suggest a deficiency in this vitamin. **Partial Thromboplastin Time**\nPTT is often used with other tests, such as PT, to evaluate the overall coagulation function and monitor patients on anticoagulant therapy."

It's important to note that the PTT results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory tests. Abnormal PTT results may indicate a need for further investigation and targeted therapies based on the underlying cause\n**International Normalized Ratio**\nThe INR is widely used to monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulant medications, particularly warfarin, in patients with conditions such as atrial fibrillation, DVT, and PE. The clinical significance of INR lies in its role in managing and adjusting anticoagulant therapy to prevent both excessive bleeding and inadequate clotting. Here are some key points regarding the clinical significance of INR:\n- **Warfarin monitoring:** INR is most commonly used to monitor patients taking warfarin. Warfarin works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, and its dosage needs to be carefully adjusted to maintain a balance between preventing clot formation and avoiding excessive bleeding. - **Thromboembolic risk reduction:** Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of blood clots in conditions such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, and venous thromboembolism. INR monitoring ensures that the anticoagulant dose is within a therapeutic range, optimizing its efficacy in preventing thromboembolic events. - **Target INR range:** The target INR range varies depending on the specific medical condition. For example, patients with atrial fibrillation may have a target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, while those with mechanical heart valves may require a higher range. Maintaining the INR within the target range is crucial for balancing bleeding and clotting risks. - **Dose adjustment:** If the INR is below the target range, the patient may be at risk for clot formation. In such cases, the physician may increase the anticoagulant dosage. Conversely, if the INR is above the target range, there is an increased risk of bleeding, and the dosage may be reduced or temporarily discontinued. - **Regular monitoring:** Patients on anticoagulant therapy require regular monitoring of their INR levels, especially when starting or changing medications or when changes occur in diet, lifestyle, or medication administration that could affect the anticoagulant's efficacy."

Regular monitoring helps to personalize treatment plans for optimal outcomes. In summary, the clinical significance of INR lies in its use as a tool for monitoring and adjusting anticoagulant therapy to prevent thromboembolic events while minimizing the risk of bleeding complications. Regular and careful monitoring of INR is essential for the safe and effective management of patients on anticoagulant medications. **D-Dimer**\nThe clinical significance of D-dimer lies in its association with various medical conditions, particularly those related to thrombosis and coagulation. However, it is often nonspecific. Here are some key points regarding the clinical significance of D-dimer:\n- **Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism:** Elevated D-dimer levels are commonly seen in conditions associated with the formation and breakdown of blood clots, such as DVT (blood clots in deep veins) and PE (blood clots that travel to the lungs). D-dimer testing is often used to support the diagnosis of suspected DVT or PE. High levels of D-dimer may prompt further imaging studies, such as ultrasound or CT scans, to confirm the presence of blood clots. D-dimer's clinical use lies primarily in the fact that a negative test, along with low pretest probability, can exclude patients who are considered low-risk for clots. - **Disseminated intravascular coagulation:** DIC is a serious condition where the blood clotting process is activated throughout the body, leading to widespread clot formation and consumption of clotting factors. This can result in bleeding complications. Elevated D-dimer levels are often seen in DIC, and D-dimer testing may be used to help diagnose and monitor this condition. - **Stroke and arterial thrombosis:** While D-dimer is more commonly associated with venous thrombosis, elevated levels may also be observed in certain arterial thrombotic events, such as stroke."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nWhen interpreting abnormal blood clotting study results, it's essential to consider the clinical context, medical history, and potential contributing factors. For example, a patient on anticoagulant therapy may have intentionally prolonged PT and INR values. Similarly, a patient with liver disease may exhibit abnormal PT and PTT due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors. Addressing abnormal values involves a multidisciplinary approach. In collaboration with other specialists, a hematologist can determine the underlying cause and develop a tailored treatment plan. This may include administering clotting factor concentrates, adjusting anticoagulant medications, or addressing the specific condition contributing to the abnormal clotting profile.\nBlood clotting studies provide valuable information about an individual's coagulation status, helping clinicians assess the risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Understanding the normal and abnormal values of PT, PTT, INR, and D-dimer is crucial for accurate interpretation and effective management of coagulation disorders. Regular monitoring and collaboration between healthcare professionals are key to ensuring optimal patient care and preventing complications associated with abnormal clotting."

    "text": "Introduction\nHemostasis is defined as the process of clot formation. It is divided into four stages. The first stage involves the creation of a platelet plug consequent from disruption of the vascular endothelium from injuries due to diabetes, hypertension, smoking as well as vascular wall tear. Following damage to the vascular wall, the Von Willibrand factor (VWF) is released by the endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, which mediates platelet adhesion to the damaged vascular surface, and aggregation of platelets. The second stage involves the propagation of clots by activation of various proenzymes to their active form. This clotting cascade is a regulatory process of the clotting system initiated by the extrinsic pathway and propagated via the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by factor 3 (tissue factor), a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is present in the subendothelial tissues and fibroblast. Tissue factor is activated by exposure from vascular disruption or damage. Exposed tissue factor binds to factor 7 and calcium, which then converts factor 10 to activated factor 10. The intrinsic pathway results from activation of factor 11 by factor 12, HMW Kininogen, and prekallikrein. Activated 11 then activates factor 9. Activated factor 9 in conjunction with its cofactor (factor 8), leads to the activation of factor 10. The coagulation cascade has a common pathway that bridges the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Activated factor 10 with its cofactor (factor 5) in conjunction with calcium, tissue, and platelet phospholipids, converts prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin breaks circulating fibrinogen to fibrin and activates factor 13, which crosslinks fibrin leading to a stable clot. The third stage in the clotting process is the termination of clot formation and the antithrombin control mechanism which are designed to prevent and mediate the extent of clot formation, thereby preventing processes that can lead to thrombosis, vascular inflammation, and tissue damage. This phase in the clotting pathway ensures the fluidity of blood."

    "text": "This phase in the clotting pathway ensures the fluidity of blood. Anatomy and Physiology\nAnticoagulants derive their effect by acting at different sites of the coagulation cascade. Some act directly by enzyme inhibition, while others indirectly, by binding to antithrombin or by preventing their synthesis from the liver (vitamin K dependent factors). **Available Anticoagulants**\n- **Unfractionated Heparin (UFH):** These include heparin, make complexes with antithrombin 3, and inactivates various clotting factors. Its onset of action is rapid, has a short half-life, and can be monitored using activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), activated clotting time, and anti-factor 10a activity. The recommended target ratio of aPTT is 1.5 to 2.2 times the patients' aPTT. - **Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH):** These are enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, nadroparin, have a longer length of action, long half-life, and can be monitored using anti-factor 10a activity. However, monitoring is not indicated except in certain conditions like pregnancy and renal failure. - **Vitamin K Dependent Antagonists (VKA):** Warfarin, one of the most common anticoagulants available. It acts by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), which is needed for the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent factors (factors 2, 7, 9, 10, protein C and S). It has a narrow therapeutic window of dosing, and its effect is profoundly altered by certain factors including diet (leafy green vegetables, fruits like avocado, kiwi), medications, and genetic mutations in the VKOR complex which leads to resistance. It requires frequent monitoring with an international normalized ratio (INR). - **Direct Thrombin Inhibitors:** Bivalirudin, argatroban, and dabigatran are direct thrombin inhibitors; these inhibit the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin. All products are renally metabolized. - **Direct Factor 10a Inhibitors:** These include rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban. Mechanism of action involves inhibition of the cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin by binding directly to factor 10a. These products are only orally administered."

Indications\n**Indications for Anticoagulation**\nThe choice of anticoagulation should be a shared decision and tailored to the patient's preference, risk stratification, and medical condition. Anticoagulants are indicated in several conditions listed below. The main indications for anticoagulation include atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and post-heart valve replacement. Venous thromboembolism is important because they sometimes are the first sign in multiple medical conditions. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**\nEarly anticoagulation (AC) with heparin is indicated for all patients with a documented diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. The choice of AC (heparin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, or bivalirudin) depends on the therapy instituted. AC has been found to lower the risk of thrombus formation when it started early and continued for more than 48 hours. Heparin (UFH) is indicated for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For those patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy, heparin is also indicated and continued for at least two days. Patients not undergoing PCI should be treated with low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin or parenteral heparin (UFH). **Left Ventricular (LV) Thrombus**\nStudies have suggested the benefits of early initiation of anticoagulation in patients with documented LV thrombus to prevent embolization of thrombus. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued for three to four months as the risk of embolization was found to be highest within the first 3-4 months. Although no extensive randomized studies have been conducted with the NOACs in this disease state, as compared to warfarin, it is recommended that NOACs be used due to the convenience of dosing. Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants like warfarin with a therapeutic target INR of 2-3, continue to be used most commonly."

Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants like warfarin with a therapeutic target INR of 2-3, continue to be used most commonly. **Atrial Fibrillation**\nAnticoagulation reduces the embolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The risk for embolization is the same for patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or chronic atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for stroke. It is present in approximately 20% of patients with a first-time stroke and contributes to increased mortality and disability. The embolic risk for patients with atrial fibrillation can be assessed using scoring systems like the CHA2DS2-VASc score. **Left Ventricular Aneurysm**\nA left ventricular aneurysm can be a complication of acute myocardial infarction. Patients with a left ventricular aneurysm are at high risk for a thromboembolic event. Among other medical therapies, anticoagulation reduces thromboembolic events, especially in those with arrhythmia. **Prosthetic Heart Valve**\nAnticoagulation therapy is indicated in patients with a prosthetic heart valve. Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants are recommended for patients with prosthetic heart valves in addition to the use of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin at any point when vitamin K antagonist therapy is interrupted. Direct oral anticoagulants are not indicated in patients with a prosthetic heart valve. The ideal level of vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants varies depending on the diseased valve and the presence of additional thromboembolic risk factors. **Venous Thromboembolism Treatment**\nAnticoagulation is used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli). The duration for anticoagulation in these clinical states depends on the precipitating circumstances, and additional thromboembolic risk and comorbidities. **Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis**\nAnticoagulants are indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in selected patient populations (hospitalized patients, post-operative state, cancer patients). Adverse events like thromboembolism are reduced in patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation. **Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer**\nThromboembolism is a frequent complication in cancer patients due to the release of procoagulants from neoplastic cells. Several studies have demonstrated that LMWH is superior to VKAs in the treatment of VTE in cancer patients."

Equipment\n**Laboratory Monitoring and Testing for Anticoagulation**\nMeasurement and monitoring of anticoagulation levels and concentrations may be indicated in certain situations like:\n1. Bleeding\n1. Thrombosis\n1. Urgent or elective invasive procedures\n1. Thrombolysis\n1. Overdose\n1. Therapeutic levels for multiple conditions\n1. Preoperative testing\n1. Liver disease\nRoutine monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) levels is not generally indicated unless in certain conditions with high bleeding risk, such as neural procedures that require no anticoagulant effect. Assays for anti-10a or anti-2a activity are recommended methods in these conditions for quantitative information. The initial testing in any individual with suspected bleeding history is listed below. Several point-of-care tests (POCT) for anticoagulation are used in operating rooms. POCT can measure bleedings assays like prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen assay, and whole blood platelet function test. - CBC with platelet count and morphology\n- Bleeding Time: An insensitive test that is not commonly in use. This test shows how quickly bleeding can stop. The test provides information on platelet disorder, vascular contractility, Von Willibrand disorder (VWD), and thrombocytopenia. - Clotting Time: This is the time it takes for plasma to clot after the addition of different substrates in vitro under standard conditions using the capillary method. The average clotting time is between 8 to 15 minutes. Some studies have disputed the use of clotting time as a screening test. - Prothrombin Time (PT)/INR: This is the initial test used to identify defects in secondary hemostasis. It is the time taken for blood to clot and generates thrombin."

Complications\n**Bleeding Risk on Anticoagulation**\nSeveral factors can increase the risk of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. The risks can be anticoagulant-related or patient-related. Providers need to consider other factors or errors that can increase the risk of bleeding in patients. **Anticoagulant-Related Risks**\n1. Studies have shown that the risk of significant bleed is higher with warfarin than with direct oral anticoagulants. 1. Dose of anticoagulant\n1. Concomitant use of other medications (e.g., antiplatelet agents) that independently increase the risk of bleeding\n**Patient-Related Risks**\n1. Age\n1. Race (risk increased in Black/Brown population)\n1. Underlying medical conditions\n1. Recent surgery\n1. Coagulopathy\n**Anticoagulation Reversal**\nThe initial step for any condition requiring urgent reversal of anticoagulation is always to discontinue the anticoagulant. Other standard measures that can be applied to most anticoagulants in certain significant and life-threatening bleeding situations include:\na) Use of activated charcoal with 2 hours of the last dose of anticoagulant\nb) Hemodialysis\nc) Red blood cell transfusion for anemia\nd) Platelet transfusion if thrombocytopenic\ne) Some cases may warrant surgical or endoscopic intervention\nDifferent anticoagulants have specific reversal agents that act to counteract their effects. 1. Unfractionated Heparin: Protamine sulfate counteracts the anti-10a activity of unfractionated heparin. Protamine sulfate has a short half-life and is usually administered intravenously. The ideal dose to achieve full resolution of anti-10a action can be calculated by 1 mg/100units of heparin remaining in the blood. The amount of heparin remaining in the blood can be estimated based on the previous dose of heparin, the interval since the last treatment, considering its half-life of one to two hours (doses of 50mg or 25mg via slow intravenous infusion). 1."

Clinical Significance\n**Bridging Anticoagulation**\nPerioperative and periprocedural anticoagulation management is a constant clinical dilemma for providers. Estimation of the risk of thromboembolism, bleeding, and timing of anticoagulation should be considered for patients undergoing elective procedures. Bridging anticoagulation, most commonly with low molecular weight heparin, should be considered in cases with considerable risk of thromboembolic events. For patients with low risk, bridging anticoagulation is not indicated. However, for patients with significant risk, bridging anticoagulation is indicated.[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243278) The American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and HRS (Heart Rhythm Society) recommendations are considered.\n**Initiating Anticoagulation Treatment with Warfarin**\n- Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: No bridging with heparin product is indicated when initiating therapy with warfarin for patients with uncomplicated nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Bridging anticoagulation is not recommended for patients at low or moderate risk for thromboembolism.\n- Mechanical Heart Valve: Bridging with heparin is indicated for patients with a mechanical heart valve.\n- Recent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or Active Arterial Thromboembolism (TE): Bridging anticoagulation with a heparin product is indicated when initiating treatment for recent pulmonary emboli\n- Coronary stenting within 12 weeks\n**Bridging Overlap**\nTherapeutic doses of the direct oral anticoagulants are achieved within two to three hours of initiating treatment, and bridging therapy with heparin may be discontinued.\nFor oral Vitamin K antagonists, bridging overlap may last for up to 4 to 5 days before achieving a therapeutic level."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe perioperative management of anticoagulation for hospitalized and ambulatory adult patients on anticoagulation for various reasons requires expert clinical judgment tailored to the patients' needs. The decision to hold, bridge, or resume anticoagulant therapy for a patient is based on the patient's clinical condition, and established guidelines. This article focuses on recommendations formulated to assist providers in developing periprocedural antithrombotic management plans.\nWhen managing surgical patients on chronic anticoagulation, providers must address the estimated risk of thromboembolism, bleeding, the timing of anticoagulation, and if anticoagulation bridging is necessary.\nPatients with mitral valve prosthesis, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and pulmonary embolism (PE), have a higher estimated risk for thromboembolic events and may benefit from a delay in planned surgical intervention. When considering patients with more than one predisposing thromboembolic risk, it is recommended that the condition with the highest thromboembolic risk receive precedence.\nThe consequences of a significant thromboembolic event for patients with estimated high risk are more long-lasting when compared to the effects of a major bleed. The patient's risk for a thromboembolic event is increased depending on the interval since diagnosis, the number of predisposing conditions, and age. Patients with recent CVA or PE are likely to benefit from a delay in surgical interventions until the risk reverts to baseline.\n**Duration of Anticoagulation Therapy**\nTreatment duration with anticoagulation should be individualized based on recurrence and risk of bleeding.\n- When the first episode of venous thromboembolism (provoked or unprovoked), treatment for a minimum of 3 months.\n- Persisting or reversible risk factor, treatment may be extended to 6 or 12 months.\n- If unprovoked proximal DVT and symptomatic PE, indefinite anticoagulation for life.\n- When recurrent venous thromboembolism with or without anticoagulation, indefinite anticoagulation for life."

    "text": "History and Physical\nComponents of a patient\u2019s history that may be consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation include a recent history of severe infections or trauma as well as hepatic failure, obstetric complications, and malignancy. A remote history of deep vein or arterial thrombosis may also suggest DIC. Patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites, including the gingiva, areas of trauma or surgery, the vagina, the rectum, or through devices such as urinary catheters. Symptoms such as hematuria, oliguria, and anuria may be seen if concomitant renal failure from DIC results. Likewise, end-organ damage to the lungs may lead to dyspnea and hemoptysis if pulmonary hemorrhage or pulmonary embolism occurs, and a patient may have a mental status change if either thrombi or hemorrhage to areas of the brain arise. A patient could also experience chest pain if arterial occlusion of a coronary artery develops. Regarding signs of DIC on physical exam, obvious bleeding or frank hemorrhage in various areas of the body may be noted. Skin lesions, including ecchymosis, hematomas, jaundice from liver failure, necrosis, and gangrene, may also arise. Excessive coagulation may lead to widespread purpura, petechiae, and cyanosis. A patient in DIC may also experience acute respiratory failure or neurological deficits based on the location of bleeding or clots."

A patient in DIC may also experience acute respiratory failure or neurological deficits based on the location of bleeding or clots. Treatment / Management\nThe treatment for DIC centers on addressing the underlying disorder that ultimately led to this condition. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and consideration for exploratory surgical intervention in trauma-related cases represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. A common threshold utilized for platelet transfusions in this patient population is less than 50 x 109 platelets/L for actively hemorrhaging patients and 10-20 x 109 platelets/L for those not actively bleeding but at high risk of future bleeding.\nLikewise, fresh frozen plasma, typically at 15 mL/kg to 30 mL/kg, and cryoprecipitate can be transfused to replenish coagulation factors. Prothrombin complex concentrate may also be considered; however, this formulation only contains some coagulation factors and will only mildly correct a patient\u2019s hemostasis. Heparin may also become necessary if a patient has extensive clotting, as this medication may prevent further activation of the clotting cascade. Patients with DIC who are not actively bleeding should receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin."
