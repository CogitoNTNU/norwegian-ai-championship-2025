The clinical presentation of the condition varies widely, from mild or asymptomatic cases to life-threatening respiratory failure. Pneumothorax is classified into 3 main categories\u2014spontaneous, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax can occur without an external cause and is further divided into primary and secondary. Traumatic pneumothorax results from blunt or penetrating chest injuries, including medical procedures such as lung biopsy or central venous catheter placement. The most critical form, tension pneumothorax, is a rapidly progressive emergency where trapped air causes mediastinal shift and hemodynamic instability, requiring immediate needle decompression.\nThis activity reviews an in-depth review of the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of acute pneumothorax. The activity covers modern diagnostic tools, including radiology advancements, and outlines conservative and interventional treatment options. In addition, it emphasizes the vital role of the interprofessional healthcare team, including emergency physicians, thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists, in ensuring timely recognition and optimal patient outcomes.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify the clinical signs and symptoms of pneumothorax.\n- Assess imaging studies, such as chest x-rays and ultrasound, for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of pneumothorax progression.\n- Apply evidence-based guidelines to determine when conservative management or surgical intervention is necessary.\n- Collaborate with emergency physicians, thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists to optimize patient outcomes."

Introduction\nPneumothorax refers to the presence of air or gas within the pleural space\u2014the space between the visceral and parietal pleura of the thoracic cavity. This accumulation can disrupt normal lung expansion, impairing ventilation and oxygenation. The clinical presentations of pneumothorax range from asymptomatic to a life-threatening emergency, depending on factors such as the volume of air, the rate of accumulation, and the patient's underlying respiratory status.\nPneumothorax is categorized into 3 broad types based on its etiology and pathophysiology\u2014spontaneous, traumatic, and tension. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without an apparent external cause and is further divided into primary and secondary types. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax develops in individuals without underlying lung disease, most commonly in young, tall, thin males with subclinical pleural blebs. In contrast, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with preexisting lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary fibrosis.\nTraumatic pneumothorax occurs due to blunt or penetrating chest trauma, including rib fractures, gunshot wounds, or iatrogenic causes, such as lung biopsy, central venous catheter placement, or mechanical ventilation. Tension pneumothorax is a rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition in which trapped air accumulates under pressure, leading to severe respiratory distress, mediastinal shift, and hemodynamic instability. Immediate needle thoracostomy is required for decompression, followed by definitive chest tube placement."

Immediate needle thoracostomy is required for decompression, followed by definitive chest tube placement. Etiology\nTraditionally, pneumothorax is divided into primary or secondary based on its etiology. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is more common in men and is frequently associated with underlying lung disease and smoking. However, this simplified classification has become less accurate, as advancements in diagnostic techniques have revealed that many cases previously classified as primary are associated with secondary causes, such as parenchyma disorders, emphysema, or smoking-related lung disease. Studies conducted in the United Kingdom have identified COPD as the leading cause of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, accounting for 70% to 80% of all cases. Tobacco smoking is recognized as the primary risk factor for primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as it increases the likelihood of pneumothorax due to its harmful effects on lung parenchyma. In addition to traditional tobacco use, emerging evidence suggests that other forms of smoking, including cannabis use and vaping, may also contribute to the development of spontaneous pneumothorax. In addition to smoke-related risks, secondary pneumothorax can also result from lung malignancies, infections\u2014such as _Pneumocystis_ _jirovecii_ \u2014and, more recently, severe cases of COVID-19. Pneumothorax is broadly classified into 3 broad categories based on its etiology:\n- Traumatic pneumothorax: Results from blunt or penetrating chest trauma, such as rib fractures and gunshot wounds. - Iatrogenic pneumothorax: A subtype of traumatic pneumothorax caused by medical interventions, such as central line insertion, thoracentesis, device implantation, computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation or resuscitation. - Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs without external trauma and is divided into 2 categories."

Pneumothorax can also be classified into 4 categories based on its physiological impact:\n- Simple pneumothorax\n- No communication with the outside atmosphere\n- No mediastinal or diaphragmatic shift\n- Example: A pleural laceration from a fractured rib\n- Communicating pneumothorax\n- Occurs when a defect in the chest wall creates an open connection between the pleura space and the external environment, such as a gunshot wound\n- Results in paradoxical lung collapse and severe ventilatory impairment\n- Tension pneumothorax\n- Progressive air accumulation in the pleural cavity leads to:\n- Mediastinal shift to the opposite side\n- Compression of the vena cava and great vessels, reducing diastolic filling\n- Compromised cardiac output, leading to hemodynamic instability\n- Occurs when a one-way valve effect traps air in the pleural space, preventing its escape. - Catamenial pneumothorax\n- A rare, nontraumatic pneumothorax that occurs in women of childbearing age, typically within 3 to 4 days after menstruation onset\n- Often affects the right lung. - Believed to be caused by pleural endometriosis, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Other causes of pneumothorax include barotrauma, occurring from scuba diving or air travel, especially in individuals with preexisting lung disease. In addition, individuals with underlying lung cysts or bullae are at an increased risk of developing pneumothorax in response to rapid pressure changes."

In addition, individuals with underlying lung cysts or bullae are at an increased risk of developing pneumothorax in response to rapid pressure changes. History and Physical\nThe clinical presentation of pneumothorax varies depending on its size and etiology. Some patients may be asymptomatic, and the condition may be diagnosed incidentally during the imaging performed for an unrelated reason. The most common symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath, reported in 64% to 85% of cases. Chest pain is typically sudden, unilateral (though rarely bilateral), sharp or stabbing, pleuritic, and may radiate to the ipsilateral shoulder or arm. The severity of symptoms varies, depending on the extent of the lung collapse. In cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, symptoms may gradually improve after 24 hours, possibly due to the spontaneous reabsorption of air from the pleural space. Other possible symptoms include anxiety and cough, though these are less common. Physical examination findings depend on the size of the pneumothorax. In small pneumothoraces, the exam may be entirely normal. However, the affected side may have absent breath sounds in larger pneumothoraces. Many patients experiencing a first-time spontaneous pneumothorax may delay seeking medical attention for several days. Hypoxia (oxygen saturation below 90%) is rare, occurring in only 3% to 11% of cases. **Tension Pneumothorax**\nTension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention. In addition to chest pain and shortness of breath, patients with tension pneumothorax exhibit hemodynamic compromise, which can include profound hypoxia and hypotension. The pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax involves the gradual accumulation of air in the pleural space caused by a one-valve effect that prevents air from escaping. The increasing intrapleural pressure leads to a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, compression of the vena cava, and decreased cardiac output, ultimately resulting in severe hypotension and hypoxia."

Evaluation\nThe diagnosis of pneumothorax is based on a combination of patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, with chest x-rays being the primary imaging modality (see **Image. ** Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax). However, small pneumothoraces are often missed on physical examination and chest x-rays and may be detected incidentally on CT scans performed for other indications (see **Image. ** Rib Fracture). In cases of moderate-to-severe pneumothorax, arterial blood gas analysis may reveal hypoxia and, in patients with underlying COPD, occasional hypercapnia. Spontaneous pneumothorax should always be considered when diagnosing patients with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. Similarly, traumatic pneumothorax must be suspected in any case of blunt or penetrating chest trauma. The diagnostic approach varies depending on the clinical scenario. An upright chest radiograph is typically the preferred initial imaging study. However, tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, as waiting for imaging can delay life-saving treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly used to evaluate pneumothorax. This modality offers greater accuracy compared to chest x-rays while avoiding radiation exposure. Ultrasound is particularly valuable in critically ill patients and situations requiring rapid bedside assessment. **Classification Based on Size**\nThe distinction between small and large pneumothoraces is based on the distance between the lung margin and the chest wall on imaging:\n- Small pneumothorax: Visible rim less than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. - Large pneumothorax: Visible rim greater than 2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall. Chest x-rays underestimate the size of pneumothorax and may also reveal other findings, such as hydropneumothorax (air and fluid levels in the pleural space), particularly when obtained in the upright position."

Chest x-rays underestimate the size of pneumothorax and may also reveal other findings, such as hydropneumothorax (air and fluid levels in the pleural space), particularly when obtained in the upright position. Treatment / Management\nThe management of pneumothorax is guided by its etiology, clinical presentation, and risk stratification. The key treatment principles include eliminating air from the pleural space, reducing air leakage, promoting pleural healing, facilitating lung reexpansion, and preventing recurrence. **Asymptomatic Patients**\nAsymptomatic Patients with an incidentally discovered pneumothorax may not require intervention unless they are at high risk of recurrence. Typically, this decision is not made in the emergency department; instead, these patients should be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and care. **Symptomatic Patients**\nFor symptomatic patients with stable vital signs, initial management may include needle aspiration or small-bore catheter insertion (pigtail catheter) in the emergency department. Evidence suggests that needle aspiration is as safe and effective as tube thoracostomy in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. A recent randomized clinical trial involving unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax revealed that conservative observation was not inferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events compared to invasive techniques. These patients may require hospital admission for observation. Although oxygen therapy with serial chest radiographs is sometimes used, there are limited supporting data. Importantly, positive pressure-generating therapies, such as noninvasive ventilation or high nasal flow nasal cannula, should not be used due to the risk of air leaks and worsening pneumothorax. For secondary secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation or needle aspiration is typically insufficient. These cases require hospital admission and chest tube insertion (ranging from 20 to 28 French), which is typically connected to a water-seal device with or without additional suctioning. **Management of Unstable Patients**\nPatients with traumatic or tension pneumothorax require emergent thoracostomy or chest tube placement."

In most cases, non-tension pneumothorax can be effectively managed with small-bore pigtail catheters inserted using the Seldinger technique. Very large pneumothoraces may necessitate large-bore chest tubes. A thoracostomy with a large-bore chest tube insertion is necessary if there is a concomitant hemothorax. Studies have shown that simple aspiration has a higher failure rate compared to chest tube drainage when used as the initial management strategy for complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases. As a result, chest tube placement is often preferred in patients with large or recurrent pneumothoraces to ensure adequate lung reexpansion and reduce the risk of early recurrence. **Air Drainage Techniques**\nAir drainage techniques are essential in managing pneumothorax. These techniques help remove air from the pleural space, facilitate lung reexpansion, and prevent recurrence. The choice of technique depends on the size of the pneumothorax, the patient's clinical stability, and the underlying etiology. - Needle aspiration technique: A large-bore (14-gauge) needle approximately 10 cm long can be inserted at one of 2 locations (see **Image. ** Chest Wall Decompression.) - Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, above the superior edge of the third rib\n- Fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, above the upper border of the sixth rib\nThis placement method aims to prevent injury to the neurovascular bundle, which runs along the inferior edge of each rib. - Large-bore catheter drainage technique: For cases requiring large-bore catheter drainage, an 8.3-French pigtail catheter can be introduced into the pleural cavity using ultrasound. Similar to needle aspiration, there are multiple insertion points. - Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line\n- Fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, ensuring placement above the superior rib edge to minimize the risk of neurovascular bundle injury. **Special Considerations in Pneumothorax Management**\nThe management of pneumothorax in special populations requires specific considerations."

In pregnant women, nearly 50% of pneumothorax cases resolve with conservative observation, and fetal complications remain below 5%. Patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, even if asymptomatic, should be educated about the risk of pneumothorax, particularly during pregnancy, and should seek immediate medical attention if symptoms arise. Throughout pregnancy, patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis should be co-managed by a pulmonologist and an obstetrician with expertise. For patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who have a high risk of recurrence, 2 surgical approaches have demonstrated comparable effectiveness:\n- Thoracic pleurodesis using pleural abrasion with minocycline pleurodesis\n- Apical pleurectomy\nBoth techniques effectively prevent recurrence and are viable management options for high-risk individuals. **Pharmacological Management and Pain Control**\nPharmacotherapy for pneumothorax primarily focuses on pain control, both from the pneumothorax itself and procedures such as thoracostomy or needle aspiration. Pain control can be achieved through:\n- Local anesthetic infiltration at the thoracostomy site\n- Intravenous or oral pain medications\n- Regional anesthesia techniques, such as intercostal nerve blocks\nFor patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for pneumothorax, intercostal nerve blocks are as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia in managing postoperative pain, with the added benefit of improved patient mobility. In addition, intercostal nerve blocks are associated with fewer systemic adverse effects, such as hypotension and urinary retention, making them a safer and more convenient option for pain management in these patients. During chest tube insertion, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered to prevent insertion site infections and to reduce the risk of complications, such as empyema. These antibiotics can also be used for patients requiring prolonged chest tube placement."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nPneumothorax is a common condition, with over 5 million intensive care unit admissions in the United States annually. Managing this condition requires a coordinated interprofessional team, including emergency department physicians, general surgeons, thoracic surgeons, critical care specialists, radiologists, and specialty-trained emergency or critical care nurses. Nurses play a crucial role in patient monitoring after chest tube placement, ensuring proper wound care, assessing breath sounds, and maintaining the patency of the drainage system. Any abnormalities must be promptly reported to the team.\nEarly recognition of tension pneumothorax by nurses is crucial, as it can rapidly lead to deterioration in a patient's condition. As frontline providers, they must be prepared to notify the clinical team immediately and assist in emergency interventions.\nAlthough chest x-ray remains the standard diagnostic tool, advancements in radiology software have improved detection, particularly for less experienced practitioners. Effective management relies on a well-trained, interprofessional team with clear and rapid communication, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes."

The recurrence rate is highest over the first 30 days.\nSecondary spontaneous pneumothorax is seen more in old-age patients 60-65 years. The incidence of SSP is 6.3 and 2 cases for men and women per 100,000 patients, respectively. The male-to-female ratio is 3:1. COPD has an incidence of 26 pneumothoraces per 100,000 patients. The risk of spontaneous pneumothorax in heavy smokers is 102 times higher than in non-smokers.\nThe leading cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax is transthoracic needle aspiration (usually for biopsies), and the second leading cause is central venous catheterization. These occur more frequently than spontaneous pneumothorax, and their number increases as intensive care modalities advance. The incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax is 5 per 10,000 admissions in the hospital.\nThe incidence of tension pneumothorax is challenging to determine as one-third of cases in trauma centers have decompressive needle thoracostomies before reaching the hospital, and not all of these had tension pneumothorax.\nPneumomediastinum has an incidence of 1 case per 10,000 admissions in the hospital."

Pneumomediastinum has an incidence of 1 case per 10,000 admissions in the hospital. Pathophysiology\nThe pressure gradient inside the thorax changes with a pneumothorax. Usually, the pressure of the pleural space is negative when compared to atmospheric pressure. When the chest wall expands outwards, the lung also expands outwards due to surface tension between the parietal and visceral pleurae. Lungs tend to collapse due to elastic recoil. When there is communication between the alveoli and the pleural space, air fills this space changing the gradient, lung collapse unit equilibrium is achieved, or the rupture is sealed. Pneumothorax enlarges, and the lung gets smaller due to this vital capacity, and oxygen partial pressure decreases. Clinical presentation of a pneumothorax can range anywhere from asymptomatic to chest pain and shortness of breath. A tension pneumothorax can cause severe hypotension (obstructive shock) and even death. Increased central venous pressure can result in distended neck veins and hypotension. Patients may have tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Spontaneous pneumothorax in most patients occurs due to the rupture of bullae or blebs. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is defined as occurring in patients without underlying lung disease, but these patients had asymptomatic bullae or blebs on thoracotomy. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in tall and thin young people due to increased shear forces or more negative pressure at the apex of the lung. Lung inflammation and oxidative stress are essential to the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Current smokers have increased inflammatory cells in small airways and are at increased risk of pneumothorax. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the presence of underlying lung disease, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; others may include tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, malignancy, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia."

However, it is essential to make the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax on a physical exam. Treatment / Management\nManagement depends on the clinical scenario. For patients with associated symptoms and showing signs of instability, needle decompression is the treatment of a pneumothorax. This usually is performed with a 14- to 16-gauge and 4.5 cm in length angiocatheter, just superior to the rib in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. After needle decompression or stable pneumothoraces, the treatment is inserting a thoracostomy tube. This usually is placed above the rib in the fifth intercostal space anterior to the midaxillary line. The size of the thoracostomy tube usually ranges depending on the patient's height and weight and whether there is an associated hemothorax. Open \"sucking\" chest wounds are treated initially with a three-sided occlusive dressing. Further treatment may require tube thoracostomy and chest wall defect repair. In an asymptomatic small primary spontaneous pneumothorax (depth less than 2cm), the patient is usually discharged with follow-up in outpatient after 2-4 weeks. If the patient is symptomatic or the depth/size is more than 2cm, needle aspiration is done; after aspiration, if the patient improves and residual depth is less than 2cm, then the patient is discharged; otherwise, tube thoracostomy is done. In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, if the size/depth of pneumothorax is less than 1cm and there is no dyspnea, the patient is admitted, high-flow oxygen is given, and observation is done for 24 hours. If size/ depth is between 1-2cm, needle aspiration is done, then the residual size of pneumothorax is seen; if the depth after the needle aspiration is less than 1cm, management is done with oxygen inhalation and observation, and in case of more than 2cm, tube thoracostomy is done. In case of depth more than 2cm or breathlessness, a tube thoracostomy is done."

    "text": "Epidemiology\nPrimary spontaneous pneumothorax mainly occurs at 20-30 years of age. The incidence of PSP in the United States is 7 per 100,000 men and 1 per 100,000 women per year. Most recurrence occurs within the first year, and incidence ranges widely from 25% to 50%. The recurrence rate is highest over the first 30 days.\nSecondary spontaneous pneumothorax is seen more in old-age patients 60-65 years. The incidence of SSP is 6.3 and 2 cases for men and women per 100,000 patients, respectively. The male-to-female ratio is 3:1. COPD has an incidence of 26 pneumothoraces per 100,000 patients. The risk of spontaneous pneumothorax in heavy smokers is 102 times higher than in non-smokers.\nThe leading cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax is transthoracic needle aspiration (usually for biopsies), and the second leading cause is central venous catheterization. These occur more frequently than spontaneous pneumothorax, and their number increases as intensive care modalities advance. The incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax is 5 per 10,000 admissions in the hospital.\nThe incidence of tension pneumothorax is challenging to determine as one-third of cases in trauma centers have decompressive needle thoracostomies before reaching the hospital, and not all of these had tension pneumothorax.\nPneumomediastinum has an incidence of 1 case per 10,000 admissions in the hospital."

Pneumomediastinum has an incidence of 1 case per 10,000 admissions in the hospital. Pathophysiology\nThe pressure gradient inside the thorax changes with a pneumothorax. Usually, the pressure of the pleural space is negative when compared to atmospheric pressure. When the chest wall expands outwards, the lung also expands outwards due to surface tension between the parietal and visceral pleurae. Lungs tend to collapse due to elastic recoil. When there is communication between the alveoli and the pleural space, air fills this space changing the gradient, lung collapse unit equilibrium is achieved, or the rupture is sealed. Pneumothorax enlarges, and the lung gets smaller due to this vital capacity, and oxygen partial pressure decreases. Clinical presentation of a pneumothorax can range anywhere from asymptomatic to chest pain and shortness of breath. A tension pneumothorax can cause severe hypotension (obstructive shock) and even death. Increased central venous pressure can result in distended neck veins and hypotension. Patients may have tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Spontaneous pneumothorax in most patients occurs due to the rupture of bullae or blebs. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is defined as occurring in patients without underlying lung disease, but these patients had asymptomatic bullae or blebs on thoracotomy. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in tall and thin young people due to increased shear forces or more negative pressure at the apex of the lung. Lung inflammation and oxidative stress are essential to the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Current smokers have increased inflammatory cells in small airways and are at increased risk of pneumothorax. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the presence of underlying lung disease, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; others may include tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, malignancy, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia."

Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the presence of underlying lung disease, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; others may include tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, malignancy, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. History and Physical\nIn primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the patient is minimally symptomatic, as otherwise healthy individuals tolerate physiologic consequences well. The most common symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath. The chest pain is pleuritic, sharp, severe, and radiates to the ipsilateral shoulder. In SSP, dyspnea is more potent because of decreased underlying lung reserve.\nThe history of pneumothorax in the past is essential as recurrence is seen in 15-40% of cases. Recurrence on the contralateral side can also occur.\nOn examination, the following findings are noted\n- Respiratory discomfort\n- Increased respiratory rate\n- Asymmetrical lung expansion\n- Decreased tactile fremitus\n- Hyperresonant percussion note\n- Decreased intensity of breath sounds or absent breath sounds\nIn tension pneumothorax following additional findings are seen\n- Tachycardia of more than 134 beats per minute\n- Hypotension\n- Jugular venous distension\n- Cyanosis\n- Respiratory failure\n- Cardiac arrest\nSome traumatic pneumothoraces are associated with subcutaneous emphysema. Pneumothorax may be difficult to diagnose from a physical exam, especially in a noisy trauma bay. However, it is essential to make the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax on a physical exam."

However, it is essential to make the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax on a physical exam. Treatment / Management\nManagement depends on the clinical scenario. For patients with associated symptoms and showing signs of instability, needle decompression is the treatment of a pneumothorax. This usually is performed with a 14- to 16-gauge and 4.5 cm in length angiocatheter, just superior to the rib in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. After needle decompression or stable pneumothoraces, the treatment is inserting a thoracostomy tube. This usually is placed above the rib in the fifth intercostal space anterior to the midaxillary line. The size of the thoracostomy tube usually ranges depending on the patient's height and weight and whether there is an associated hemothorax. Open \"sucking\" chest wounds are treated initially with a three-sided occlusive dressing. Further treatment may require tube thoracostomy and chest wall defect repair. In an asymptomatic small primary spontaneous pneumothorax (depth less than 2cm), the patient is usually discharged with follow-up in outpatient after 2-4 weeks. If the patient is symptomatic or the depth/size is more than 2cm, needle aspiration is done; after aspiration, if the patient improves and residual depth is less than 2cm, then the patient is discharged; otherwise, tube thoracostomy is done. In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, if the size/depth of pneumothorax is less than 1cm and there is no dyspnea, the patient is admitted, high-flow oxygen is given, and observation is done for 24 hours. If size/ depth is between 1-2cm, needle aspiration is done, then the residual size of pneumothorax is seen; if the depth after the needle aspiration is less than 1cm, management is done with oxygen inhalation and observation, and in case of more than 2cm, tube thoracostomy is done. In case of depth more than 2cm or breathlessness, a tube thoracostomy is done."

    "text": "In case of depth more than 2cm or breathlessness, a tube thoracostomy is done. Air can reabsorb from the pleural space at a rate of 1.5%/day. Using supplemental oxygen can increase this reabsorption rate. By increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen concentration, the nitrogen of atmospheric air is displaced, changing the pressure gradient between the air in the pleural space and the capillaries. Pneumothorax on chest radiography approximately 25% or larger usually needs treatment with needle aspiration if symptomatic, and if it fails, then tube thoracostomy is done. **Indications for surgical intervention(VATS vs. thoracotomy)**\n- Continuous air leak for longer than seven days\n- Bilateral pneumothoraces\n- The first episode in high-risk profession patients, i.e., Divers, pilots\n- Recurrent ipsilateral pneumothorax\n- Contralateral pneumothorax\n- Patients who have AIDS\nPatients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) get pleurodesis to occlude pleural space. Mechanical pleurodesis with bleb/bullectomy decreases the recurrence rate of pneumothorax to \\<5%. Options for mechanical pleurodesis include stripping the parietal pleura versus using an abrasive \"scratchpad\" or dry gauze. A chemical pleurodesis is an option for patients who may not tolerate mechanical pleurodesis. Options for chemical pleurodesis include talc, tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline, all irritants to the pleural lining."
