    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis is a severe, life-threatening inflammation of the gallbladder that occurs in the absence of gallstones and primarily affects critically ill, older, and frail patients with multiple comorbidities. Unlike the more common calculous cholecystitis caused by gallstones, acalculous cholecystitis results from gallbladder stasis, cholestasis, and hypoperfusion, often due to prolonged fasting, total parenteral nutrition, or rapid weight loss. Due to its often vague presentation and rapid progression, acute acalculous cholecystitis poses significant diagnostic and management challenges.\nCommon symptoms include right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and a positive Murphy's sign. Diagnosis may be challenging as patients often present with other severe conditions. This course explores the roles and responsibilities of the interprofessional team in optimizing patient-centered care, including ICU monitoring, supportive care, percutaneous drainage, antibiotic therapy, surgical interventions, and strategies to improve patient outcomes. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in identifying acute acalculous cholecystitis, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional approach when managing this condition to reduce morbidity and mortality while improving functional outcomes for this vulnerable patient population.\n**Objectives:**\n- Determine the risk factors associated with the development of acalculous cholecystitis.\n- Assess the clinical features of acalculous cholecystitis.\n- Implement the appropriate treatment approach for a patient with acalculous cholecystitis.\n- Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients with acalculous cholecystitis."

Etiology\nGallbladder dysfunction in the absence of gallstones has a multifactorial etiology. Long periods of fasting, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and drastic weight loss can all increase the incidence of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Often, other more serious conditions are present. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) recovering from major surgeries or other life-threatening ailments, eg, a stroke, heart attack, sepsis, severe burns, and extensive trauma, are all at a higher risk of developing acute acalculous cholecystitis.\nGallbladder stasis can develop due to a lack of gallbladder stimulation by cholecystokinin (CCK), leading to the concentration of bile salts and increased pressure within the gallbladder. The elevated pressure leads to hypoperfusion and ischemia of the gallbladder wall that eventually causes pressure necrosis and perforation if prompt intervention is not initiated. This static condition also increases the seeding and growth of common enteric pathogens, eg, _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus faecali_ s.\nIndividuals with chronic acalculous cholecystitis may have decreased gallbladder emptying or hypokinetic biliary dyskinesia due to a variety of factors, including hormone imbalance, vasculitis, and decreased nerve innervation secondary to conditions such as diabetes. Often, the exact etiology of chronic acalculous cholecystitis is unknown."

    "text": "Often, the exact etiology of chronic acalculous cholecystitis is unknown. Pathophysiology\nThe pathogenesis of acute acalculous cholecystitis is complex, with the interplay of several mechanisms. Prolonged fasting and long-term TPN seen in critically ill patients can lead to biliary stasis within the gallbladder due to the lack of CCK stimulation. Stasis of the gallbladder results in the build-up of intraluminal pressure against the gallbladder wall and distention. The gallbladder wall develops an inflammatory reaction, characterized by significant thickening and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Prolonged biliary stasis can lead to bacterial colonization, contributing to the inflammatory response. If the pressure is not relieved promptly, the gallbladder wall loses its primary source of blood supply from the cystic artery, which is prone to ischemia. Progressive gallbladder wall ischemia will result in necrotic or gangrenous changes. A necrotic gallbladder wall will eventually perforate and stimulate a systemic inflammatory response, followed by sepsis and shock.\nChronic acalculous cholecystitis usually presents more insidiously. Symptoms are more prolonged and may be less severe. Symptoms may also be more intermittent and vague, although patients can present with signs of acute biliary colic. Although acute acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with critical illness, several mechanisms have been reported in patients without critical illness, including gallbladder vasculitis, biliary tree obstruction, and bile acid sequestration.\n**Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis** **Types**\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis can be divided into the following 4 types:\n1. Uncomplicated cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation without necrosis or perforation)\n1. Acute suppurative cholecystitis (an inflamed gallbladder with associated purulence)\n1. Gangrenous cholecystitis (gallbladder wall necrosis)\n1. Perforated cholecystitis (gallbladder wall rupture)"

Gangrenous cholecystitis (gallbladder wall necrosis)\n1. Perforated cholecystitis (gallbladder wall rupture) Histopathology\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis may present with varying degrees of inflammation, and the findings are similar to those of calculus cholecystitis but without gallstones. The gallbladder wall will be thickened to variable degrees, and there may be adhesions to the serosal surface. Smooth muscle hypertrophy, especially in chronic conditions, is often present. At times, sludge or viscous bile can be seen. These findings can be precursors to gallstone formation due to increased bile salts or stasis.\nVarious species of bacteria can be present in 11% to 30% of cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, also known as adenomyomatosis, are often present in specimens of chronic cholecystitis. These are herniations of intraluminal sinuses from increased intraluminal pressure, possibly associated with ducts of Luschka, which are small aberrant bile ducts found along the gallbladder fossa. The gallbladder mucosa will exhibit varying degrees of inflammation, from mild to moderate ulcerations with gangrenous changes. Extreme situations may show total gangrenous changes of the gallbladder with perforation."

Extreme situations may show total gangrenous changes of the gallbladder with perforation. Evaluation\n**Laboratory Studies**\nPreliminary laboratory studies typically include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and lipase levels. Findings of leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin, are common.\n**Ultrasound Imaging**\nUltrasound is usually the initial image obtained, as this can be completed at the bedside in a timely fashion and is cost-effective. Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm, gallbladder wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid are indicative of cholecystitis (see **Image**. Acalculous Cholecystitis).\n**Additional Diagnostic Studies**\nThe test of choice for diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of a normal ultrasound is a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, which may be done in conjunction with administration of CCK. A HIDA scan evaluates the function or ejection fraction of the gallbladder. After the radionuclide is administered, CCK is given to stimulate gallbladder emptying.\nA calculated ejection fraction of \u226435% may be indicative of hypokinetic functioning of the gallbladder. HIDA scan may also demonstrate no filling of the gallbladder with radiotracer material, indicative of cystic duct obstruction and acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen with intravenous contrast may also reveal gallbladder wall thickening, edema, and pericholecystic fluid in the absence of gallstones and sludge."

Treatment / Management\n**Stabalization and Antibiotic Therapy**\nPatients with acute acalculous cholecystitis should receive appropriate fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics that provide coverage for gram-negative rods and anaerobes, ideally after blood cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics alone are usually ineffective as they inadequately penetrate the pressurized gallbladder. Individuals requiring ICU-level care should be properly stabilized before undergoing operative intervention. **Percutaneous Cholecystostomy Tube and Stent Placement**\nIn those patients who are too unstable to undergo surgery, clinicians should consider interventional radiology consultation for percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. Percutaneous drainage is often the definitive treatment because acute acalculous cholecystitis has a lower recurrence rate when compared to acute calculous cholecystitis. The cholecystostomy tube can be removed after 3 weeks. After percutaneous drainage and recovery, outpatient tube studies by interventional radiology can confirm patency of the cystic duct before removal. Alternatively, the patient can undergo cholecystectomy between 4 and 8 weeks after tube placement. Another treatment option is cystic duct stent placement via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to decompress the gallbladder and prevent cystic duct obstruction. However, this approach is not as widely available as percutaneous cholecystostomy, and outcomes have not been studied as extensively. **Surgical Management**\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred definitive approach. However, an open cholecystectomy can also be performed if a contraindication to a minimally invasive approach is identified. Acute acalculous cholecystitis must be addressed fairly urgently because rapid progression and deterioration may result if left untreated. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is treated similarly to chronic calculous cholecystitis with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A robotic approach should be considered depending on the surgeon's experience."

Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is treated similarly to chronic calculous cholecystitis with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A robotic approach should be considered depending on the surgeon's experience. Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care\nMost patients can be discharged home the same day or the day after cholecystectomy. Depending on whether the gallbladder was gangrenous or perforated, antibiotics may be warranted postoperatively.\nOver-the-counter analgesics usually provide adequate pain control, but a short course of narcotics can be considered. Complaints of shoulder pain following laparoscopic surgery, which is caused by referred pain from the diaphragm and retained CO2 gas, are common. However, this pain typically resolves over the next few days as the patient increases mobility and the CO2 is slowly reabsorbed. Postoperative follow-up with the surgeon typically occurs 2 to 4 weeks after the procedure.\nBefore being discharged home, the patient should be advised about the potential for fatty food intolerance, which can cause abdominal bloating or diarrhea. This intolerance is usually temporary but may persist for a prolonged period due to the decreased speed of fat emulsification resulting from the loss of stored bile in the gallbladder. Most patients will experience an increase in bile production by the liver and will see an improvement in symptoms over time."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nEffective management of acute acalculous cholecystitis requires a coordinated, interprofessional approach due to the high acuity and complexity of the condition. Physicians, including intensivists and surgeons, must rapidly assess and stabilize critically ill patients, initiate timely diagnostic imaging, and determine the need for surgical intervention or percutaneous drainage. Advanced practitioners support this by performing thorough assessments, monitoring clinical progress, and facilitating communication among team members. Nurses play a critical role at the bedside, maintaining vigilant observation for subtle signs of deterioration, managing fluid balance, monitoring respiratory status, and ensuring adherence to preventive measures such as deep vein thrombosis and ulcer prophylaxis. Close collaboration with radiologists and gastroenterologists ensures timely procedural interventions, such as percutaneous cholecystostomy or ERCP-guided gallbladder decompression, when surgery is not immediately feasible.\nPharmacists contribute by tailoring antimicrobial therapy to cover likely pathogens, adjusting dosages for organ dysfunction, and preventing medication-related complications. Dietitians assess nutritional needs, particularly for NPO patients who may require IV nutrition. Physical therapists provide bedside rehabilitation to prevent deconditioning and promote recovery in frail patients. Effective communication among all team members ensures consistent updates, accurate documentation, and shared decision-making centered around patient goals and safety. The complex nature of acalculous cholecystitis, combined with its high morbidity and mortality rate, underscores the need for seamless interprofessional collaboration, clear role delineation, and a unified focus on improving patient-centered outcomes and maximizing functional recovery despite the guarded prognosis."

    "text": "Etiology\nThe etiology of acute cholecystitis is, by definition, cystic duct blockage, which causes inflammation. Normally, bile is made in the liver and travels down the bile duct, and is stored in the gallbladder. After eating certain foods, especially spicy or greasy foods, the gallbladder is stimulated to empty the bile of the gallbladder, through the cystic duct, down the bile duct into the duodenum. This process aids in food digestion.\nThe gallbladder not only stores the bile, but it also can concentrate it. Concentrated bile is susceptible to precipitation forming stones when homeostasis is disrupted, which can occur due to bile stasis, supersaturation from the liver of cholesterol and lipids, disruption in the concentration process, and cholesterol crystal nucleation.\nWhen cystic duct blockage is caused by a stone, it is called acute calculous cholecystitis. It is important to know, one can have pain due to temporary obstruction by gallstones, and that is called biliary colic. The diagnosis of biliary colic is upgraded to acute calculous cholecystitis if the pain does not resolve in six hours. If no stone is identified, it is called acute acalculous cholecystitis.\nRegardless of the cause of the blockage, the gallbladder wall edema will eventually cause wall ischemia and become gangrenous. The gangrenous gallbladder can become infected by gas-forming organisms, causing acute emphysematous cholecystitis; all of these conditions can quickly become life-threatening, and rupture has a high rate of mortality.\nAbout 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones.  However that does not mean incidental findings of gallstone should be treated, as it is estimated that only 20% of patients with asymptomatic stones will develop symptoms within 20 years, and because approximately 1% of patients with asymptomatic stones develop complications of their stones before the onset of symptoms, prophylactic cholecystectomy is not warranted in asymptomatic patients."

    "text": "Evaluation\nA physical exam with a comprehensive history is paramount in making the diagnosis of cholecystitis. A complete blood count (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel are also important. In cases of chronic cholecystitis, these results may be normal. In acute cholecystitis or severe disease, white blood cell count (WBC) may be elevated. Liver enzymes may also be elevated. If there is a high bilirubin level above 2, then consider a possible common bile duct stone. Note that even in the presence of severe gallbladder disease, lab values may be normal. Amylase and lipase must also be checked to rule out pancreatitis. Often a CT scan is ordered in the emergency department as the first imaging test in the workup. Findings of cholecystitis and gallstones can often be seen in this imaging. A gallbladder ultrasound is the best test to evaluate gallbladder disease initially. A thickened gallbladder wall and gallstones are common findings with this condition. In cases of acute cholecystitis, a hepatobiliary (HIDA) scan is recommended. This scan will diagnose gallbladder function or cystic duct obstruction. The addition of cholecystokinin (CCK) in cases of no gallstones may also diagnose acalculous cholecystitis. This is indicated by an ejection fracture of less than 35%."

Pearls and Other Issues\nCholecystitis can occur in the very young and very old, but the highest incidence is in the fourth decade. The classic mantra of \"fat, forty, fertile, and flatulent\" often applies. Food intolerances are usually the initiating factor of nausea, vomiting, and bloating, but as this condition progresses, there may be persistent symptoms even when the patient has not eaten. The preferred recommended treatment is the removal of the gallbladder. In the past, this was done through an open laparotomy incision. Now laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice. This procedure has low mortality and morbidity, a quick recovery time (usually one week), and good results. At times, patients present to the primary care practitioner with mild symptoms of cholecystitis and gallstones. This can present a challenge to the physician to know what is the appropriate treatment. Often conservative medical management is recommended. This would include low-fat diet modification and possible weight loss. Unfortunately, for surgeons, these patients often present to the emergency department with symptoms of acute cholecystitis and undergo urgent surgery. This situation also increases operative morbidity rates. Therefore, general surgeons usually recommend patients undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy earlier than later in the course of the disease. Other considerations would be the passing of gallstones into the bile duct causing biliary obstruction and possible pancreatitis."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nManaging acute cholecystitis is now routine, and most patients have an excellent prognosis. However, problems arise in patients with acalculous cholecystitis and when there are bile duct stones. Patients with acalculous cholecystitis are often managed in the intensive care unit and may undergo an initial aspiration procedure until they are fit to undergo formal surgery. Since many of these patients have high comorbidity, monitoring them is critical. Educating the patient and family is vital since the condition does carry a high mortality. The other group of patients who may have a prolonged stay are those with a bile duct stone. These patients require an ERCP prior to cholecystectomy. Again ERCP is not a benign procedure, and patients need to be educated about the procedure and potential complications. Patients with numerous comorbid factors need to be evaluated by the cardiologist prior to general anesthesia. The preoperative nurse should ensure that the patient has the requisite clearance, ECG, chest x-ray, and blood work before the surgery. If there are any deficiencies or concerns, the surgeon should be contacted prior to the procedure. (Level V) After the procedure, the nurse will monitor vital signs and assist in managing the patient's pain. If there is any significant change in vital signs or the pain cannot be controlled with the medications provided, the surgeon should be consulted. Pre-operatively, the pharmacist should access the patient's medications and make sure that there is no concern for withdrawal or potential interaction with the anesthetics. The clinical team should be apprised if there are any concerns. **Outcomes**\nFor patients with uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, the prognosis is excellent."
