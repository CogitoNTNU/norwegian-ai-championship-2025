    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nElectrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is a pediatric epileptic encephalopathy characterized by cognitive regression and significant activation of epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in an electroencephalography pattern marked by nearly continuous spike-wave discharges. The condition typically affects children between the ages of 2 and 12, with a peak incidence between 3 and 5 years. ESES is associated with various etiologies, which may or may not involve structural brain abnormalities. Clinically, affected children often present with infrequent seizures, either focal or generalized, and experience stagnation or regression in their developmental progress. The current treatment approach includes the use of traditional antiepileptic drugs, such as benzodiazepines and corticosteroids, as well as other therapies like epilepsy surgery, intravenous immunoglobulin, and the ketogenic diet.\nParticipants in this activity gain a comprehensive understanding of the evaluation and management of ESES. They learn about the critical importance of early diagnosis and intervention to prevent long-term cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for affected children. The activity emphasizes the value of an interprofessional team approach in managing ESES, where collaboration among neurologists, pediatricians, neuropsychologists, and other healthcare professionals enhances patient outcomes. By integrating knowledge from various specialties, the healthcare team can develop individualized treatment plans that address both the seizure control and cognitive development of the patient, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify the early signs and symptoms of electrical status epilepticus in sleep in patients to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n- Assess the effectiveness of treatment plans for patients with electrical status epilepticus in sleep, and adjust them as necessary to optimize patient outcomes.\n- Implement evidence-based treatment strategies, including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, for managing electrical status epilepticus in sleep.\n- Collaborate with an interprofessional team to create and execute individualized treatment plans for children with electrical status epilepticus in sleep."

Etiology\nDifferent etiologies, both with or without structural abnormalities of the brain, have been associated with ESES. An early developmental lesion, such as a perinatal infarct involving the thalamus, has been particularly correlated with the development of ESES. In a case-control study, results showed that 14% of the patients with epilepsy and sleep-activated EEG had early developmental lesions involving thalami, such as stroke, periventricular leukomalacia, and cortical malformation. However, only 2% of the patients in the control group had a thalamic lesion (patients with epilepsy but not with sleep-activated EEG).\nRecently, several genetic etiologies, including monogenic mutations or copy number variants, have been correlated with the development of ESES. Among monogenic mutations, including those in _SCN2A, SLC9A6, DRPLA/ ATN1, n_ euroserpin _/SRPX2, OPA3, KCNQ2, KCNA2, GRIN2A, CNKSR2, SLC6A1,_ and _KCNB1_ , _GRIN2A_ mutations, with possible dysfunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated signaling, have most frequently linked with ESES. Recurrent copy number variants were reported in association with ESES, such as Xp22.12 deletion, 16p13 deletion, 15q11.2-13.1 duplication, 3q29 duplication, 11p13 duplication, 10q21.3 deletion, 3q25 deletion, and 8p23.3 deletion.\nThe exact reason for the sleep activation of the EEG abnormality is unknown. Some researchers correlated abnormal EEG with the abnormal hyperactivation of the thalamic oscillatory circuit: an interplay between inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABA) reticular thalamic neurons and excitatory glutaminergic dorsal thalamic neurons. Researchers also hypothesized that the change in the thalamic oscillatory circuit might be due to a substitution from GABAa- to GABAb-mediated postsynaptic inhibition. Sleep potentiation of epileptiform discharges may disrupt cortical information processing and trigger learning and memory impairments."

Sleep potentiation of epileptiform discharges may disrupt cortical information processing and trigger learning and memory impairments. Treatment / Management\nDue to a lack of randomized controlled studies, current treatment options are primarily based on retrospective studies and expert opinions. The treatment goal\u2014suppression of the EEG abnormalities, improvement of the seizure control, amelioration of the behavioral abnormalities, and reversal of cognitive regression\u2014must be established at the time of the diagnosis. The existing treatment paradigm has its basis in uncontrolled studies and case series and primarily focuses on the use of traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including benzodiazepines and corticosteroids, epilepsy surgery, and other nonpharmacologic therapies such as the administration of IVIG or a ketogenic diet. The most common AEDs used for ESES include valproate, ethosuximide, and levetiracetam. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, researchers noted that levetiracetam decreased the spike-wave index to 37 (mean) from a baseline of 56 (mean) at the end of the treatment period (_P_ < 0.0002). Rarely, ethosuximide and sulthiame have been reported to improve ESES as a monotherapy, but as adjunctive and combination therapy, both have had extensive use. Although valproate has not been associated with worsening seizures in ESES, the definitive efficacy of this agent is unknown and should not be used as first-line therapy. Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam and clobazam, have been extensively used when treating ESES. A group of researchers treated 29 children with ESES with oral high-dose diazepam (1 mg/kg; maximum of 40 mg) and noted a reduction of the spike-wave index from 76.7% to 40.8% within 24 hours. These patients received 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam for 3 weeks after the initial high dose before gradual tapering. Reversible side effects\u2014sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, hypotonia, paradoxical aggravation\u2014occurred in approximately one-quarter of patients."

Reversible side effects\u2014sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, hypotonia, paradoxical aggravation\u2014occurred in approximately one-quarter of patients. Larrieu et al first described the utility of clobazam in 1986. Only rare reports of precipitation of absence status in ESES have appeared associated with clobazam. Caraballo et al demonstrated that clobazam was effective in 5 of 117 patients and in combination with other agents in 86 of 117 patients. A few specific antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can worsen seizure control in ESES and require withdrawal in the presence of worsening drop or absence seizures. Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone) have been utilized in different therapeutic regimens, both as long-term continuous therapy lasting for months or intermittent monthly high-dose treatment. Buzatu et al retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of a 21-month regimen of hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg/day during the first month, 4 mg/kg/day during the second month, 3 mg/kg/day during the third month, 2 mg/kg/day for next 9 months, and slow taper during remaining of the treatment period) in 44 patients with a positive response in 34 patients during the first 3 months of the treatment, and with normalization of EEG in 21 patients. However, among 34 responders, 14 patients had a subsequent relapse. Higher intelligence and developmental quotients and shorter disease duration before initiating treatment were associated with a positive outcome. Due to side effects, 7 patients discontinued treatment early. Chen et al reviewed the efficacy of a different regimen of corticosteroids that used a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone with oral prednisone for 6 months. This study has results reporting a high response rate but a high relapse rate at 1-year follow-up. Due to fear of side effects from long-duration corticosteroid therapy, methylprednisolone pulse therapy (15 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days consecutively, once a month for 4 months) has also been used successfully."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines status epilepticus (SE) as continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity, or recurrent seizure activity without recovery to baseline, lasting for \u2265 5 mins. If the seizure activity continues despite treatment with adequate doses of an initial benzodiazepine and an acceptable second-line intravenous (IV) antiepileptic medication, the patient is considered to have progressed into refractory status epilepticus (RSE). Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is defined as RSE that continues or recurs despite the use of IV anesthetic agents for \u2265 24 hours, including those cases that recur upon withdrawal or cessation of anesthetic agents. RSE is seen in approximately 9% to 43% of all SE cases, with a reported in-hospital mortality of 15% to 33%. It has been observed that approximately 4% to 12% of patients with SE eventually progress to SRSE, with in-hospital mortality reported to be as high as 40% to 54%.\nThe term new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) was first used by Wilder-Smith et al. in 2005 to describe cases of SRSE with no associated past medical history of epilepsy and with no identifiable cause despite initial evaluation. In 2018 an international group of experts proposed a consensus definition of NORSE and related conditions to allow a more standardized terminology to improve patient management and clinical research. NORSE is defined as a \u201cclinical presentation characterized by new onset of refractory status epilepticus, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurological disorder (acute strokes, brain masses, drug overdoses, etc.), and without a clear acute or active structural, toxic or metabolic cause.\u201d A closely related condition, febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), has been defined as a subset of NORSE, associated with a prior febrile infection, with fever starting between 2 weeks to 24 hours before the onset of RSE. In contrast, patients with NORSE may or may not be associated with fever before the start of RSE."

Etiology\nIn a large retrospective review, consisting of 130 NORSE cases, an etiology was not identified in 52% of cases despite an extensive evaluation. These cases were termed as \u201ccryptogenic NORSE\u201d or \u201cNORSE of unknown etiology.\u201d The most common etiologies included autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis followed by infections.\n- **Non-paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis** - The most frequently detected antibodies include anti-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, anti-VGKC (voltage-gated potassium complex), anti-LGI1, and less commonly anti-Caspr2. Other autoimmune antibodies that have been found in patients with NORSE include - Anti-GABA, Anti-glycine, Anti-GAD65, Anti-striational, and steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT).\n- **Paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis** - Anti NMDA receptor-associated encephalitis is the most common in this category. Young females are predominantly affected, and 50% of cases are associated with germ cell tumors like ovarian teratoma. Other antibodies that have been identified include anti-Hu (small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma), anti-CRMP5 (small cell lung cancer), anti-Ma2 (germ cell tumor of testis), anti-amphiphysin (breast cancer, small cell lung cancer), and anti-VGCC (small cell lung cancer, thymoma).\n- **Infections** - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common etiology identified in NORSE amongst infectious agents. Enterovirus, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Bartonella henselae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and arboviruses (West Nile virus) have also been detected in patients with NORSE.\n- Some of the rare genetic conditions (POLG131), including mitochondrial defects, have also been associated with NORSE."

Pathophysiology\nAn immune-mediated inflammatory process has been postulated as the underlying pathophysiology in FIRES. In a study by Sakuma et al., the authors observed a marked overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with FIRES, compared to CSF specimens from patients with other inflammatory neurological conditions. The upregulation of these inflammatory mediators could be secondary to activation of T cells, glial cells, and cells of the blood-brain barrier and perhaps have a role in epileptogenesis. However, additional mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction or synaptic plasticity may also play a key role in seizure propagation.\nRecently, a personal predisposition towards developing FIRES or NORSE has been hypothesized based on allelic variations in human leukocyte antigen subtypes and IL1 pathway. The fact that FIRES is a subtype of NORSE, a similar autoimmune inflammatory mechanism has been considered as the most likely mechanism in patients with NORSE. Further research studies are required to understand the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism in patients with NORSE and FIRES."

Further research studies are required to understand the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism in patients with NORSE and FIRES. History and Physical\nNORSE and its subtype FIRES can develop in previously healthy adults or children and share some common clinical characteristics. Approximately 60% of patients with NORSE experience a prodromal illness, typically 1 to 14 days before the onset of seizure or SE. Prodromal symptoms may include confusion, fatigue, headache, mild febrile illness, behavioral changes, mild gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, and memory complaints. Fever is absent in up to 1/3 cases of NORSE, but, by definition, it is universally present in FIRES. There is complete cessation of fever in approximately 50% of patients before the first seizure episode.\nAt the onset, seizures are usually brief and isolated with a propensity to gradually increase in number within a few hours to days and eventually evolve into SE. The number of seizures can be up \u2265 100/day in children. Focal motor seizures are the most common seizure type seen, which may spread and generalize into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Other seizure types may include myoclonic seizures affecting the oro-facial muscles or focal seizures associated with impaired awareness. Seizures can last anywhere from a few days to weeks before progressing to SE.\nOnce the seizures evolve into SE, they remain refractory to the first and second-line treatment options, requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further aggressive treatment options. Patients with unknown etiology or \u201ccryptogenic NORSE\u201d have been observed to have similar clinical features and disease course compared to patients with NORSE caused by autoimmune encephalitis but with a longer duration and severity of seizures associated with respiratory involvement requiring mechanical ventilation and worse outcomes."

Evaluation\nPatients who present with SE should undergo an initial laboratory workup, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Urine and blood toxicology screen (alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, heavy metals, synthetic cannabinoids, ecstasy, and bath salts) should be sent on admission. For patients who progress to RSE and the initial workup fails to elucidate an etiology, additional laboratory investigations should then be considered to focus on autoimmune and uncommon infectious etiologies. **Laboratory**\nA lumbar puncture should be performed if no clear etiology can be found on initial testing. Routine CSF studies, including cell count, protein, glucose, lactate, markers of inflammation (oligoclonal bands and IgG index), gram stain, bacteria culture, and cytology should be sent. Additional CSF studies should include fungal stain and cultures for M. tuberculosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV-1/2, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), HIV-1/2, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and VDRL in selected cases when the etiology remains unknown. In approximately 2/3 of NORSE cases, mild CSF pleocytosis (\u2264 10 cells/\u03bcl) with elevated protein and normal glucose can be seen, with no significant difference in CSF findings between cryptogenic cases and cases with identifiable etiology. HSV PCR has high sensitivity (98 %) and specificity (99 %) and is positive early in the course of HSV meningitis/encephalitis. However, HSV PCR can be negative when LP is performed less than 24 hours from the onset of neurological symptoms. Both CSF and serum should be tested for autoimmune anti-NMDA receptor, anti-VGKC (LGI1 and Caspr2), anti-AMPA, anti-GABA, and paraneoplastic antibodies (Anti-Hu, anti-CRMP5, anti-amphiphysin, anti-VGCC)."

An autoimmune panel (ANA, ANCA, Anti Ro, Anti La, Antithyroid antibodies, anti-Scl-70) should be sent for further testing. Viral serologies, most commonly HSV-1/2, VZV, EBV, enterovirus, and HIV-1/2, should be ordered in all patients with NORSE. For immunocompromised patients, serologies should be sent for IgG Cryptococcus species, IgM and IgG Histoplasma capsulatum, and IgG Toxoplasma gondii. Stool specimens should be investigated for adenovirus and enterovirus. A scrotal ultrasound, pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomographic (CT) scan, and whole-body PET-CT are recommended to screen for an underlying malignancy in patients with suspicion for a paraneoplastic process. **Neuroimaging**\nAll patients with NORSE and FIRES should have a brain MRI with contrast, including venography and angiography, to evaluate structural or focal abnormalities. In approximately 60% of NORSE cases, symmetrical or asymmetrical abnormalities can be seen on the brain MRI. The most common findings observed include hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR sequences within the limbic and neocortical structures, often bilaterally. Other brain regions like the claustrum, basal ganglia/thalami, and peri-insular cortex can show abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. **Electroencephalography (EEG)**\nAll patients should have continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) to assess seizure type and frequency, rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and monitor therapy response. The neurocritical care society guidelines recommend initiating cEEG in all patients within 1 hour of onset of SE. EEG may demonstrate periodic or epileptiform discharges, which are most commonly lateralized or focal, generalized periodic discharges, and multifocal discharges. The most common seizure noted in one series was focal onset followed by bilateral independent, generalized, and multifocal seizures. Seizures are brief and infrequent at the onset, associated with focal fast beta activity with a gradual evolution to SE characterized by rhythmic spike and wave complexes or beta-delta activity. Some EEG patterns may provide clues to a specific diagnosis in a few cases."

Some EEG patterns may provide clues to a specific diagnosis in a few cases. Treatment / Management\nStatus epilepticus is a neurological emergency that requires the immediate cessation of seizure activity to prevent permanent neurological injury. Initial management should be following the currently available guidelines. - Patients should be stabilized first with regards to their cardiocirculatory function. - Airway patency and safety should be ensured. Supplemental O2 through a nasal cannula or other non-invasive methods should be considered to ensure oxygenation before advancing to intubation and mechanical ventilation. - Rapid sequence intubation should be performed in patients with impaired oxygenation or ventilation despite conservative measures. - Intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines are the agents of choice for aborting seizures emergently. The use of benzodiazepines in the prehospital setting has been shown to terminate seizures in 43% to 59% cases with SE, en-route to the hospital, with less need for respiratory support on arrival to the emergency department and need for ICU subsequently. Intramuscular (IM) midazolam has been observed to be superior and more efficacious than IV lorazepam in patients without IV access. However, IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, IV diazepam, and IV phenobarbital have been recommended as initial drugs of choice for aborting seizures lasting at least 5 minutes, with similar efficacy. - IV acyclovir should be started early during the course of illness in patients with suspicion for HSV encephalitis (acute febrile encephalopathy, new-onset seizures, asymmetric medial temporal lobe involvement, and lymphocytic pleocytosis with RBCs on CSF analysis), pending HSV-PCR results in CSF. It has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity when started early in the course of illness. - In patients with benzodiazepine refractory SE, a second-line antiepileptic agent should be attempted immediately at appropriate doses."

The effectiveness of each subsequent antiepileptic added in aborting status epilepticus decreases after initiating the first antiepileptic agent\n- If seizures continue despite treatment with a second-line agent, another anti-epileptic agent should be used before progressing to IV anesthetic agents. IV phenytoin/fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, valproate, levetiracetam, and lacosamide; have been noted to be effective in the treatment of established SE with no preference over each other. Hence one of these agents, either as single or in combination, can be used for treatment. By definition, patients who fail to respond to first and second-line therapies progress to refractory SE and require treatment with continuous IV anesthetic agents to achieve seizure control. - Current guidelines recommend using continuous IV infusion of anesthetic agents for seizure suppression or burst suppression coma for 24-48 hours before attempting to wean. - Midazolam: Load with 0.2 mg/kg IV followed by continuous infusion at 0.05 to 2 mg/kg/hr. - Propofol: 2 mg/kg IV bolus followed by maintenance infusion at 20 to 250 mcg/kg/min. - Pentobarbital: 5 mg/kg IV bolus, continuous infusion at 1 to 10 mg/kg/hr. - Ketamine: Load with 0.5-4 mg/kg followed by maintenance infusion at 0.3 to 5 mg/kg/hr. - IV midazolam and propofol are preferred over longer-acting agents like pentobarbital as long-acting agents are associated with a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular complications. However, higher doses and prolonged treatment of propofol have been associated with propofol infusion syndrome leading to higher mortality and complications than midazolam and ketamine. Patients with NORSE (or FIRES) often have a poor response to antiepileptic medications, and continuous IV anesthetic agents should be started without further delay, given the disease process's refractory nature."

Multiple anesthetic agents are required in approximately 1/3 of patients with NORSE to achieve seizure suppression, and often for prolonged periods. Since no specific therapy exists for patients with NORSE/FIRES, experts recommend using immunotherapies as soon as possible since nearly half of the cases are associated with an autoimmune/paraneoplastic etiology. First-line immunotherapy agents include steroids, IV immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis. Second-line options include tacrolimus, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and anakinra. Immunotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes and control seizures more effectively in adults as compared to children. There are currently no randomized controlled trials or prospective studies to guide immunotherapy in such patients, and recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion and experience from case series. - Once the initial workup fails to elucidate a cause for RSE, and there is a high suspicion for NORSE, IV methylprednisolone should be started ideally within the first week at a dose of 1 gm/day for 3 to 5 days. - Alternatively, other first-line treatment options (IV immunoglobulin 0.4 gm/day for 3 to 5 days or plasmapheresis for 3 to 5 sessions on alternate days) can be used depending on patient characteristics and clinical context. - If there is no response to first-line therapies, i.e., failure to wean anesthetic agents due to high risk of seizure recurrence or prolonged RSE, the following second-line immunotherapies can then be considered: IV rituximab 375 mg/m^2 weekly for four doses, or IV cyclophosphamide 500-1000 mg/m^2 monthly for 3 to 6 months. - Anakinra, a recombinant version of the human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been observed to reduce the seizure frequency and achieve remission in two case reports. - Other therapeutic options (hypothermia, cannabidiol, ketogenic diet), although less studied, have also been attempted in NORSE patients with mixed results and need to be validated."

Differential Diagnosis\nIn most of the cases of NORSE, an etiology remains unknown despite an extensive workup. However, autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis remains the most common identifiable etiology in NORSE. Therefore, a detailed history and clinical examination should be sought as certain clinical features can point towards a specific underlying etiology leading to early immunotherapy during the acute phase, ultimately influencing outcomes and disability. - Anti-NMDA encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis and should be ruled out early. It usually starts as a febrile illness in young adults, common in females. This is soon followed by psychiatric disturbances like hallucinations (behavioral changes in children), sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, memory complaints, epileptic seizures, oro-lingual dyskinesias, and autonomic failure. As compared to anti-NMDA encephalitis, patients with cryptogenic NORSE are more frequently associated with early onset of SE, prolonged disease course, absence of behavioral symptoms, ventilator dependence, and worse outcomes. - Encephalitis with anti-VGKC complex antibodies (LGI1 or, more rarely, Caspr2) can present with limbic encephalitis (cognitive impairment, confusion, behavioral disturbances, sleep disturbances, and seizures) and abnormalities in serum sodium levels associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Facio-brachial dystonic seizures can occur in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis and is a pathognomonic feature of the disease. - Amongst infectious causes, patients should be screened for uncommon infections as early as possible. HSV-1 infection can present with an acute illness consisting of fever, alteration in mentation, behavioral changes, multiple seizures (though uncommon to progress to RSE), focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, ataxia, aphasia), without or without dermatomal rashes."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nNORSE is relatively an uncommon clinical entity with no clear etiology in the majority of the cases. It is associated with significant mortality and long-term neurological sequelae, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for management. Although no prospective long-term studies are comparing the efficacy of different treatment options in NORSE, physicians should recognize such patients and initiate treatment early during the disease course to improve patient outcomes.\nPhysicians and other health care team members, including nurses and pharmacists, should focus on the early institution of treatment, including the use of aggressive immunotherapies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Clear communication with an emphasis on discussing the uncertain nature of the diagnosis, treatment options available, and possible outcomes; should be maintained with the patient\u2019s family throughout the course of the disease. Palliative care services can be consulted early during the hospital course to offer support to the family members and facilitate care discussion goals should the need arise. They can play an essential role in building a strong relationship between the patient\u2019s family and the health care teams. Physicians should encourage families to participate in the national registry for NORSE patients (www.norseinstitute.org/norse-registry-2) to promote clinical research with an aim to understand possible causes of NORSE, identify best treatment options and hence improve patient outcomes.\nOverall, an interprofessional healthcare team approach to managing NORSE will yield the best patient outcomes. This team is comprised of clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, working collaboratively with open communication lines to achieve the best possible care standard."

An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance and a polygenic or multifactorial mode of inheritance may be present in addition to specific genes that increase the risk of febrile seizures and are found on the following loci of chromosomes: 1q31, 2q23*34, 3p24.2*23, 3q26.2*26.33, 5q14*15, 5q34, 6q22*24, 8q13*21, 18p11*2, 19p13*3, 19q, and 21q22. Another factor determining the risk of febrile seizures may be the highest temperature reached during a fever rather than the speed at which the temperature rises. A contributing factor that can also affect fever's impact is the seizure threshold, which varies among individuals and changes with age and development. Infants have a higher risk of febrile seizures, but premature infants are at an even higher risk, especially those receiving postnatal corticosteroids."

Infants have a higher risk of febrile seizures, but premature infants are at an even higher risk, especially those receiving postnatal corticosteroids. Furthermore, infants generally have a lower seizure threshold, which may be modified by certain medications and water and electrolyte imbalances (eg, hyponatremia). Iron, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, selenium, calcium, and magnesium deficiencies increase the risk of febrile seizures. No specific fever etiology is more likely to cause febrile seizures; however, 80% of viral infections rather than bacterial infections are commonly associated with febrile seizures. _Roseolovirus_ is the most common virus associated with febrile seizures in the US and European countries and is observed in up to one-third of patients younger than 2 years. Other studies have found that febrile seizures secondary to _Roseolovirus_ are associated with a higher incidence of complex features, recurrence, and febrile status epilepticus. In Asian countries, however, influenza A has been frequently associated with febrile seizures. Other commonly associated viral infections include human _herpesvirus 7 (_ HHV-7), human coronavirus HKU1, adenovirus, RSV, cytomegalovirus, shigella, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Vaccines have also been shown to temporarily increase the risk of febrile seizures a few days postinoculation. These include the DTaP-IPV-Hib, MMRV, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, and some formulations of inactivated influenza vaccines. The risk, although low, is also slightly higher in those getting more than one vaccination at a time.

History and Physical\n**Clinical History**\nA comprehensive medical history and detailed description of the seizure event are essential for the evaluation of a possible febrile seizure. Because febrile seizures most commonly occur in children, a parent or caregiver is critical to help provide the patient's history, including vaccination history, immunization status, family history of seizure activity, any recent illness, development, exposure to toxins, and personal medical history. Historical information regarding the interval between fever onset and seizure activity, seizure appearance, length, and postictal symptoms should also be obtained, as this can help differentiate simple febrile seizures from complex types. Simple febrile seizures usually have a single episode of generalized tonic-clonic movements, often involving facial and respiratory muscles, lasting less than 15 minutes with a short period of postictal drowsiness. Conversely, complex febrile seizures are characterized by focal seizures, usually limited to one side of the body, lasting 15 minutes or more, that can recur within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizures are frequently followed by postictal weakness or paralysis on one side of the body (ie, Todd paralysis). Other associated symptoms for both febrile seizure types include loss of consciousness, foaming at the mouth, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. Additionally, clinicians should inquire about possible central nervous system (CNS) infection and underlying structural abnormalities to determine whether an event of concern constitutes a febrile seizure or a more severe illness presenting with a seizure. **Clinical Examination**\nFollowing seizure activity, patients must undergo a general physical and a neurologic exam to ensure that the patient has had a neurologic return to their baseline state."

Prognosis\nFebrile seizures are typically harmless and do not cause long-term neurological or cognitive problems. The majority of children who experience febrile seizures have normal developmental outcomes. Studies suggest that around 30% of children with a history of febrile seizures are at an increased risk of having recurrent episodes. Children younger than 12 months at the time of their first febrile seizure have a 50% chance of experiencing a second seizure within the first year. However, this risk decreased to 30% in the following year. Factors such as young age during the initial seizure, a family history of febrile seizures, low fever intensity during the seizure, and a short interval between fever onset and the seizure may indicate a higher likelihood of recurrent febrile seizures. On the other hand, features associated with complex febrile seizures do not necessarily increase the risk of recurrence.\nApproximately 1% to 2% of children with simple febrile seizures, which is only slightly higher than the general population of .5% to .9%, may develop epilepsy later on. However, children with a history of complex febrile seizure, febrile seizure at an earlier age, prolonged febrile seizure, abnormal neurodevelopment, abnormal EEG, and a family history of epilepsy have an estimated 2% to 10% risk of developing epilepsy, depending now how many risk factors are present. Notably, a single febrile seizure episode does not appear to be linked to learning disabilities, lower intelligence, behavioral problems, or executive functioning. However, in those with recurrent febrile seizures, an increased risk of delayed vocabulary development may be present."

Introduction\nAbsence seizures are brief seizures characterized by a behavioral arrest correlating with generalized 3-Hz spike and wave discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG). Absence seizures occur in multiple genetic generalized epilepsies, including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Genetic generalized epilepsies comprise about one-fourth of all epilepsies. Atypical absence seizures have been reported in up to 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\nHistorically, absence epilepsy was known as \"pyknolepsy.\" This originates from the Greek term _pyknos_ , meaning \"very frequent\" or \"grouped.\" The term \"petit mal\" seizure was previously used to describe an absence seizure, but the term is no longer encouraged. The International League Against Epilepsy Classification of 2017 defines absence seizures as \"generalized nonmotor seizures.\" However, this term is not entirely precise because, as discussed below, motor manifestations of absence epilepsy are frequently seen.\nAbsence seizures have often been considered \"benign\" due to their nonconvulsive nature; however, up to 60% of children with absence seizures have severe neuropsychic manifestations, including disturbances in attention, cognition, memory, and mood. Absence epilepsy affects a child's psychosocial and academic function and requires treatment."

Absence epilepsy affects a child's psychosocial and academic function and requires treatment. Etiology\nA genetic component exists for all generalized epilepsies and, specifically, for absence epilepsy. The inheritance pattern is not strictly autosomal recessive or dominant and is considered to be multifactorial and polygenic. In 1951, Lennox reported that 66% of monozygotic twins showed concordance for the EEG pattern of 3-Hertz spike and wave discharges. These can be voltage-gated (_CACNA1H, CACNG3, CLCN2)_ or ligand-gated (_CHRNA4_ , _GABRA1, GABRB3, GABRG2, GRM4_). CAE is linked to many genetic variations, including at the following locations:\n- Calcium-channel genes: _CACNA1H_ and _CACNG3_ (especially in Han Chinese)\n- GABA-A and GABA-B receptors: GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter highly involved in epileptogenesis. _GABRA1, GABRB3,_ and _GABRG2_ are variants relating to CAE.\n- Glutamate receptor: Mutations in _GRM4_ alter glutamate and GABA regulation.\n- \u03bc-Opioid Receptor: _OPRM1_ is an opioid receptor where mutations can cause thalamic hyperexcitability.\n- Solute transfer receptor: _SLC6A3/DAT1_ are 2 genes in this category encoding a dopamine transporter.\nAlso, some copy number variants (CNVs), for example, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, and 16p13.11 microdeletion, have been described in patients with CAE. However, the mode of inheritance and the majority of genes implicated in CAE are still unknown."

However, the mode of inheritance and the majority of genes implicated in CAE are still unknown. Pathophysiology\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of the development of absence seizures is not yet fully understood. However, the cortico-thalamic-cortical circuit is believed to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of absence seizures. Some of the neurons involved in the cortico-thalamic-cortical system include the following:\n- Cortical glutamatergic neurons originating on cortical layer VI and projecting to the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus\n- Thalamic relay neurons with excitatory projections to cortical pyramidal neurons\n- Neurons from the thalamic nucleus reticularis containing inhibitory GABA-ergic projections that connect with other neurons from the same nucleus and with thalamic relay neurons. These neurons do not connect directly with the cortex. Neurons from the thalamic nucleus reticularis can fire in an oscillatory pattern (eg, rhythmic bursts involved in generating sleep spindles) or continuously in single spikes (tonic firing during wakefulness). Shifts between these 2 firing patterns in the thalamic nucleus reticularis are modulated by spikes in thalamocortical networks and neurons from the thalamic nucleus reticularis. These are mediated through low-threshold transient calcium channels known as T-type channels. After depolarization, T-type channels briefly allow calcium inflow before becoming inactivated. Reactivation requires a relatively long hyperpolarization facilitated by GABA-B receptors. Therefore, abnormal oscillatory rhythms can originate from T-type channel abnormality from increased GABA-B activity. As explained by the genetics of absence epilepsy, genes coding for T-type calcium channels and GABA receptors have been associated with the etiopathogenesis of this type of epilepsy. Medications that suppress T-type calcium channels, such as ethosuximide and valproate, are effective anti-absence drugs. Conversely, medications that increase GABA-B activity (eg, vigabatrin) exacerbate the frequency of absence seizures."

Conversely, medications that increase GABA-B activity (eg, vigabatrin) exacerbate the frequency of absence seizures. History and Physical\nThe age of onset of CAE is usually between 4 and 10 years, with a peak between the ages of 5 and 7. The onset of absence epilepsy before age 4 should raise concern for an underlying glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency. About 10% to 15% of patients with CAE have a history of febrile seizures. Regarding the clinical presentation, family members and teachers usually describe brief spells in which the child has a loss of awareness, is unresponsive, and has a behavioral arrest. Bystanders often describe the patient during these spells as having \u201ca blank stare.\u201d Episodes frequently occur, often 10 to 30 times throughout the day. Most children stop their activity completely, but some can continue it more slowly or unusually. Some children have 3-Hz regular eyelid fluttering. Clinical presentation can also vary in the same individual. Oral automatisms can also occur, especially with prolonged seizures or during hyperventilation. Children frequently have mild clonic or tonic movements in the first few seconds of the spell. Pallor is commonly reported. Urinary incontinence is rare. Spells usually last between 4 and 30 seconds. Hyperventilation, a state of arousal, sleep deprivation, and medication use can affect the duration of the seizure. These seizures are not preceded by an aura and do not have a postictal state. On physical examination, hyperventilation can trigger absence seizures. To test this, the examiner asks the child to blow repetitively for at least 2 minutes. Using a pinwheel or paper can be helpful because this encourages the child to cooperate more during testing. If hyperventilation is done successfully, the patient may develop seizures that can be seen clinically or on EEG."

Using a pinwheel or paper can be helpful because this encourages the child to cooperate more during testing. If hyperventilation is done successfully, the patient may develop seizures that can be seen clinically or on EEG. Evaluation\nEEG is the main diagnostic tool for the evaluation of absence epilepsy. In the case of childhood absence seizures, EEG shows bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3-Hz spike and wave discharges that start and end abruptly (see **Image.** EEG Showing the Characteristic 3-Hz Spike and Wave Discharges Seen in Absence Epilepsy). These discharges sometimes have maximum frontal amplitude or begin with unilateral focal spikes. In 50% of seizures in CAE, the initial discharge seen has a typical spike and wave morphology. The remaining 50% can show a single spike, polyspikes, or an atypical, irregular, generalized spike and wave on a normal background.\nAtypical absence seizures show a more insidious onset and offset, slower spike and wave paroxysms (slower than 3 Hz), and an abnormal interictal background. In JAE, EEG demonstrates paroxysms of generalized 3- to 4-Hertz spike-and-wave or polyspike and wave discharges.\nNeuropsychological testing has shown that patients with CAE have a higher rate of cognitive deficits, especially involving attention, executive function, and verbal and visuospatial memory. Difficulty with language and reading is also commonly reported. Depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder also have been reported more frequently in patients with CAE.\nIn the case of absence status, EEG shows continuous or nearly continuous generalized spike and wave or polyspike and wave discharges at 2 to 4 Hz. In patients with a new diagnosis of absence seizures, brain imaging is indicated to assess for structural abnormalities."

In patients with a new diagnosis of absence seizures, brain imaging is indicated to assess for structural abnormalities. Treatment / Management\nThe first-line treatment for absence epilepsy is ethosuximide. A randomized controlled trial in 2010 that included 446 children with CAE showed that ethosuximide and valproic acid were superior to lamotrigine. However, this study had a low seizure-free rate, with 53% of patients in the ethosuximide group, 58% in the valproic acid group, and 29% in patients taking lamotrigine. The group that received valproic acid had significantly lower scores on attentional measures compared to the ethosuximide and lamotrigine groups. For this reason, ethosuximide is the preferred agent for treating absence epilepsy. A study showed that only one-quarter of children with absence epilepsy became seizure-free with levetiracetam. If effective, levetiracetam can control absence epilepsy at a relatively low dose (usually \\<40 mg/kg/d). Increasing doses are not effective if levetiracetam is not initially effective.\nThe most frequent adverse effects of ethosuximide are abdominal pain and nausea. For this reason, ethosuximide should be taken with meals. Other medications that can be used to manage CAE include valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Second-line medications that can be used as adjunct therapy include valproic acid, zonisamide, and levetiracetam. It is important to note that some sodium channel blockers like phenytoin, carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and vigabatrin can worsen absence seizures.\nWomen of childbearing age not using contraception should not be treated with valproic acid; the preferred agent is ethosuximide.\nSome experts suggest that a ketogenic or a medium-chain triglyceride diet may be beneficial, but strong evidence to support their use is lacking."

Some experts suggest that a ketogenic or a medium-chain triglyceride diet may be beneficial, but strong evidence to support their use is lacking. Differential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for staring spells includes absence epilepsy, focal seizures with alteration of awareness, and nonepileptic paroxysmal events. Focal epilepsy with alteration of awareness (previously called complex partial epilepsy) can also present with behavioral arrest and automatisms. However, these seizures are usually less frequent than absence seizures. Patients can have generalized seizures with focal epilepsy. The semiology of automatisms can vary depending on the area of the cerebral cortex where the seizures originate. A study that evaluated nonepileptic staring spells using video-EEG monitoring found that these episodes were often characterized by arrest of all activity, vague facial expressions, and vision fixed on 1 point without blinking. When the duration of the events was quantified, staring episodes lasted between 3 and 74 seconds. In most children, it was difficult to determine the onset and end of the event. Most parents could not regain the child\u2019s attention by waving their hands in front of the child. Other more energetic measures like hand clapping or other loud sounds successfully stopped the events in all children. A significant percentage of children (41%) were inactive at the onset of the stare, and 18% were watching television when the event began. A retrospective chart review performed in a tertiary care epilepsy center showed that among 276 patients in the epilepsy monitoring unit, only 11% were deemed to have seizures. Therefore, most staring spells are nonepileptic in nature. Clinicians should be careful when patients present with staring spells and not tell parents or other providers that these episodes are \u201cabsence seizures\u201d before EEG evaluation is completed."

Clinicians should be careful when patients present with staring spells and not tell parents or other providers that these episodes are \u201cabsence seizures\u201d before EEG evaluation is completed. Deterrence and Patient Education\nMost staring spells are nonepileptic in nature. When patients present with staring spells, clinicians should explain to caregivers that the differential diagnosis includes seizures, but they should avoid giving a specific diagnosis of \u201cabsence seizures\u201d before an EEG evaluation is completed. Requesting caregivers to take videos of staring spells can be very useful, as this can help characterize them. Event calendars/logs can assist in understanding the frequency, pattern, and possible triggers.\nCaregivers of children with CAE should know that generalized tonic-clonic seizures are rare. For this reason, rescue medications such as rectal diazepam and intranasal midazolam are not routinely prescribed. Nevertheless, caregivers should be taught what to do if the child has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\nCaregivers often assume that absence seizures are harmless since they are very brief. Occasionally, they question the need to treat them with medications, arguing that the risks could outweigh the benefits. In these situations, it is recommended to explain that the child is experiencing frequent episodes of altered consciousness that can increase the risk of accidents. Seizures can also interfere with learning and negatively impact school performance. Activities like swimming, diving, or rock climbing should only be permitted under supervision. Driving is not permitted if seizures are uncontrolled and can vary by location."

Pearls and Other Issues\nClinical pearls for absence seizures offer valuable insights for clinicians navigating the complexities of this neurological condition.\n- Absence epilepsy is classified as a typical or atypical absence, depending on seizure characteristics and EEG patterns.\n- Absence seizures are characterized by behavioral arrest and EEG showing 3-Hz spike and wave discharges. Episodes usually occur multiple times per day.\n- Absence seizures are seen in several generalized epilepsies, including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).\n- Episodes of behavioral arrest should be called \u201cstaring spells\u201d until an EEG evaluation is performed. Patients can only be diagnosed with absence epilepsy if they have characteristic seizure semiology and EEG findings.\n- Staring spells can be epileptic or nonepileptic, with the majority being nonepileptic. When episodes are epileptic, they may be due to absence seizures or focal seizures with impaired awareness (complex partial seizures).\n- The first-line treatment for absence seizures is ethosuximide. Other therapies include valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Second-line medications that can be used as adjunct therapy include zonisamide and levetiracetam.\n- Carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, vigabatrin, and other medications with similar mechanisms of action can worsen absence epilepsy.\n- Approximately 60% of patients with CAE eventually achieve seizure freedom.\n- Lack of response to ethosuximide and the presence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures have been associated with a lack of seizure remission and life-long epilepsy."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nNeurologists are key to managing absence seizures. However, the long-term care and monitoring are done by an interprofessional team that includes the neurologist (child neurologist in the case of the pediatric population), primary care physician, advanced care practitioner, nurse, and pharmacist. Physicians and advanced care practitioners must possess a nuanced understanding of absence seizure diagnosis and management, employing evidence-based practices with ethical considerations. The primary care practitioner, together with the neurologist, should follow up on the liver function tests, amylase, and complete blood count. In addition, birth control should be managed in women taking valproic acid. Finally, drug levels should be monitored periodically as these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. Nurses play a crucial role in managing absence seizures by closely monitoring patients for seizure activity, documenting symptoms, and promptly alerting the healthcare team to any changes. Additionally, they educate patients on medication adherence, seizure triggers, and safety precautions, empowering them and caregivers to effectively manage the condition outside clinical settings. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance. In addition, the pharmacist should ask about any adverse reaction at the time of dispensing the medication. The caregiver should be asked if the symptoms are controlled; if not, the pharmacist should communicate with the interprofessional team about the need for a change in the agent used or dosage. A few patients with intractable absence epilepsy may be candidates for the ketogenic diet. If this is the case, a registered dietician with expertise in this diet should be consulted and periodically evaluate the patient."
