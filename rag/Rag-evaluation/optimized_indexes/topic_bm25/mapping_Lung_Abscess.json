Introduction\nA lung abscess is characterized as a localized collection of pus or necrotic tissue within the lung parenchyma, resulting in a cavity. Once a bronchopulmonary fistula develops, this cavity often exhibits an air-fluid level. Lung abscesses belong to the broader category of lung infections, including lung gangrene and necrotizing pneumonia, with the latter marked by multiple abscess formations. Lung abscesses are typically categorized based on duration as either an acute abscess, which resolves in less than 6 weeks, or a chronic abscess, which persists for more than 6 weeks. A lung abscess may also be classified according to the underlying etiology. Primary lung abscess results from oropharyngeal secretion aspiration. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions may be secondary to various conditions, including dental or periodontal infections, sinusitis, altered states of consciousness, swallowing disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, frequent vomiting, necrotizing pneumonia, or immunocompromised individuals. Secondary lung abscesses arise from pulmonary conditions, including bronchial obstructions (eg, tumors, foreign bodies, or enlarged lymph nodes), existing lung conditions (eg, bronchiectasis, bullous emphysema, cystic fibrosis, infected pulmonary infarcts, or lung contusions). A lung abscess may also be classified according to the pathophysiologic mechanism of spread from extrapulmonary sites, which can be hematogenous (eg, abdominal sepsis, infective endocarditis, infected catheters, or septic thromboembolisms) or direct (eg, bronchoesophageal fistulas or subphrenic abscesses). Early symptoms mimic pneumonia, including fever, chills, cough, night sweats, and chest pain, with a productive cough developing as a hallmark sign. Diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT) scans and thoracic ultrasounds, is essential for characterizing lung abscesses."

Diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT) scans and thoracic ultrasounds, is essential for characterizing lung abscesses. Etiology\nPrimary lung abscesses are generally solitary and develop in otherwise healthy patients without preexisting medical conditions. In contrast, secondary lung abscesses arise in individuals with underlying or predisposing conditions; often, secondary lung abscesses comprise multiple abscess collections. The abscess can be described as nonspecific if no likely pathogen is recognized in the expectorated sputum or as a putrid abscess if the cause is presumed to be an anaerobic bacteria. The classification depends on the microorganism causing the abscess. In the majority of cases, the causative pathogen is polymicrobial, which includes anaerobic bacteria (eg, _Bacteroides_ , _Prevotella_ , _Peptostreptococcus_ , _Fusobacterium_ , or streptococci). A monomicrobial lung abscess is typically caused by streptococci, _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Streptococcus pyogenes_ , _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ , _Hemophilus influenzae_ type b, _Nocardia_ , or _Actinomyces_.\nIn patients with alcohol use disorder, the most common underlying organisms of a lung abscess include _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , _Streptococcus pyogenes_ , and _Actinomyces_. Poor dental hygiene is an independent risk factor for the development of lung abscesses. The incidence of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ complex infection is greater in lung transplant recipients than in other solid organ transplant recipients. This increased incidence is primarily because lung transplant recipients need higher levels of immunosuppression posttransplant than other solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, lung transplant recipients possess numerous donor-derived dendritic cells capable of activating T-cells and may encounter environmental antigens that could lead to graft rejection."

Additionally, lung transplant recipients possess numerous donor-derived dendritic cells capable of activating T-cells and may encounter environmental antigens that could lead to graft rejection. Evaluation\nChest radiographs and CT aid in the diagnosis of a lung abscess. Differentiating between lung abscesses and pulmonary cystic lesions, including intrapulmonary bronchial cysts, sequestration, or secondary infected emphysematous bullae, can be challenging. However, the lesion's location and clinical signs often guide the diagnosis. Localized pleural empyema can be distinguished using a CT scan (**Image**. Computed Tomography of a Lung Abscess) or ultrasound. The radiological sign of an air-fluid level can also be seen in hydatid cysts of the lung.\nSputum examination helps identify microbiological agents or confirm bronchial carcinoma. Microbiologic analysis of sputum can potentially assist in management. If the patient presents with risk factors for fungi or mycobacteria in their history, particular cultures should be requested. Diagnostic bronchoscopy is crucial for obtaining material for microbiological examination and confirming an intrabronchial cause of the abscess, such as a tumor or foreign body. Pleural fluid analysis and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage also have been utilized in rare cases. Lung abscesses are more prone to develop over the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and middle lobe followed by the superior segment of the right lower lobe and sometimes of the left lung in case of aspiration of oropharyngeal contents. Complicated lung abscess can cause pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema. In such cases, pleural fluid analysis can aid in diagnosis. Lung abscesses in patients who are immunocompromised have an increased risk of complications. However, immunocompetent patients with adequate treatment have a decreased risk of complications and usually resolve in 3 weeks. Furthermore, in cases of lung abscesses secondary to hematologic spread, blood cultures and echocardiography are essential in determining the appropriate management."

However, immunocompetent patients with adequate treatment have a decreased risk of complications and usually resolve in 3 weeks. Furthermore, in cases of lung abscesses secondary to hematologic spread, blood cultures and echocardiography are essential in determining the appropriate management. Treatment / Management\nClinicians should consider empiric antibiotic therapy in patients suspected of having a lung abscess. Empiric coverage should target colonized organisms in the upper airway and oropharynx, including gram-positive cocci, gram-negative cocci, and aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. If the patient is exposed to healthcare set 3 months before the presentation, coverage for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) should be considered. Atypical organisms can be found in the setting of an abscess that is not improving with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Poor prognostic factors include individuals who are older or with severe comorbidities, immunosuppression, bronchial obstruction, and neoplasms. Beta-lactamase inhibitors (eg, ticarcillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam) are the preferred initial empiric antibiotic therapy followed by imipenem or meropenem. Clindamycin, as an empiric treatment for lung abscess, is no longer recommended given the risk of _Clostridium difficile_ infection, but it remains an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. For MRSA, vancomycin or linezolid are preferred. Daptomycin has no activity against pulmonary infections. For methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ , preferred pharmacologic treatments are cefazolin 2 g intravenously (IV) every 8 hours, nafcillin 2 gm IV every 4 hours, or oxacillin 2 gm IV every 4 hours. Dosing adjustment is considered in patients with compromised renal function. Antibiotic duration is usually around 3 weeks but varies depending on clinical response. Clinicians should consider switching to oral antibiotics once patients are afebrile, stable, and able to tolerate an oral diet. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the drug of choice for oral antibiotics for lung abscesses. Metronidazole, as a single therapy, does not appear particularly useful due to polymicrobial flora."

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the drug of choice for oral antibiotics for lung abscesses. Metronidazole, as a single therapy, does not appear particularly useful due to polymicrobial flora. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nEffective management of lung abscesses requires a coordinated interprofessional approach involving physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals to enhance patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team performance. Identifying patients at high risk for aspiration and implementing strict aspiration precautions is crucial, as inhalation of oropharyngeal contents is a significant risk factor for developing lung abscesses. Physicians and advanced practitioners play a pivotal role in diagnosing and treating aspiration pneumonia promptly to prevent progression to lung abscesses. Nurses are vital in recognizing and communicating the need for increased monitoring of patients with restricted mobility, including those with cerebral vascular accidents, severe Parkinson's disease, severe Alzheimer's disease, or postoperative status, who are at higher risk for aspiration. Pharmacists contribute by ensuring appropriate antibiotic regimens are administered, considering potential drug interactions and contraindications, especially in complex cases involving broad-spectrum antibiotics or patients with a history of healthcare exposure requiring MRSA coverage. Physical therapists and respiratory therapists provide essential chest physiotherapy and physical therapy to prevent bedbound status and respiratory muscle fatigue, thereby reducing the risk of aspiration. Interprofessional communication and care coordination are essential for the timely recognition and management of lung abscesses. This involves regular team meetings, shared electronic health records for real-time information exchange, and collaborative decision-making to adjust treatment plans based on patient responses. Diagnostic tools such as chest radiographs, CT scans, sputum examination, and bronchoscopy require input from radiologists and pulmonologists to guide accurate diagnosis and treatment. In complex cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, requiring coordination with thoracic surgeons. Vigilant monitoring and early intervention can prevent complications such as pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema in immunocompromised patients."
