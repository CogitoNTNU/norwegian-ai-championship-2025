    "text": "Mechanism of Action\nAcetaminophen is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic medications. Although the exact mechanism of action of the drug remains unclear, it is historically categorized along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to its inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. Acetaminophen possesses analgesic and antipyretic properties similar to NSAIDs but lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Acetaminophen may inhibit the COX pathway in the central nervous system (CNS) but not in peripheral tissues. In addition, acetaminophen does not appear to bind to the active site of either the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. Instead, it reduces the activity of COX through an alternative mechanism. There is also a theoretical proposition that acetaminophen inhibits a splice variant of COX-1, referred to as COX-3, although this hypothesis has not been verified in humans. Regardless, the reduction of the COX pathway activity by acetaminophen is thought to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins in the CNS, leading to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. The analgesic properties may be due to a stimulating effect on the descending serotonergic pathways in the CNS. Additional research has proposed that acetaminophen or one of its metabolites, AM404, may activate the cannabinoid system. This activation could occur by inhibiting the uptake or degradation of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, thereby contributing to its analgesic action. AM404 exerts analgesic effects through dual modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the spinal cord dorsal horn. This involves facilitating spontaneous transmission and inhibiting C-fiber\u2013evoked transmission, achieved via activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype-1 (TRPV1) receptors. **Pharmacokinetics**\n**Absorption:** Oral acetaminophen is rapidly and efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes. Intravenous (IV) administration of acetaminophen resulted in immediate and higher peak plasma concentrations. The rectal route is preferred for administration to bypass first-pass metabolism, especially in unconscious patients and children."

Intravenous (IV) administration of acetaminophen resulted in immediate and higher peak plasma concentrations. The rectal route is preferred for administration to bypass first-pass metabolism, especially in unconscious patients and children. This approach offers an alternative to parenteral administration, thereby mitigating gastric irritation and enabling efficient absorption due to the rich vascular supply in the rectum. Absorption in the upper rectum guides medications into the portal circulation through the superior hemorrhoidal vein, whereas lower rectal absorption results in direct entry into the systemic circulation. **Distribution:** Acetaminophen exhibits low plasma protein binding of 10% to 25% and shows extensive distribution throughout the body, excluding fat tissue. **Metabolism:** Acetaminophen undergoes primarily hepatic metabolism via first-order kinetics, utilizing 3 distinct pathways\u2014conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation facilitated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, predominantly CYP2E1. CYP3A4 plays a limited role in acetaminophen metabolism. This process forms a reactive intermediate metabolite known as _N_ -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). At therapeutic doses, NAPQI swiftly combines with glutathione, subsequently undergoing further metabolism to generate cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. **Elimination:** Most acetaminophen metabolites are excreted in the urine, with less than 5% appearing as unconjugated or free acetaminophen. Over 90% of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours."

Administration\n**Available Dosage Forms**\nAcetaminophen can be administered through oral, rectal, or IV routes. - Oral: Acetaminophen is available in various formulations, including tablets, capsules, syrup, oral solution, or suspension. - Rectal: Acetaminophen is available as a rectal suppository for adult and pediatric patients. - IV: Acetaminophen is also available as an IV infusion for administration. Tompkins et al conducted a literature review on the effectiveness of IV acetaminophen in postoperative pain control. The investigators found a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of IV acetaminophen when compared to oral or rectal acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, or placebo across various surgical procedures, including abdominal, gynecological, genitourinary, orthopedic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and renal surgeries. The investigators conclude that IV acetaminophen offers limited clinical benefits compared to oral or rectal administration. Establishing the maximum daily allowable dosage of acetaminophen involves considering all modes of administration, including IV, oral, and rectal, as well as all formulations containing acetaminophen. **Dosages for Adults and Adolescents**\n**Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight of \u226550 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours. Notably, the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen should not exceed 4000 mg.\n**Adults and adolescents (13 or older) with a body weight \\<50 kg:** The recommended dosage of acetaminophen is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the minimum dosing interval is 4 hours."

In addition, it is essential to adhere to a maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen not exceeding 75 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 3750 mg.\n**Specific Patient Populations**\n**Hepatic impairment:** Acetaminophen is contraindicated in cases of active liver disease or severe hepatic impairment. Caution is advised for patients with mild hepatic impairment, necessitating a reduced total daily dosage of acetaminophen and regular monitoring of liver function. **Renal impairment:** In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u226430 mL/min), extending dosing intervals and reducing the total daily dosage of acetaminophen may be advisable. **Pregnancy considerations:** Observational studies have associated prenatal acetaminophen exposure with potential reproductive and neurobehavioral effects, including the risks of cryptorchidism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder with prenatal APAP exposure. However, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers acetaminophen safe for pregnant individuals. ACOG emphasizes that current evidence does not conclusively link acetaminophen use to fetal developmental issues. As neurodevelopmental disorders have multifactorial origins and brain development extends beyond birth, allowing for various potential influences, obstetricians must maintain current practices until further research provides more clarity. **Breastfeeding considerations:** Acetaminophen is suitable for pain relief and fever reduction in breastfeeding mothers. The levels detected in breast milk are significantly lower than typical infant doses, and there are infrequent reports of adverse effects in breastfed infants. **Pediatric populations:** The recommended dosage for children aged 2 to 12 is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen is 75 mg/kg. - Neonates: The recommended dosage for premature children born at \u226532 weeks gestational age or less than 28 days old is 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, with a maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen set at 50 mg/kg."

Adverse Effects\nCommon adverse effects associated with oral or rectal administration of acetaminophen may include skin rash, hypersensitivity reactions, nephrotoxicity characterized by elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and pancytopenia. In addition, it may cause metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, which may manifest as decreased serum bicarbonate, reduced concentrations of sodium and calcium, hyperammonemia, hyperchloremia, hyperuricemia, increased serum glucose, and elevated levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.\nAdditional adverse effects associated with IV administration of acetaminophen include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and abdominal pain.\nRare but serious adverse effects include hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions, and severe and fatal skin reactions. These include toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In addition, there have been reported instances of a rare pneumonia resulting from drug-induced lung injury due to acetaminophen.\n**Drug-Drug Interactions**\n**Warfarin** : Prolonged oral administration of acetaminophen at 4000 mg/d has been associated with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin. Due to the lack of studies evaluating short-term acetaminophen use with oral anticoagulants, increased frequency of INR monitoring may be advisable in these situations.\n**Alcohol** : Chronic alcohol misuse increases the risk of acetaminophen toxicity by inducing CYP2E1, reducing hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, and impairing NAPQI detoxification. Moreover, it may decrease glucuronidation, enhance oxidation, cause hepatocyte membrane disruptions, and reduce biliary excretion."

Contraindications\nContraindications to using acetaminophen include hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, severe hepatic impairment, or severe active hepatic disease.\n**Box Warnings**\n**Hepatotoxicity:** Acetaminophen use has been associated with liver failure, occasionally resulting in liver transplants or fatalities. The hepatotoxicity observed with acetaminophen use usually corresponds to high doses that surpass the recommended maximum dose. This effect may be associated with the consumption of multiple drug products containing acetaminophen as an ingredient. Liver damage has also been documented in patients with chronic acetaminophen dosing.\n**Dosing errors:** A notable FDA-box warning underscores the importance of preventing dosing errors, especially when administering acetaminophen to pediatric patients. In addition, it underscores the necessity of ensuring that the total daily dose of acetaminophen does not exceed the recommended maximum when accounting for all medications containing acetaminophen.\nAlthough these effects, warnings, and associations have been documented, acetaminophen remains a safe and effective medication when used accurately. The current manufacturer dose recommendation is restricted to between 3 and 3.25 g in 24 hours, depending on the formulation. However, toxicity is rare at doses less than 200 mg/kg for a child or 150 mg/kg for adults."

However, toxicity is rare at doses less than 200 mg/kg for a child or 150 mg/kg for adults. Monitoring\nPatients undergoing acetaminophen treatment should undergo monitoring for desired clinical effects, such as pain or fever relief. Serum concentrations are unnecessary when appropriately dosed. In overdose situations, laboratory evaluation becomes necessary. In acute overdoses where ingestion occurs in less than 8 hours, a serum APAP concentration should be assessed and plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. The time course should start at the onset of ingestion to determine toxicity and the need for treatment. For nonacute ingestions, assessing acetaminophen concentration and transaminases is required, and treatment should be administered. Furthermore, caution is warranted for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, alcoholic liver disease, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or severe hypovolemia. However, there is evidence suggesting that acetaminophen may be deemed safe for use in the context of alcoholic liver disease. Although acetaminophen can traverse the placental barrier, there is no evidence indicating an elevation in teratogenic effects when normal dosages of acetaminophen are used during pregnancy. In addition, acetaminophen is excreted into breast milk, with few observed instances of adverse reactions in nursing infants. Pregnant women are advised to exercise caution when using acetaminophen early in pregnancy due to emerging evidence suggesting that in-utero exposure to acetaminophen may elevate the risk of neurological, reproductive, and urogenital disorders in the fetus. A study by Alemany et al investigated prenatal and postnatal acetaminophen exposure in relation to Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) and ADHD. Acetaminophen exposure was assessed in 73,881 mother-child pairs through questionnaires or interviews. Children aged 4 to 12 exhibiting symptoms of ASC or ADHD were evaluated using well-documented instruments."

However, postnatal acetaminophen exposure did not show an association with ASC or ADHD symptoms. MacIntyre et al conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial to investigate the effects of oral acetaminophen on daytime systolic blood pressure. One hundred and ten subjects were randomized to receive 1 g of acetaminophen 4 times a day or a placebo for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period before receiving the alternative treatment. Daytime systolic blood pressure was assessed in subjects who received either acetaminophen or a placebo. The investigators observed a 5-mmHg increase in daytime systolic blood pressure among those who received a daily dose of 4 g of acetaminophen. As a result, the researchers concluded that the use of high-dose acetaminophen in hypertensive patients could potentially elevate their risk of cardiovascular disease."

Toxicity\nEach year, approximately 500 fatalities and 50,000 emergency department admissions in the United States are linked to acetaminophen. In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases. Acetaminophen is the most prevalent drug-related cause of acute liver failure, with hepatic injury occurring as a consequence of the drug's metabolism properties. After reaching therapeutic concentrations of oral acetaminophen, 60% to 90% of the drug undergoes metabolism in the liver, forming glucuronic acid- and sulfate-conjugate metabolites. A smaller fraction, approximately 5% to 15%, undergoes metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450)\u2014metabolism primarily through CYP2E1 results in the formation of the toxic intermediate NAPQI. Under normal circumstances, NAPQI is neutralized by glutathione to form nontoxic metabolites. However, in the case of excessive doses of acetaminophen, the normal phase II drug metabolism pathways become depleted. The CYP450 pathway metabolizes a more significant portion of the acetaminophen, leading to elevated concentrations of NAPQI formation, and the limited glutathione stores can deplete. When there is a shortage of glutathione, NAPQI concentrations increase, and, as a reactive intermediate, it can react with essential cellular macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This interaction can result in centrilobular (zone 3) hepatic injury and hepatocellular death, along with the potential for nephrotoxicity. The only approved antidote for acetaminophen overdose and toxicity is _N_ -acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC acts as a precursor to glutathione synthesis, aiding in restoring intracellular glutathione stores to neutralize the NAPQI compound, directly inactivating NAPQI. NAC can be administered orally or via the IV route. The IV administration of NAC is typically preferred because vomiting is common with acetaminophen overdose."

NAC can be administered orally or via the IV route. The IV administration of NAC is typically preferred because vomiting is common with acetaminophen overdose. NAC administration follows a 20-hour IV or 72-hour oral protocol, and clinicians must monitor aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels during treatment. Notably, the majority of patients do not exhibit symptoms in the initial hours after ingesting toxic doses of acetaminophen. During this early period, symptoms may be limited to abdominal pain and nausea, persisting for the first 12 to 24 hours. Although these symptoms may alleviate between 24 and 72 hours, AST/ALT concentrations may remain abnormal. Patients presenting more than 24 hours after ingesting toxic doses of acetaminophen may manifest symptoms including nausea, vomiting, jaundice, abdominal pain, and hypotension. The management of these patients may involve interventions such as airway management, IV fluids, vasopressors, and addressing symptoms such as cerebral edema as they arise. A recent consensus statement published by America's Poison Centers, American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, American College of Medical Toxicology, and Canadian Association of Poison Control Centers addresses acetaminophen toxicity. NAC is administered through oral or IV routes, with the initial dose administered promptly upon identifying the need for treatment. The panel recommends a regimen providing a minimum of 300 mg/kg, either orally or IV, within the initial 20 to 24 hours of treatment. Nevertheless, the comparative effectiveness of various regimens still requires evaluation. The guidelines emphasize the importance of continuous assessment and caution against prematurely discontinuing treatment. Notably, a common clinical error involves administering NAC for 20 or 21 hours and then discontinuing without reassessing the patient. The panel chose to refine the Rumack-Matthew nomogram by retaining only the lines indicating clinical action. In this refined approach, the blood concentration of APAP is directly plotted on the nomogram, and NAC is administered to patients whose concentration exceeds the treatment line. Stopping criteria for NAC include an acetaminophen concentration below 10 \u03bcg/dL, an INR level below 2, normal levels of AST/ALT, or a decrease in AST/ALT by 25% to 50%, provided the patient is clinically stable."

High-risk ingestion involves the consumption of at least 30 g of acetaminophen or an acetaminophen concentration surpassing the high-risk line on the nomogram. These cases are managed similarly to other acetaminophen overdoses, with consideration for the extended administration of activated charcoal, especially if the ingestion occurred more than 4 hours prior due to prolonged absorption. In addition, consultation with a clinical toxicologist may be required for an increased NAC dosage. In managing repeated supratherapeutic ingestion in 24 hours, unlike acute ingestion cases, treatment is based on signs and symptoms. If the acetaminophen concentration exceeds 20 \u03bcg/mL or AST levels or ALT are abnormal, NAC should be administered until the established stopping criteria are met. Extended-release acetaminophen products, intended for 8-hour use in the United States or Canada, are managed similarly to other acetaminophen products. Activated charcoal may continue to be effective for longer than 4 hours after ingestion, especially when evidence indicates ongoing absorption, such as an increasing acetaminophen concentration. NAC is required if the acetaminophen concentration from samples drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion surpasses the nomogram treatment line. In cases where the concentration from samples drawn 4 to 12 hours after ingestion falls below the treatment line but remains above 10 \u03bcg/mL, a follow-up measurement should be taken 4 to 6 hours after the initial assessment. In simultaneous ingestion with anticholinergic or opioid agonists, the concern is the potential for delays or prolongation of acetaminophen absorption. The management approach aligns with that of other acetaminophen products. If the initial acetaminophen concentration measured 4 to 24 hours after ingestion is 10 \u03bcg/mL or lower, further measurements are unnecessary, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment is not required. Conversely, if any concentration exceeds the treatment line, NAC is indicated."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe prevention of acetaminophen toxicity is of utmost importance, and an interprofessional healthcare team comprising clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists plays a critical role. Pharmacists and nurses need to emphasize the daily maximum permitted dose of acetaminophen. Patients should be educated on identifying acetaminophen in various medications and calculating the dosages when combining products. Pharmacists are responsible for conducting medication reconciliation to assess potential drug interactions and ensuring that the patient's regimen does not include an excessive amount of acetaminophen-containing drugs. Pharmacists should report any concerns to the nurse and prescriber. All healthcare team members must document their findings and inform the entire team regarding the patient's case. With the recent changes in maximum daily dosing for acetaminophen, all interprofessional healthcare team members must be aware of the new guidelines, and they should remain current and stay vigilant for any emerging guidance in the field. In cases of toxicity or suspicion of toxicity, effective management necessitates the collaboration of an interprofessional team comprising clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Specific protocols have been designed to direct the interprofessional healthcare team when patients present to emergency departments with acute acetaminophen toxicity. Developing such protocols involves the input of emergency physicians, nurses, toxicologists, pharmacists, and psychiatrists. Furthermore, dentists can also become involved when the overdose is secondary to dental procedures. As outlined above, patients should receive clear instructions on APAP medication management upon discharge."

    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nPain is one of the most common reasons a patient seeks medical care. Various modalities may be used to relieve pain, and one of them is the administration of opiates. Opiates and opioids are strong pain relievers derived from the plant _Papaver somniferum_. Conventionally, the term \"opiates\" refers to natural compounds obtained from the poppy flower base, while \"opioids\" are synthetic agents with similar effects. Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years, and these drugs have been assumed to be relatively safe despite the potential consequences of overdosing, including central nervous system and respiratory depression resulting in arrest. However, many reports in the last 2 decades have raised concerns about the safety of these drugs. Opiate prescriptions have dramatically increased over this period, with the United States currently experiencing an opioid epidemic with fatal consequences. Overdose and toxicity cases are on the rise and are continually reported in all major cities. Empirical prescription habits by healthcare workers to relieve pain have also led to an epidemic of overdose outside the healthcare setting, with the eruption of clandestine laboratories manufacturing synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and distributing them on the street. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing opioid toxicity. Participants gain a deeper understanding of the condition's risk factors, etiology, toxicology, pathophysiology, presentations, and evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The course highlights the use of opioid reversal agents such as naloxone to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Introduction\nThe term \"opiate\" refers to natural compounds derived from the base of the _Papaver somniferum_ poppy flower, such as opium, morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), and codeine. In contrast, opioids are synthesized through chemical processes and include methadone, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Opiates have been used since antiquity to relieve pain and induce euphoria. Today, these agents remain a widely used option for pain relief. Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years and have long been assumed to be relatively safe and nonaddictive when used for chronic pain. In 1995, Dr. James Campbell addressed the American Pain Society, advocating for the evaluation of pain as a vital sign. His intentions were well-meaning, motivated by concerns about the undertreatment of pain. However, over the past 2 decades, numerous reports have raised alarms about the safety of these drugs. Cases of overdose and opiate toxicity are reported regularly across major cities in the United States. Particularly concerning is the dramatic increase in opiate prescriptions over the same period. This widespread prescribing by healthcare providers has contributed to an epidemic of overdoses outside the healthcare setting. Consequently, practicing healthcare professionals should recognize opiate toxicity in patients who present as lethargic or unresponsive without an apparent cause. (CDC, 2017)\nData released by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that, from 2001 through 2010, the rates of opiate diversion, opiate prescriptions, and opiate-related deaths exponentially increased in the United States. These rates plateaued from 2011 through 2013 but spiked again between 2013 and 2014. Experts in pain management believe that the high number of opiate overdoses is likely unintentional, as patients may have been attempting to manage unrelenting pain."

Experts in pain management believe that the high number of opiate overdoses is likely unintentional, as patients may have been attempting to manage unrelenting pain. (CDC, 2016)\nPrescriptions for opioid-containing medications quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, paralleling a 4-fold increase in overdose deaths due to opioids. The majority of opioid-related deaths are attributed to the use of heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone. The issue of poorly treated pain has led medical professionals to use various short- and long-acting opiates. While this approach has significantly improved pain relief, some patients often fail to adhere to proper dosing. When patients increase the dose or duration of opioid use, toxicity becomes a potential complication. Although the annual rates of transition are low, toxicity often occurs when individuals move from the nonmedical use of prescription opioids to heroin. Opioid overdose occurs when excessive unopposed stimulation of the opiate pathway leads to decreased respiratory effort and, potentially, death. The frequency of opioid overdoses is rapidly increasing. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with opioids being the most common culprit. According to the CDC, more than 1,000 emergency department visits reported daily are related to opioid misuse, and about 91 opioid overdose deaths are documented every day. Heroin, priced at about $2 per bag, is up to 10 times cheaper and more readily available than prescription opioid medications purchased on the street, which average around a dollar per milligram. Additionally, heroin is increasingly being mixed with fentanyl and other synthetic opioid compounds, resulting in variable opioid potency and a higher risk of overdose. Nonpharmaceutical or \"street\" opioids are often contaminated with other substances. To increase profits, sellers frequently add additional agents to the formula without informing the end user. These additives are pharmacologically active in many cases. Heroin was adulterated with scopolamine 2 decades ago in New York City, causing severe anticholinergic toxicity. Cocaine adulteration is also prevalent. **Prescription Monitoring**\nMost states have established prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to counter the liberal prescribing of opiates by healthcare workers."

Cocaine adulteration is also prevalent. **Prescription Monitoring**\nMost states have established prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to counter the liberal prescribing of opiates by healthcare workers. Etiology\nBoth opioids and opiates act on 3 major classes of opioid receptors: \u03bc, \u03ba, \u03b4, and several minor classes, such as nociceptin and \u03b6. Simply put, \u03bc-receptors are thought to provide analgesia, respiratory suppression, bradycardia, physical dependence, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and euphoria. Agonism of \u03ba-receptors can lead to hallucinations, miosis, and dysphoria. The \u03b4-receptor likely contributes to pain control and mood modulation, but some suggest that \u03bc agonism is necessary for the \u03b4-receptor to function effectively in analgesia. Causes of opioid overdose include substance abuse, unintentional and intentional overdose, and therapeutic drug error.\nThe risk of opioid overdose increases in the following situations:\n- Taking escalating doses\n- Returning to use after cessation\n- Having severe medical and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, HIV infection, and lung or liver disease\n- Combining opioids with sedative medications\n- Being male\n- Being younger (20 to 40 years)\n- Being of White non-Hispanic race\nMore than 1.5 million emergency department visits are related to opioid analgesic use. Opioid overdose is a common cause of death."

    "text": "Opioid overdose is a common cause of death. Epidemiology\n**Impact of the Opioid Crisis in the United States**\nOpiates are frequently prescribed for moderate to severe pain in the United States. These drugs may be prescribed alone or combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants. Based on data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders Systems, the percentage increases in opiate use from 2004 through 2011 were as follows:\n- Buprenorphine 2318%\n- Fentanyl 35%\n- Hydromorphone 140%\n- Methadone 37%\n- Morphine 64%\n- Oxycodone 117%\nMeanwhile, the use of codeine decreased by 20%. Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has revealed that abuse of all the above opiates increased, with hydromorphone and buprenorphine leading the way with a 438% and 384% increase, respectively. (SAMHSA, 2014) Other reports from DAWN reveal that nearly 420,000 documented emergency room visits in 2013 were related to opiates. Cases of abuse and diversion of opiates over the past decade have included drugs like hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. In 2015, United States poison control centers reported a total of 18,425 exposures to pure opiates, which resulted in 68 fatalities and 764 cases of major toxicity. Additionally, 14,632 cases involved exposure to combinations of opiates with alcohol, benzodiazepines, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. The combined exposures resulted in 32 fatalities and 288 cases of severe toxicity. (AAPCC, 2017) The opioid crisis was reported to claim about 128 lives per day in 2018. **Global Consequences of the Opioid Epidemic**\nThe opiate toxicity epidemic is not limited to the United States but is also a worldwide concern. According to the 2014 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, at least 0.4% of the population, or nearly 20 million people, regularly use heroin or opium. The highest usage rates are found in Southwest Asia (1.21%), followed by Southeastern and Eastern Europe (0.83%), and Transcaucasia and Central Asia (0.81%)."

The highest usage rates are found in Southwest Asia (1.21%), followed by Southeastern and Eastern Europe (0.83%), and Transcaucasia and Central Asia (0.81%). Pathophysiology\nOpioids exert their clinical effects by interacting with the opioid receptor, which has 3 subtypes: \u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4. These receptors are all G-protein-linked and are found throughout the human body. Each subtype produces different clinical manifestations when activated. \u03bc-receptors mediate analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and physical dependence. These receptors reduce the medullary response to hypercarbia and decrease the respiratory response to hypoxia, leading to a diminished stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea. \u03bc-receptors are concentrated in the brain, where they regulate analgesia; in the mesolimbic system, which is responsible for euphoria and reward; and in the medulla, which regulates respiration. \u03ba-receptors mediate analgesia, diuresis, miosis, and dysphoria primarily within the spinal cord. Stimulation of this receptor subtype is not associated with constipation or significant changes in respiration. \u03bc-receptor-specific antagonists do not reverse analgesia provided by \u03ba-receptor stimulation. \u03b4-receptors mediate analgesia, inhibit dopamine release, and suppress cough. Less is known about the stimulation of this receptor, but it is believed to play a smaller role in behavior reinforcement. Opioids may be agonists, partial agonists, or agonist-antagonists of opioid receptors, which are located in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract. In overdose, excessive stimulation of the \u03bc-opioid receptors in the brain that regulate respiratory rate leads to respiratory depression and, ultimately, death by respiratory arrest. The typical symptoms of overdose include pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression, and a decreased level of consciousness, which, together, form the \u201copioid overdose triad.\u201d\nThe roles of the \u03c3- and \u03b4-opioid receptors are less well understood. However, hallucinations, dysphoria, and psychosis may develop when \u03c3-receptors are stimulated."

However, hallucinations, dysphoria, and psychosis may develop when \u03c3-receptors are stimulated. Toxicokinetics\nOpiates may be administered intravenously, topically, inhalationally, intramuscularly, and orally. Peak opiate effects are reached within 5 to 10 minutes following intravenous administration but may take up to 90 minutes if the oral route is used. Drugs like heroin and butorphanol can reach peak levels within 10 to 15 minutes after nasal insufflation and about 30 to 45 minutes following intramuscular injection. Fentanyl, which is the only available topical analgesic agent, often takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak levels. Most orally administered opiate is absorbed in the small intestine. Large opiate doses can lead to gastric aperistalsis and a delay in gastric emptying, resulting in increased absorption of the drug. Once in the body, opiates are metabolized by the liver into inactive compounds, which are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Opiates such as buprenorphine and fentanyl are highly lipid-soluble and tend to redistribute into fatty tissues, resulting in a prolonged half-life. Since all opiates are metabolized by the liver, they tend to have a long half-life when consumed in the presence of liver dysfunction (eg, cirrhosis). Opiate toxicity in patients with this condition can occur rapidly, even with small doses, as the drug remains in the body for an extended period. The hepatic microsomal CYP2D6 enzyme breaks down codeine into the active metabolite morphine. Some individuals carry more than 2 copies of the enzyme, making them ultrarapid metabolizers who quickly convert codeine into morphine. These people may develop morphine toxicity if they take even normal doses of codeine. This same mechanism of ultrarapid breakdown explains why tramadol may also cause opiate toxicity."

These people may develop morphine toxicity if they take even normal doses of codeine. This same mechanism of ultrarapid breakdown explains why tramadol may also cause opiate toxicity. After being metabolized in the liver, opiate metabolites are excreted in the urine. Individuals with renal dysfunction may experience adverse effects from the accumulation of active metabolites, such as normeperidine. Several studies indicate that long-acting opiates used for noncancer pain may increase the risk of adverse cardiac events compared to tricyclics or anticonvulsants. **Formulas of Opiates and Delivery**\nIn the past, opiates were only available in oral and injectable formulations. Today, dermal, sublingual, and inhaler formulas are also sold in the market. Butorphanol comes in an intranasal form, and fentanyl is available both as a topical and an inhaler. The transdermal delivery of opiates like fentanyl has become widely accepted in healthcare settings for analgesic relief. This delivery route is preferred because drug levels take 4 to 6 hours to peak, and the elimination half-life is long, making it suitable for patients with chronic, continuous pain. Additionally, this route rarely precipitates toxicity because of the relatively prolonged, slow onset of action. However, the topical formulation of fentanyl can contribute to the toxicity of parenteral and oral opiates. Dextromethorphan was once widely available in many over-the-counter cough preparations. However, this product is no longer sold without regulation because of diversion. Although dextromethorphan was an over-the-counter preparation, high doses were known to cause sedation and even respiratory depression due to its chemical similarity to codeine. Additionally, using dextromethorphan in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors can lead to life-threatening serotonin syndrome, which may result in adverse cardiac events. Tramadol (Ultram) is classified as a nonopiate analgesic. However, this product has a dual mode of action, acting on both nonopiate and opiate receptors. Tramadol has a comparatively long duration of action, lasting 5 to 6 hours. Naloxone administration is recommended for patients known to have overdosed on tramadol, with most individuals requiring repeated doses or a continuous intravenous infusion."

Naloxone administration is recommended for patients known to have overdosed on tramadol, with most individuals requiring repeated doses or a continuous intravenous infusion. Many clandestine laboratories have emerged across the nation due to the difficulty of legally obtaining prescription opiates. These laboratories operate under unsterile conditions and use impure substances, resulting in more toxic drugs being sold on the street. Another challenge with illicit drugs produced in clandestine laboratories is that many cannot be detected using standard toxicological screens because of their structural dissimilarities. Several synthetic fentanyl derivatives, such as \u03b1-methylfentanyl, are circulating on the street and are extremely potent. Multiple deaths have been reported, with users found with needles still in their arms. Another synthetic derivative, 3-methylfentanyl, is thousands of times more potent than morphine. Extremely high doses of intravenous naloxone infusions are required for people overdosing on this agent. Deaths from these fentanyl derivatives often occur in clusters, as sellers move from street to street, causing multiple fatalities along the way. Pentazocine is classified as a partial agonist-antagonist and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. This drug works by stimulating the \u03ba-opiate receptors and inhibiting the \u03bc-opiate receptors. The drug shares many adverse effects common to other opiates. However, a unique feature of pentazocine is its potential to cause nightmares, hallucinations, and delusions. Pentazocine has a high ceiling effect, meaning that a high dose must be reached before further drug administration stops providing additional pain relief, although the risk of side effects still increases. The pharmacological effects of pentazocine may be reversed by naloxone, but extremely high doses (10 to 115 mg) are required. Propoxyphene is an opiate analgesic once prescribed to manage mild pain and cough. Sporadic cases of poisoning with this drug continued even after it was withdrawn from the American market in 2010 due to concerns about serious adverse cardiac events. Despite the ban, the drug remains available illegally and contributes to a significant number of poisonings each year."

Despite the ban, the drug remains available illegally and contributes to a significant number of poisonings each year. Naloxone can reverse the toxicity of propoxyphene but does not address the cardiac arrhythmias caused by the drug. These arrhythmias, resulting from the quinidine-like effects of propoxyphene, are unresponsive to naloxone. Propoxyphene can cause sinus bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias. Immediate treatment involves the administration of sodium bicarbonate. The combination of diphenoxylate and atropine is commonly used to treat diarrhea. The opioid diphenoxylate acts as an antidiarrheal agent. The anticholinergic atropine is added to deter deliberate misuse and overdose. Atropine itself has no antidiarrheal activity. High doses of this combination can cause primarily anticholinergic side effects, respiratory depression, and constipation. Cardiac toxicity, including prolongation of the QRS and QTc intervals leading to ventricular arrhythmias, is the main concern with the use of this drug combination. **Body Packers and Stuffers**\nTransporting illicit drugs in the body has become increasingly common over the past 2 decades. These individuals, often called \"drug mules\" or \"carriers,\" ingest drugs contained in plastic bags or condoms. The number of packages ingested typically ranges from 1 to 3 dozen. Some may rupture despite being well-packaged, leading to systemic toxicity. Others may develop complications such as bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation, requiring surgery. Additionally, when pursued by law enforcement, these individuals may quickly swallow smaller quantities of drugs to evade arrest. Body stuffers are at a higher risk of adverse effects, as the drugs they transport are often improperly packaged. Symptoms can appear rapidly following ingestion, and aggressive medical intervention is often necessary to prevent overdose and death."

Symptoms can appear rapidly following ingestion, and aggressive medical intervention is often necessary to prevent overdose and death. History and Physical\n**History**\nMost patients who overdose on opiates are lethargic or comatose. Thus, the history is typically gathered from family, friends, bystanders, or emergency medical service providers. Pills, empty bottles, needles, syringes, and other drug paraphernalia are often found at the scene. Important details to obtain in the history include the amount of drug ingested, congestion, and time of ingestion. In some cases, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel may administer naloxone in the prehospital setting, which can help confirm the diagnosis of opiate overdose. **Physical Examination**\nPatients with opiate overdose commonly exhibit lethargy or a depressed level of consciousness. Opiate overdose also leads to respiratory depression, generalized central nervous system (CNS) impairment, and miosis. However, healthcare workers must recognize that miosis is not always present in every patient with opiate overdose, and other causes of CNS and respiratory depression should be considered. Additional signs of opiate overdose include euphoria, drowsiness, altered mental status, fresh needle marks, seizures, and conjunctival injection. **Skin evaluation**\nExamination of the extremities may reveal needle track marks in individuals who abuse intravenous opiates. Many people with substance use disorders also inject morphine and heroin subcutaneously. In some cases, opium oil may be inhaled, and individuals may have patch marks on their bodies from fentanyl use. Most opiates can trigger the release of histamine, leading to itching, skin flushing, and urticaria. **Pulmonary assessment**\nIn some morphine toxicity cases, respiratory distress and hypoxia may present with pupillary dilation. Additionally, drugs such as meperidine, morphine, propoxyphene, and diphenoxylate/atropine can cause midpoint pupils or frank mydriasis. Breathing is typically impaired in patients with morphine overdose."

Since opiates may also cause bronchoconstriction, some individuals may present with dyspnea, wheezing, and frothy sputum production. **Cardiovascular examination**\nMost opiates cause peripheral vasodilation, which can lead to moderate-to-severe hypotension. However, this hypotension may be reversed with changes in body position or fluid administration. Other coingestants must be considered if the hypotension is severe and unresponsive to fluids. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**\nNausea and vomiting are common in patients with opiate toxicity. These symptoms occur because opiates can induce gastric aperistalsis and slow down intestinal motility. **Psychiatric features**\nOpiates are generalized CNS depressants. However, these drugs can also cause anxiety, agitation, depression, dysphoria, hallucinations, nightmares, and paranoia. **Neurological assessment**\nOpiates can lower the seizure threshold, potentially leading to generalized seizures, particularly in young children. This effect is mainly due to the paradoxical excitation of the brain. The opiates most commonly involved in adults experiencing seizures are propoxyphene and meperidine. Hearing loss may occur in rare cases, particularly in individuals who have consumed alcohol with heroin. However, this auditory deficit is usually reversible."

Coingestants like tricyclics have the potential to cause arrhythmias. Treatment / Management\n**Prehospital Management**\nOften, the first responder at the scene of a suspected opioid overdose is a nonmedical individual, such as a police officer. As of 2016, over 1,214 law enforcement agencies have trained their officers to administer naloxone in the field. This community involvement has led to increased survival rates following overdose incidents in the Midwest United States. Emergency medical technicians must be aware of prearrival naloxone administration by law enforcement and its effects. In some cases, patients may experience a complete reversal of toxicity and refuse further medical care or transportation to an emergency department. Studies have shown low short-term mortality rates in these cases. However, the potential risks of recurrent toxicity must be explained to these individuals, as well as the associated morbidity and mortality. If EMS are the first responders, priority should be given to assessing airway and hemodynamic stability. Naloxone should be administered in cases of decreased respirations. If the individual has no intravenous access, naloxone may be given intramuscularly, intranasally, intraosseously, or endotracheally via an endotracheal tube. Data show that the intranasal route is as effective as the intramuscular route in the prehospital setting. However, naloxone may cause agitation and aggression when it reverses the opioid effects. The lowest naloxone dose necessary to reverse respiratory apnea should be administered in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Patients may become combative or violent in the ambulance, and restraints may be needed for the safety of both the patient and EMS personnel. If the patient remains unresponsive to naloxone, endotracheal intubation should be considered to protect the airway."

Additional information from EMS personnel should include the presence of any drugs or paraphernalia, the patient's initial presentation (including vital signs), any potential trauma, and details regarding the timing and specifics of the suspected overdose. EMS personnel at the scene may have already secured the airway by administering naloxone or performing endotracheal intubation in some cases. Emergency physicians should evaluate the patient's airway and breathing upon arrival and determine if further intervention is necessary. Immobilization should be prioritized if suspicion of occult trauma to the cervical spine arises. A capillary blood glucose level should be checked in any patient presenting with an unknown cause of lethargy or loss of consciousness, even if an overdose is highly suspected. Initial treatment of overdose starts with supportive care, including assistance with respiration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the absence of spontaneous circulation, and removal of any opioid agent, such as a patch or infusion. Naloxone should be administered immediately when an opioid overdose is suspected as the cause of respiratory and CNS depression, without delay for laboratory studies. **Naloxone administration**\nNaloxone is a pure competitive antagonist of opiate receptors and has no agonistic activity. The drug is relatively safe and may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or endotracheally, though research on tracheal absorption has been conducted only in animal models. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an intranasal formulation commonly used by first responders in patients without intravenous access. Intranasal naloxone is also available to the community. After naloxone administration, the onset of action occurs within minutes, regardless of the route. A second dose may be given every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed by 3 to 10 minutes."

A second dose may be given every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed by 3 to 10 minutes. The goal of naloxone administration is to restore adequate breathing and ensure a stable airway. Higher doses are required for patients who overdosed on diphenoxylate, methadone, butorphanol, nalbuphine, or pentazocine. A naloxone infusion can be started in patients who need repeated doses to maintain respiration. Nalmefene is a new agent on the market that can reverse opiate toxicity. This drug has a half-life of 4 to 8 hours. However, routine use of this longer-acting opiate antagonist is not recommended due to concerns about precipitating a prolonged period of opiate withdrawal. **Starting dose of naloxone**\nThe usual starting dose of naloxone for adults ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg. Meanwhile, the starting dose for children is 0.1 mg/kg. The goal of naloxone administration is to reverse respiratory depression, not to \"wake up\" the individual. Naloxone should be administered slowly in suspected chronic opiate users, with doses of 0.04 to 0.4 mg given intravenously every 1 to 3 minutes. This approach ensures a more controlled reversal of opiate effects and reduces the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Rapid administration of naloxone in these patients can trigger withdrawal, which is distressing for the patient and potentially places healthcare workers at risk of injury. Before naloxone administration, the patient should receive 100% fraction of inspired oxygen assisted by bag-valve ventilation until they become more alert and cooperative or until naloxone is administered. The onset of naloxone\u2019s action is immediate, with peak response occurring within 3 to 8 minutes. A repeat dose may be indicated if the patient continues to show signs of opiate toxicity. Starting with a low dose of naloxone is important, typically 0.05 to 0.1 mg intravenously, gradually titrating upward to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, agitation, pain, and aspiration. This careful dosing is especially crucial in patients suspected of ingesting opiates combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines."

Peripheral intravenous access may be difficult in some patients with opiate overdose and long-term OUD. In such cases, 2 mg of naloxone may be administered intramuscularly or intranasally. Even with this route, opiate toxicity is reversed within 5 to 10 minutes. The half-life of naloxone is about 30 to 45 minutes, with a duration of action ranging from 90 to 180 minutes. These variations depend on the route of administration and dose. Patients should be monitored for any recurrence of opioid toxicity, as the initial drug effect may last longer than naloxone\u2019s duration of action. An infusion may be started in patients requiring multiple bolus doses. The naloxone infusion dose is 3/4 of the amount required to reverse respiratory depression. Much higher doses of naloxone are usually needed to reverse toxicity in patients who have taken large doses of propoxyphene, methadone, diphenoxylate/atropine, or fentanyl. Repeat doses of 2 mg may be required every 3 to 4 minutes for a total of 10 mg. The diagnosis of opioid toxicity should be reconsidered in patients who fail to respond to 10 mg of naloxone. Many street opiate preparations are adulterated, and the response to naloxone may not always be complete. A steady naloxone infusion is generally preferred over intermittent dosing for treating large overdoses. However, a naloxone infusion should not be administered if intubation is necessary. Clinicians must be ready to intubate if the patient remains in respiratory distress. **Role of activated charcoal**\nActivated charcoal may be used to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in cases of oral opiate overdose, such as with body stuffers, if the patient is alert at the time of admission. Activated charcoal is typically effective only if administered within 1 hour of drug ingestion. However, opiates slow gastric motility, allowing activated charcoal to be given up to 2 to 3 hours after ingestion."

Whole bowel irrigation is not recommended for patients showing signs of ileus, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or an unprotected airway. **Additional measures**\nSome patients with opiate toxicity may not respond to high-dose naloxone treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that buprenorphine may be beneficial if the cause is determined to be an opiate and the patient is in respiratory arrest. **Intranasal administration of naloxone**\nNaloxone is highly effective when administered promptly, but its use has traditionally been limited to physicians and paramedics. With the rise in opioid overdoses, intranasal medication administration by bystanders is currently being advocated. Evidence supporting the efficacy of out-of-hospital naloxone administration is promising. The bioavailability of concentrated naloxone nasal spray has been shown to be around 25%. Fifty percent absorption occurs within 6 to 8 minutes, with maximum blood concentration reached at 20 minutes, making it a viable option for community and prehospital use. A retrospective study of Basic Life Support (BLS) crews administering prehospital intranasal naloxone over 6 years found that 95% of patients who received treatment showed clinical benefits before arrival. Less than 10% of patients required additional doses in the emergency department, and 70% were eventually discharged. **Opioid poisoning in children**\nThe dose of naloxone for children who are younger than 5 or weigh less than 20 kg is 0.1 mg/kg."

For children who are older than 5 or weigh more than 20 kg, the dose ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg. Repeat dosing may be required every 3 to 4 minutes, up to a maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg of naloxone. Repeat dosing is often necessary when the child has ingested longer-acting opiates like methadone. A continuous naloxone infusion may be started, but caution must be taken to avoid overhydration, which could lead to pulmonary edema. The pharmacy may assist with determining the correct concentration of fluid and naloxone for safe administration, but repeat bolus dosing may be safer if a concentrated infusion is unavailable. **Use of combined buprenorphine and naloxone**\nBuprenorphine, in combination with naloxone, is widely available and used to treat OUD in the outpatient setting. Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist and antagonist at the opioid receptor. Anecdotal data indicate that the risk of overdose is lower with buprenorphine/naloxone compared to methadone. Naloxone has no oral bioavailability and is included in the formulation to deter intravenous use. Unfortunately, the sublingual preparation of buprenorphine and naloxone may also be easily abused. **Naloxone adverse effects**\nNaloxone has demonstrated a very safe side effect profile. Studies on opioid-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, naloxone can trigger acute opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-tolerant patients. These symptoms may include sudden aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting, which occur in approximately 30% of patients. Most symptoms are mild and short-lived, with fewer than 1% of patients requiring admission. Acute withdrawal is more likely with higher doses of naloxone. A rare but potential side effect of naloxone is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is thought to result from a sudden catecholamine surge, typically following the administration of high doses of naloxone."

A rare but potential side effect of naloxone is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is thought to result from a sudden catecholamine surge, typically following the administration of high doses of naloxone. Treatment involves positive pressure ventilation, starting with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and escalating to endotracheal intubation if necessary. **Inpatient Care**\nMost patients who overdose on opiates and experience a reversal with naloxone are admitted for observation for at least 12 to 24 hours. Naloxone's duration of action is approximately 1 hour, and long-acting opiates may continue to cause sedation and respiratory depression. These patients are best monitored on a specialized floor. The majority of patients on heroin overdose are admitted due to the risk of acute lung injury, which often presents early. Individuals who are asymptomatic after a heroin overdose may not require 24-hour monitoring but still need 6 to 12 hours of observation before discharge, provided their vital signs remain stable. Admission is also recommended for patients requiring multiple doses or prolonged intravenous infusions of naloxone to maintain respiratory function. Admission is the safest course of action if the patient\u2019s clinical stability is in question. **Outpatient Care**\nGiven the association of opiate use with sudden respiratory difficulty, many healthcare professionals now advocate for take-home naloxone. Having naloxone at home is particularly beneficial for individuals at high risk of narcotic overdose. **Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act**\nThe Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act updates federal guidelines to expand access to evidence-based treatments for the opioid epidemic. This act enables all healthcare providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, similar to how they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act aims to reduce the stigma surrounding OUD treatment and promote its integration into general healthcare settings. The MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program as of December 2022. DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority are now permitted to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD within their practice, provided it aligns with applicable state laws. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) encourages providers to take advantage of this change."

Prognosis\n**Mortality and Morbidity**\nDeath from opioid overdose is on the rise. One study found that deaths from opioid-only overdose increased by 384% between 1999 and 2018. Polysubstance overdose deaths increased by 760% over the same period in adolescents and young adults. According to the CDC, nearly 108,000 individuals succumbed to opioid overdose in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic response also led to an increase in mortality, as it limited access to treatment services.\nThe primary cause of morbidity and mortality following an opiate overdose is respiratory arrest. Seizures, acute lung injury, and adverse cardiac events may also occur but are less common. Individuals with preexisting lung pathology who overdose on opiates face a significantly higher risk of respiratory distress and death compared to the general population. Another factor contributing to opiate toxicity is the presence of coingestants, with the eventual toxicity depending on the type of substance involved. A Canadian study found that the risk of fatal opiate toxicity doubled when opiates were taken with gabapentin, which is also known to depress respiration. Additionally, morbidity and mortality are influenced by the intent behind the opiate ingestion. Individuals attempting suicide often consume multiple drugs simultaneously, substantially increasing the risk of death.\n**Prognosis**\nIf the patient does arrest in the setting of a pure opiate overdose, the cause in most cases is severe hypotension, hypoxia, and poor brain perfusion. The outcome for these individuals is poor."

The outcome for these individuals is poor. Complications\nOpiate toxicity can also produce complications beyond the typical respiratory and CNS adverse effects. The most common ones are discussed in this section. **Acute Lung Injury**\nAcute lung injury is a well-known complication of heroin overdose. However, this condition may also occur after overdoses involving methadone and propoxyphene and is almost universally observed in patients who succumb to high doses of opiates. The exact mechanism by which opiates cause lung injury remains unclear, but the outcome is hypoventilation and hypoxia caused by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Clinically, heroin-induced lung injury presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, frothy sputum production, cyanosis, tachypnea, and rales\u2014symptoms consistent with pulmonary edema. Acute lung injury has also been reported in children who ingest high doses of opiates. The presentation is very similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most cases resolve with aggressive airway management and oxygen therapy, including positive pressure ventilation. Standard medications for pulmonary edema are typically avoided, as diuretics may worsen hypotension. **Infection**\nComplications of intravenous opioid use include abscesses, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Gram-positive bacteria, such as _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus,_ are the most common organisms involved. If these bacteria enter the systemic circulation, the risk of additional complications like epidural abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis increases. These conditions often present with symptoms such as fever and persistent back pain. Some individuals who inject drugs directly into the neck risk developing jugular vein thrombophlebitis, Horner syndrome, and pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery. Both peripheral and pulmonary emboli have been reported in people who inject opioids. Accidental injection into nerves may also cause permanent neuropathy."

Both peripheral and pulmonary emboli have been reported in people who inject opioids. Accidental injection into nerves may also cause permanent neuropathy. Endocarditis is a serious complication of intravenous drug use, often resulting from injecting illicit drug mixtures with contaminated needles. Diagnosing infectious endocarditis can be challenging due to the initially vague symptoms. While right-sided heart valves are most commonly affected, left-sided valves may also be involved in some cases. The tricuspid valve is the valve most frequently affected in individuals who use intravenous drugs. Endocarditis often presents with fever, malaise, and a new murmur. In some patients, recurrent septic pulmonary embolism may be the only presenting feature. The organism most commonly involved in right-sided endocarditis is _Staphylococcus aureus_. In contrast, left-sided endocarditis may be polymicrobial, involving organisms such as _Streptococcus_ , _E. coli_ , _Pseudomonas_ , and _Klebsiella_. Symptoms and signs tend to be more pronounced in left-sided endocarditis compared to right-sided cases. Other infectious manifestations of opioid abuse include recurrent pneumonia, with aspiration pneumonia occurring in some unconscious individuals. Necrotizing fasciitis, another life-threatening complication, often presents with severe pain, fever, and dark, dusky skin with crepitus. The individual may show signs of septic shock. Aggressive resuscitation and immediate surgical debridement can be life-saving. **Musculoskeletal and Neurologic Sequelae**\nRhabdomyolysis is a relatively common complication of opioid overdose that may occur even without compartment syndrome. Opioids are likewise known to increase the risk of seizures, particularly drugs like propoxyphene, meperidine, pentazocine, intravenous fentanyl, and heroin. The individual may present with a prolonged seizure, which may result from CNS hypoperfusion and hypoxia or from intracranial injury due to a fall. **Narcotic Bowel Syndrome**\nNarcotic bowel syndrome is a type of opiate-induced bowel pathology characterized by frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe abdominal pain that worsens with escalating or continued opiate doses. This syndrome typically occurs in individuals without prior bowel pathology and represents a maladaptive response. Narcotic bowel syndrome may also be associated with intermittent vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation. Eating tends to aggravate the symptoms, which can last for days or weeks."

Narcotic bowel syndrome may also be associated with intermittent vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation. Eating tends to aggravate the symptoms, which can last for days or weeks. Anorexia may result in weight loss, and delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit are delayed. The syndrome is often mistaken for bowel obstruction. The key to diagnosis lies in recognizing that continued and escalating opiate doses worsen abdominal pain rather than provide relief. Treatment for narcotic bowel syndrome involves psychotherapy, as well as tapering or discontinuing the opioid. Successful treatment depends on developing a strong patient-physician relationship and trust, gradually withdrawing the narcotic, and using nonpharmacological treatments to manage pain. **Withdrawal Reaction**\nWithdrawal symptoms following cessation of opiates are common, but they are often vague and less severe than those observed with alcohol or benzodiazepine discontinuation. The onset of symptoms depends on the drug ingested, typically occurring within 2 to 4 days after methadone cessation and 8 to 10 hours after meperidine withdrawal. Autonomic symptoms may include excessive lacrimation, sweating, piloerection, rhinorrhea, repeated yawning, myalgia, nasal congestion, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms usually peak between 36 and 48 hours and gradually subside within 72 hours. Symptoms may last 7 to 14 days in chronic drug addicts. Treatment for withdrawal symptoms is supportive, and the use of additional opiates to counter withdrawal symptoms is not recommended. Clonidine may be used in severe withdrawal cases, especially when methadone is inappropriate or unavailable. After acute treatment, the patient should be referred to a long-term drug rehabilitation program to help prevent relapse."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nWith the drastic increase in opioid abuse and overdose-related deaths, much attention has focused on this so-called \"opioid epidemic.\" All healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners who prescribe controlled substances, have a role in reducing the opioid epidemic and should be equipped to identify and treat those experiencing toxicity and overdose.\nNew research focuses on finding effective interventions and identifying risk factors for overdose. Some of these efforts include treatment programs, take-home intranasal naloxone, and monitored injection facilities. A review of research exploring overdose education and naloxone distribution suggests reduced fatality rates for patients who receive counseling and prescriptions for home naloxone.\nNaloxone has been shown to have a very safe side effect profile. Several studies on opiate-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, acute opioid withdrawal symptoms may develop when this agent is administered to opioid-tolerant patients. Individuals given naloxone in the setting of opioid overdose may experience sudden withdrawal syndrome, manifesting as aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting also occur in about 30% of patients. Most symptoms are not severe or sustained, and less than 1% of patients require admission. Acute withdrawal symptoms are more likely with larger doses of naloxone. Despite the risk of precipitated withdrawal, naloxone should not be withheld in cases of acute opioid overdose with respiratory depression.\nAn interprofessional approach should involve physicians, nurses, and substance abuse counselors. The goal of the collaborative efforts of this group is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with OUD."

Introduction\nMDMA, or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, is a synthetic amphetamine derivative known as a recreational drug since the 1980s by street names such as \"Ecstacy,\" \"E,\" \"Molly,\" \"XTC,\" \"X,\" \"Beans,\" and \"Adams.\" The entactogenic properties foster euphoria, memory retrieval, and enhanced sensory perception. The synthetic derivative of amphetamine was first developed in 1912, leading to public introduction in the 1960s and recreational drug use in the 1980s.\nMDMA is widely considered part of the psychoactive group of substances called entactogens (Greek roots meaning \"touching within\"). As an entactogen, MDMA promotes euphoria, retrieval of repressed memories, feelings of closeness, empathy, sexuality, and communication. Under the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed MDMA in Schedule I in 1985, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. However, a recent landmark double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial found that MDMA may be highly effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combination with psychotherapy. As a result, the use of MDMA for PTSD treatment is in the process of FDA approval.\nMDMA is mainly available in colorful tablets with logo brands but may also be in capsule, powder, and liquid forms. Its use mainly involves swallowing tablets, but sometimes, it may be crushed and insufflated. Its effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hepatic systems can be life-threatening, and recognizing its toxicity is essential for clinicians in emergency settings."

Its effects on the cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hepatic systems can be life-threatening, and recognizing its toxicity is essential for clinicians in emergency settings. Etiology\nThe potential for MDMA toxicity exists with each ingestion, substantiating its designation as a Schedule I drug. MDMA is commonly ingested in tablet form; however, the tablet may be crushed and ingested intranasally. Recreational doses of MDMA can vary significantly from 50 mg to 200 mg per tablet. However, analysis of compounds sold as ecstasy or molly has revealed mixed composition with other substances, including methyl diethanolamine (MDEA, also known as \"eve\"), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA, also known as \"sally\"), ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol, inactive substitutes, some producing hemodynamic effects. As a result, significant adverse effects and toxicity can occur with one-time or first-time ingestion due to the unknown dosage and composition of the drug.\nMDMA is commonly used with other recreational drugs, which can potentiate or antagonize the toxic effects on the neurological and cardiovascular systems. Combined with physical activity in a hot, humid environment, this compounding effect can lead to significant hyperthermia, dehydration, and hyponatremia, mimicking the effects of heat stroke in many cases."

Epidemiology\nTrends in MDMA use are well documented throughout the years, with user age ranging from the 8th grade to the collegiate level and adulthood. A review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s and early 2000s. For example, lifetime MDMA use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 and 1990, while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 and 1999. From 1999 to 2000, lifetime use among 8th graders increased from 2.7% to 4.3%, while this increase was significantly greater in 12th graders (8%-11%). Also, emergency room visits in the United States increased from 253 to 4511 between 1994 and 2000. A 2002 Monitoring the Future study found that 12.7% of United States college students had used ecstasy once in their lifetime. The 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health found a greater than 200% increase in MDMA use by adults 18 to 25 years old from 1996 to 2002. While the number of users increased significantly from the early 1990s and 2000s, the number of new users varied from 2002 to 2007. Surveys found a decrease in users from 1.2 million in 2002 to 642,000 in 2003, then up to 860,000 from 2006 to 2007. In 2011, data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated about 14.5 million users aged 12 or older had used MDMA at least once in their lifetime, with approximately 900,000 using it for the first time in 2011."

Pathophysiology\nThe difference between MDMA and other amphetamines is due to the attachment of the methylenedioxy group, which is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogen mescaline. MDMA is a compound with characteristics of both amphetamines and hallucinogens. It primarily increases the concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin within the synaptic cleft. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and stimulates its carrier-mediated release into synapses. Like other amphetamine analogs, MDMA also inhibits monoamine oxidase activity, which further contributes to increased serotonin levels (in addition to dopamine and norepinephrine). Like serotonin, MDMA affects dopamine transporters by promoting release and inhibiting reuptake. The binding of noradrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors contributes to the noradrenaline, histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine effects of the drug. The activity on post-synaptic receptors plays a role in mood, thermoregulation, and the autonomic nervous system.\nThe desired effects of the drug include sympathomimetic arousal, sensual enhancement, feelings of euphoria, and emotional closeness to others. Other effects include nausea, trismus, and bruxism. These effects are attributable to the increased circulation of dopamine and serotonin. Blood pressure and heart rate elevations are secondary to the adrenergic effects of increased circulating norepinephrine acting on \u03b1, \u03b2-1, and \u03b2-2 receptors.\nIn addition to its effects on neurotransmitters, MDMA increases the levels of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), leading to fluid retention. This effect, coupled with excessive water intake, is implicated in the development of life-threatening hyponatremia and coma."

History and Physical\nThe presentation of acute MDMA toxicity is similar to amphetamines and includes tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. However, MDMA has less stimulant and more serotonergic effects compared to amphetamines and methamphetamines. At low doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity, such as bruxism, restless legs, jaw clenching, hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness.\nSignificant life-threatening complications include serotonin syndrome, cardiac dysrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages. Since MDMA undergoes metabolism via hepatic CYP2D6, severe hepatoxicity may occur, leading to fulminant liver failure. Central nervous system (CNS) hyperactivity can lead to agitated delirium and seizures.\nBecause MDMA is a popular rave drug, the combination of intense physical activity with the sympathomimetic effects of the drug leads to an increase in body temperature that resembles heat stroke and could result in rhabdomyolysis. Significant increases in fluid consumption by users coupled with the development of the syndrome of inappropriate diuretic syndrome (SIADH) may potentially contribute to the development of severe hyponatremia, leading to cerebral edema, seizures, and death."

Evaluation\nDiagnostic testing should be guided by the clinical presentation (history and physical exam). Initially, evaluation of the altered patient must include intravenous (IV) access, vital signs, rapid glucose check, and complete physical examination. Obtaining a core body temperature (rectal or bladder) is critical to diagnose life-threatening hyperthermia (>105 \u00b0F or >40.5 \u00b0C).\nRecommended lab tests are as follows:\n1. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) to evaluate for:\n- Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia\n- Acute kidney injury - blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels\n- Rhabdomyolysis - creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels\n1. Liver function tests (LFTs) to evaluate fulminant hepatic failure\n1. Electrocardiogram (EKG) for screening tachyarrhythmias\n1. Complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, coagulation profile, chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) head scan, or lumbar puncture in the undifferentiated altered mental status patient\n1. Qualitative urine immunoassays (urine drug screens) for amphetamines should not guide the clinical management of patients. The major limitation of amphetamine immunoassays is the high rate of false positives and false negatives.

They should be discontinued as soon as possible to avoid the development or worsening of rhabdomyolysis and heat generation. A core temperature (rectally or bladder) greater than 105 \u00b0F (40.5 \u00b0C) represents rapid life-threatening hyperthermia and takes precedence after initial airway evaluation. Treatment of hyperthermia involves both rapid sedation to control agitation and external cooling. External cooling with whole-body ice-water immersion is effective for treating life-threatening hyperthermia.\nSedation with IV benzodiazepines such as diazepam (10 mg) or lorazepam (2 mg) is the first-line treatment for agitation secondary to acute amphetamine toxicity. The predictable pharmacokinetics, high therapeutic index, and anti-epileptic activity of benzodiazepines make for an effective treatment for undifferentiated agitated patients. If IV access is unavailable, intramuscular doses of midazolam are effective. Sedation should be titrated rapidly until the patient is calm.\nRhabdomyolysis from acute amphetamine toxicity occurs from psychomotor agitation and hyperthermia. Supportive care with IV hydration should maintain a urine output of at least 1 to 2 mL/kg/h. Urine acidification may increase elimination and decrease the half-life of amphetamines. Still, it is not recommended since it does not decrease toxicity and increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) from rhabdomyolysis. Hemodialysis may be required in patients with renal failure, severe acidemia, and hyperkalemia. Given the limited evidence and potential harms, dantrolene is not recommended to treat amphetamine-induced hyperthermia."

Prognosis\nThe 2 most frequently reported causes of death include hyperthermia and hyponatremia. While toxicity can be severe, a literature review reveals deaths related to MDMA toxicity are rare. Confounding factors include co-ingested drugs, making it challenging to determine if MDMA was the cause of death.\nThough deaths are rare, animal and radiological studies have demonstrated the potential for long-term adverse effects. In MDMA-treated monkeys, a loss of serotonin axon terminal markers was observed, leading to deficits in emotion, memory, and high-order cognitive processes. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans in baboons showed significant decreases in radioactivity levels in various brain areas. Similarly, human volunteers with a history of MDMA use underwent PET scanning and were found to have a global dose-related reduction in a structural element of serotonin. Further studies on PET scans of volunteers with a history of MDMA abuse showed similar effects, along with changes in the amygdala and neocortex regions. Deficits in short-term memory, visual memory, verbal memory, and reasoning seem to be associated. The cerebrovascular systems may also be affected, causing a decline in cognitive abilities that can resemble dementia."
