This condition primarily impacts the bronchial tree, leading to irritation, inflammation, and increased mucus production. Viral infections, such as the common cold or influenza viruses, adenovirus, and rhinovirus, are frequent instigators, although exposure to irritants or other respiratory pathogens can also be putative triggers. These viruses are transmitted through respiratory droplets and induce inflammation and irritation within the bronchial tree, ultimately leading to the characteristic symptoms of acute bronchitis, which encompass coughing, sputum production, and respiratory discomfort. Bacterial pathogens play a role in approximately 10% or less of acute bronchitis instances. Among these bacterial pathogens, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ , and _Bordetella pertussis_ are the most commonly identified offenders. In contrast, the majority, approximately 90% to 95%, of cases in healthy adults are attributed to viral infections. Additional factors, including allergens, irritants, and occasionally bacterial pathogens, can also incite acute bronchitis. A higher prevalence of influenza viruses A and B are seen in the winter months, escalating transmission and infection rates. These viruses exhibit ease in spreading within crowded indoor settings like schools, workplaces, and public gatherings, where close interpersonal contact facilitates their transmission through respiratory droplets. Influenza viruses' efficiency in infecting and replicating within the respiratory tract allows for rapid viral multiplication, culminating in significant damage to the bronchiolar epithelial cells. This damage, coupled with the body's immune response, contributes to the distinctive symptoms of acute bronchitis. While viral infections are more prevalent during the winter season, acute bronchitis can arise at any time of the year, often linked to strains of adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus."

Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of viral infections causing acute bronchitis throughout the year is essential for healthcare providers and public health officials in implementing effective prevention and control strategies, especially in the context of evolving respiratory viruses and changing environmental factors. Examples of this are as follows:\n- Influenza, RSV, and human coronaviruses typically exhibit peak incidence during winter. As stated previously, this seasonal pattern arises as people tend to spend more time indoors and engage in close interpersonal contact, creating an environment conducive to the rapid transmission of these viruses. - Rhinoviruses typically experience peaks in incidence during the spring and fall seasons, coinciding with shifts in weather patterns.

History and Physical\nPatients affected with acute bronchitis typically exhibit a range of symptoms, including a productive cough, feelings of malaise, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. Often, the most prominent complaint is the persistent cough, with an accompanying clear or yellowish sputum production. However, on occasion, the sputum can take on a purulent appearance.

In the early stages of infection, the symptoms of mild upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis can often overlap, creating a challenge in distinguishing between both based solely on symptoms. Both conditions may present with common respiratory symptoms such as:\n- Cough: Initially, the cough may start as dry and irritating, but as acute bronchitis advances, it can transition to producing sputum. In acute bronchitis, this cough tends to persist for longer, often extending beyond 5 days. Approximately 50% of patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum. Prolonged or forceful coughing may lead to chest wall or substernal musculoskeletal pain, usually self-limiting. - Mild fever: A low-grade fever may be present in both conditions, although it is more frequently associated with upper respiratory infections. The presence of high-grade fevers in the setting of acute bronchitis is unusual and warrants further diagnostic evaluation."

It is important to note that similar signs of tachycardia can also be observed in bacterial infections. In general, the evaluation of the rest of the body systems typically falls within normal limits. Evaluation\nAcute bronchitis is typically diagnosed clinically, relying on a comprehensive assessment encompassing a medical history, pulmonary examination, and other pertinent physical findings. The evaluation of oxygen saturation, along with the assessment of pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate, serves as a pivotal indicator for gauging the severity of the condition. In cases where vital signs fall within normal ranges and no physical examination findings suggest pneumonia, further diagnostic investigations are generally unnecessary. However, an exception to this rule applies to older patients (>75 years) or individuals with neurocognitive impairment. In such instances, a more extensive workup should be considered part of the evaluation process. Chest x-ray (CXR) findings in cases of acute bronchitis are generally nonspecific and often appear normal. The CXR findings may occasionally reveal increased interstitial markings indicative of bronchial wall thickening. A CXR proves particularly valuable in distinguishing pneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are present. Evidence-based guidelines established by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR where specific criteria are met, including the following:\n- Heart rate exceeding 100 bpm\n- Respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min\n- Oral body temperature surpassing 38 \u00b0C\n- Chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus\nLaboratory testing, including a complete blood count and chemistry panel, may be conducted as part of the diagnostic workup for fever. The white blood count might show a mild elevation in some cases of acute bronchitis. Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach."

Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach. Some of these circumstances include:\n- Influenza season: During the influenza season, rapid testing for influenza may be recommended in specific patient populations. This population includes individuals at a heightened risk of complications, such as older individuals, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. Healthcare workers who develop respiratory symptoms may also benefit from rapid testing to determine the presence of influenza and assess the appropriateness of the antiviral treatment. - Viral pandemics: In the context of viral pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid testing becomes essential for diagnosing and managing the infection. Swift identification of cases is imperative for promptly implementing appropriate infection control measures, timely administration of treatment, and prevention of further viral transmission. - High suspicion of pertussis or bacterial infections: When a strong clinical suspicion of pertussis (whooping cough) or other bacterial respiratory infections arises, rapid testing proves valuable in confirming the diagnosis. Such testing can serve as a guide for initiating antibiotic treatment, thereby aiding in the containment of further transmission. Multiplex polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates is a diagnostic tool that allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single test. This method helps diagnose infections attributed to specific bacteria, such as _B_ _pertussis_ (the causative agent of whooping cough), _M_ _pneumoniae_ , or _C_ _pneumonia_. The advantage of multiplex PCR testing lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify the presence of these bacterial pathogens in respiratory samples, facilitating the differentiation of various causes of respiratory infections. By detecting the target bacteria's genetic material (DNA or RNA), PCR testing provides a sensitive and specific diagnosis, especially when compared to traditional culture methods, which may have sensitivity and turnaround time limitations. However, it remains essential to ensure this testing approach is adequately validated and employed within a comprehensive clinical assessment context."

However, it remains essential to ensure this testing approach is adequately validated and employed within a comprehensive clinical assessment context. Treatment / Management\nAcute bronchitis is typically a self-limiting condition, and its treatment primarily revolves around providing symptomatic and supportive therapy. For alleviating cough, both nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches can be considered. Nonpharmacological strategies include remedies such as hot tea, honey, ginger, and throat lozenges. Notably, the efficacy of these interventions has not been evaluated through clinical trials. In clinical practice, antitussive agents like dextromethorphan (with or without codeine) are often used to suppress cough based on their effectiveness in managing chronic bronchitis symptoms and data from studies on cough associated with the common cold. No randomized trials specifically assess the efficacy in antitussive agents in acute bronchitis. Codeine usage should be avoided due to its addictive potential. The available data regarding the use of mucolytic agents in acute bronchitis treatment are conflicting and lack a clear consensus on efficacy. Therefore, these agents' role in managing acute bronchitis remains a subject of ongoing investigation and debate. Beta-agonists are commonly administered to patients with acute bronchitis who exhibit wheezing. However, the findings from small randomized control trials investigating the use of beta-agonists for cough in acute bronchitis have yielded mixed results. In a Cochrane review encompassing 5 trials, no substantial benefit of beta-agonists on daily cough was observed, except for a minor advantage in a subgroup of patients with wheezing and airflow obstruction at baseline. A more recent Cochrane review reported similar outcomes. Analgesic and antipyretic agents may manage associated symptoms like malaise, myalgia, and fever. Additionally, prednisone or other steroids may be administered to address inflammation."

Additionally, prednisone or other steroids may be administered to address inflammation. While the evidence supporting their benefit in acute bronchitis is limited, they can be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Typically, steroids are utilized as a short-term burst therapy. In certain cases, an extended tapering course of steroids may be warranted, especially for patients with underlying asthma or COPD. ACCP guidelines recommend against antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis among otherwise healthy adults. A comprehensive Cochrane review of 9 randomized, controlled trials of antibiotic agents found only a minor reduction in the total duration of cough (0.6 days) with no significant decrease in the overall duration of illness. Consequently, antibiotic use should be avoided in uncomplicated cases of acute bronchitis, considering factors such as the cost of antibiotics, the increasing global concern of antibiotic resistance, and the potential side effects associated with antibiotic usage. Numerous other international medical societies also advise against antibiotic use in cases of viral acute bronchitis. Despite these recommendations, many patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis are prescribed antibiotics. It is important to emphasize that no empirical data justify the belief that antibiotic therapy leads to less severe or shorter duration of cough in acute bronchitis. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended only when a treatable pathogen is identified, as with pertussis (see **Table. ** Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis).

Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis.\n- The use of oseltamivir and zanamivir has been shown to offer minor benefits in reducing the duration of influenza symptoms by an average of half a day in adults. These medications are also effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic influenza when used as a prophylactic measure. However, limited evidence supports the claim that these drugs can reduce the risk of hospital admission or pneumonia. Furthermore, a Cochrane review suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing the person-to-person spread of influenza. The complications associated with influenza, such as pneumonia, cannot be reduced by treatment trials due to the lack of clear diagnostic definitions. The use of oseltamivir has been found to increase the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects, and renal events in adults. Therefore, the balance between the benefits and harms of using neuraminidase inhibitors for prophylaxis or treatment should be carefully considered when making decisions.\nIn summary, robust data are lacking supporting the use of beta-agonists, steroids, neuraminidase inhibitors, and mucolytic agents, particularly in patients without underlying COPD and asthma. Treatment decisions should be based on the individual's response to these interventions and the reported benefits while carefully considering the balance between potential risks and benefits in each case."

Pearls and Other Issues\nAcute bronchitis is a very common respiratory symptom that affects the bronchial tree. The majority (90%) of cases are caused by viruses, resulting in inflammation and increased mucus production. Occasionally, secondary pneumonia can develop, typically characterized by worsening symptoms, a productive cough, and fever. In such cases, a CXR is advisable, particularly for adults in an immunocompromised state, older individuals, infants, newborns, and individuals who smoke.\nIdentifying the pathogen responsible for acute bronchitis is helpful, although not always necessary. In recent years, new technological developments have made this possible, such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs that can identify more than one organism at once.\nAcute bronchitis is usually a self-limiting condition and rarely requires treatment. Acute bronchitis caused by specific types of pathogens can be treated with antiviral therapies in addition to symptomatic and supportive therapies.\nEnsuring pulmonary emboli are on the list of differentials for patients with cough and shortness of breath is prudent. Aggressive coughing can result in spontaneous pneumothorax or spontaneous pneumomediastinum, underscoring the importance of a CXR when acute symptom deterioration occurs."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nIn managing acute bronchitis, an interprofessional healthcare team comprising physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals is critical in delivering patient-centered care, improving outcomes, ensuring patient safety, and optimizing team performance. To achieve these goals, the team must employ various skills and strategies, uphold ethical standards, embrace shared responsibilities, foster open interprofessional communication, and coordinate care effectively. Here are key components for enhancing healthcare team outcomes in acute bronchitis management:\n- **Skills and Expertise** : Each team member should possess the clinical skills and expertise relevant to their role in acute bronchitis care. Physicians should be proficient in diagnosis and treatment options, nurses should excel in patient monitoring and education, and pharmacists should be well-versed in medication management and potential drug interactions. - **Evidence-Based Practice** : The team should consistently apply evidence-based guidelines and current best practices in diagnosing and managing acute bronchitis. Staying current with the latest research and recommendations is crucial for delivering high-quality care. - **Responsibilities and Roles** : Clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the team are essential. Physicians diagnose and prescribe treatment, nurses provide patient education and monitor progress, pharmacists ensure safe medication use, and other professionals contribute their specialized knowledge. - **Care Coordination** : Coordinating care is central to optimizing patient outcomes. This involves scheduling follow-up appointments, ensuring adherence to treatment plans, and actively involving patients in their care decisions. - **Patient Education** : Nurses are vital in educating patients about their condition, treatment options, and preventive measures. Empowering patients with knowledge encourages active participation in their care and contributes to improved outcomes."

Pneumonia should be considered a potential diagnosis when detecting rales or egophony. Mild tachycardia may accompany these findings, indicating fever and dehydration secondary to the viral illness. It is important to note that similar signs of tachycardia can also be observed in bacterial infections. In general, the evaluation of the rest of the body systems typically falls within normal limits."

It is important to note that similar signs of tachycardia can also be observed in bacterial infections. In general, the evaluation of the rest of the body systems typically falls within normal limits. Evaluation\nAcute bronchitis is typically diagnosed clinically, relying on a comprehensive assessment encompassing a medical history, pulmonary examination, and other pertinent physical findings. The evaluation of oxygen saturation, along with the assessment of pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate, serves as a pivotal indicator for gauging the severity of the condition. In cases where vital signs fall within normal ranges and no physical examination findings suggest pneumonia, further diagnostic investigations are generally unnecessary. However, an exception to this rule applies to older patients (>75 years) or individuals with neurocognitive impairment. In such instances, a more extensive workup should be considered part of the evaluation process. Chest x-ray (CXR) findings in cases of acute bronchitis are generally nonspecific and often appear normal. The CXR findings may occasionally reveal increased interstitial markings indicative of bronchial wall thickening. A CXR proves particularly valuable in distinguishing pneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are present. Evidence-based guidelines established by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR where specific criteria are met, including the following:\n- Heart rate exceeding 100 bpm\n- Respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min\n- Oral body temperature surpassing 38 \u00b0C\n- Chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus\nLaboratory testing, including a complete blood count and chemistry panel, may be conducted as part of the diagnostic workup for fever. The white blood count might show a mild elevation in some cases of acute bronchitis. Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach."

Rapid microbiological testing for respiratory infections may not always be cost-effective or essential in every situation. Nevertheless, specific scenarios exist in which testing can be beneficial and potentially result in alterations to the treatment approach. Some of these circumstances include:\n- Influenza season: During the influenza season, rapid testing for influenza may be recommended in specific patient populations. This population includes individuals at a heightened risk of complications, such as older individuals, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. Healthcare workers who develop respiratory symptoms may also benefit from rapid testing to determine the presence of influenza and assess the appropriateness of the antiviral treatment. - Viral pandemics: In the context of viral pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid testing becomes essential for diagnosing and managing the infection. Swift identification of cases is imperative for promptly implementing appropriate infection control measures, timely administration of treatment, and prevention of further viral transmission. - High suspicion of pertussis or bacterial infections: When a strong clinical suspicion of pertussis (whooping cough) or other bacterial respiratory infections arises, rapid testing proves valuable in confirming the diagnosis. Such testing can serve as a guide for initiating antibiotic treatment, thereby aiding in the containment of further transmission. Multiplex polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates is a diagnostic tool that allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single test. This method helps diagnose infections attributed to specific bacteria, such as _B_ _pertussis_ (the causative agent of whooping cough), _M_ _pneumoniae_ , or _C_ _pneumonia_. The advantage of multiplex PCR testing lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify the presence of these bacterial pathogens in respiratory samples, facilitating the differentiation of various causes of respiratory infections. By detecting the target bacteria's genetic material (DNA or RNA), PCR testing provides a sensitive and specific diagnosis, especially when compared to traditional culture methods, which may have sensitivity and turnaround time limitations. However, it remains essential to ensure this testing approach is adequately validated and employed within a comprehensive clinical assessment context."

However, it remains essential to ensure this testing approach is adequately validated and employed within a comprehensive clinical assessment context. Treatment / Management\nAcute bronchitis is typically a self-limiting condition, and its treatment primarily revolves around providing symptomatic and supportive therapy. For alleviating cough, both nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches can be considered. Nonpharmacological strategies include remedies such as hot tea, honey, ginger, and throat lozenges. Notably, the efficacy of these interventions has not been evaluated through clinical trials. In clinical practice, antitussive agents like dextromethorphan (with or without codeine) are often used to suppress cough based on their effectiveness in managing chronic bronchitis symptoms and data from studies on cough associated with the common cold. No randomized trials specifically assess the efficacy in antitussive agents in acute bronchitis. Codeine usage should be avoided due to its addictive potential. The available data regarding the use of mucolytic agents in acute bronchitis treatment are conflicting and lack a clear consensus on efficacy. Therefore, these agents' role in managing acute bronchitis remains a subject of ongoing investigation and debate. Beta-agonists are commonly administered to patients with acute bronchitis who exhibit wheezing. However, the findings from small randomized control trials investigating the use of beta-agonists for cough in acute bronchitis have yielded mixed results. In a Cochrane review encompassing 5 trials, no substantial benefit of beta-agonists on daily cough was observed, except for a minor advantage in a subgroup of patients with wheezing and airflow obstruction at baseline. A more recent Cochrane review reported similar outcomes. Analgesic and antipyretic agents may manage associated symptoms like malaise, myalgia, and fever. Additionally, prednisone or other steroids may be administered to address inflammation."

Additionally, prednisone or other steroids may be administered to address inflammation. While the evidence supporting their benefit in acute bronchitis is limited, they can be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Typically, steroids are utilized as a short-term burst therapy. In certain cases, an extended tapering course of steroids may be warranted, especially for patients with underlying asthma or COPD. ACCP guidelines recommend against antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis among otherwise healthy adults. A comprehensive Cochrane review of 9 randomized, controlled trials of antibiotic agents found only a minor reduction in the total duration of cough (0.6 days) with no significant decrease in the overall duration of illness. Consequently, antibiotic use should be avoided in uncomplicated cases of acute bronchitis, considering factors such as the cost of antibiotics, the increasing global concern of antibiotic resistance, and the potential side effects associated with antibiotic usage. Numerous other international medical societies also advise against antibiotic use in cases of viral acute bronchitis. Despite these recommendations, many patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis are prescribed antibiotics. It is important to emphasize that no empirical data justify the belief that antibiotic therapy leads to less severe or shorter duration of cough in acute bronchitis. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended only when a treatable pathogen is identified, as with pertussis (see **Table. ** Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis). Antiviral treatment should be considered for influenza infection. ! [Table Icon](/books/NBK448067/table/article-18645.table0/?report=objectonly \"Table\")"

Pathogens and Treatments Related to Acute Bronchitis.\n- The use of oseltamivir and zanamivir has been shown to offer minor benefits in reducing the duration of influenza symptoms by an average of half a day in adults. These medications are also effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic influenza when used as a prophylactic measure. However, limited evidence supports the claim that these drugs can reduce the risk of hospital admission or pneumonia. Furthermore, a Cochrane review suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing the person-to-person spread of influenza. The complications associated with influenza, such as pneumonia, cannot be reduced by treatment trials due to the lack of clear diagnostic definitions. The use of oseltamivir has been found to increase the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects, and renal events in adults. Therefore, the balance between the benefits and harms of using neuraminidase inhibitors for prophylaxis or treatment should be carefully considered when making decisions.\nIn summary, robust data are lacking supporting the use of beta-agonists, steroids, neuraminidase inhibitors, and mucolytic agents, particularly in patients without underlying COPD and asthma. Treatment decisions should be based on the individual's response to these interventions and the reported benefits while carefully considering the balance between potential risks and benefits in each case."

Pearls and Other Issues\nAcute bronchitis is a very common respiratory symptom that affects the bronchial tree. The majority (90%) of cases are caused by viruses, resulting in inflammation and increased mucus production. Occasionally, secondary pneumonia can develop, typically characterized by worsening symptoms, a productive cough, and fever. In such cases, a CXR is advisable, particularly for adults in an immunocompromised state, older individuals, infants, newborns, and individuals who smoke.\nIdentifying the pathogen responsible for acute bronchitis is helpful, although not always necessary. In recent years, new technological developments have made this possible, such as multiplex polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs that can identify more than one organism at once.\nAcute bronchitis is usually a self-limiting condition and rarely requires treatment. Acute bronchitis caused by specific types of pathogens can be treated with antiviral therapies in addition to symptomatic and supportive therapies.\nEnsuring pulmonary emboli are on the list of differentials for patients with cough and shortness of breath is prudent. Aggressive coughing can result in spontaneous pneumothorax or spontaneous pneumomediastinum, underscoring the importance of a CXR when acute symptom deterioration occurs."
