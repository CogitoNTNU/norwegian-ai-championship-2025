    "text": "Evaluation\nThe evaluation of any trauma patient begins with evaluating the airway, accessing the breathing, and managing the circulation. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury following blunt trauma depends primarily on the hemodynamic status of the patient. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, a CT scan is the ideal test for solid organ injury in the abdomen and pelvis. For unstable patients, one may perform an ultrasound (Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (EFAST)) or diagnostic peritoneal lavage, both of which are associated with a high rate of false negatives and false positives. All indications for trauma ultrasound include blunt or penetrating trauma to the torso where there is a suspicion of intraperitoneal hemorrhage, pericardial tamponade, and hemothorax. The Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma(EFAST) exam includes the following views:\n1\\. **RUQ (right upper quadrant)**\n- One should evaluate for free fluid in Morison's pouch or the hepatorenal space, the lower pole of the kidney, and the space below the diaphragm on the right. In the supine patient, the hepatorenal space is the most dependent area and the least obstructed for fluid flow. Fluid in the abdomen can move freely to the right pericolic gutter into this space. 2\\. **Perisplenic space LUQ (left upper quadrant)**\n- One should visualize the diaphragm and the entire spleen\n- Check above the diaphragm for signs of free fluid in the left hemithorax. On the left, fluid flows preferentially into the subphrenic area and not into the splenorenal area, which is important because the subphrenic area may be difficult to visualize due to bowel gas and splenic flexure gas. 3\\. **Pelvis (bladder)**\n- Visualize the interface w/ the rectum, prostate, or uterus. - Additionally, a second image can be viewed in a longitudinal plane."

See below\n5 _._ Normal Lung: Lung sliding back and forth is normally secondary to the normal anatomy of the parietal and visceral pleural movement. Also, the pleura moves with respect to the ribs and comet tail artifacts. Pneumothorax: With a pneumothorax, there is no lung sliding back and forth. One will note the pleura and ribs move together. There will be NO comet tail artifacts. **CARDIAC**\n**Subxiphoid four-chamber**\nBoth the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized for anterior or posterior fluid in the pericardium. - Parasternal views should be attempted if the subxiphoid view is not adequate. - Both the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized. **Parasternal long axis (PSLA)**\n- Both the anterior and posterior pericardium should be visualized. - In the ideal plane, the mitral and aortic valves will be visible, as well as a long view of the left ventricle. **Parasternal short axis (PSSA)**\n- The left ventricle will appear as a ring, with the right ventricle more anterior. **Apical Four-chamber**\n- Though rarely useful in the emergency department, this view allows easy comparison of left and right ventricles. - All four chambers should be visible in this plan."

Treatment / Management\nTreatment of patients with blunt abdominal injury requires the routine ABCs (Airway, Breathing, and Circulation). Once the airway is protected, it is mandatory to protect the cervical spine. After the primary survey is complete, patients who are hypotensive require aggressive fluid resuscitation. If hemodynamic instability persists, blood should be typed and crossed, but in the meantime, immediate transfusion with O negative blood can be done (O+ for males and women past childbearing years). All patients with blunt abdominal trauma who have signs of peritonitis, frank bleeding, or worsening of clinical signs require an immediate laparotomy. Non-surgical treatment in patients with blunt abdominal injury depends on the clinical features, hemodynamic stability, and results of the CT scan. Advances in angiography can now help control hemorrhage with the use of embolization therapy, which is more cost-effective than laparotomy. In general, the prognosis of patients with blunt abdominal trauma is good."

In general, the prognosis of patients with blunt abdominal trauma is good. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nBlunt abdominal trauma results in thousands of admissions each year, resulting in great costs to the healthcare system. While the actual injury is managed by a team of healthcare professionals, there is also a focus on preventing such injuries. The nurses not only are responsible for monitoring these patients but they also have an important role in patient education. To prevent blunt abdominal trauma, the public has to be educated on wearing a safety belt. These safety devices have to be worn even if the motor vehicle comes fitted with airbags. More importantly, the public must be educated about defensive driving and maintaining a safe distance from other automobiles on the road. Plus, the public should be told about the consequences of drinking and driving. Finally, the nurse and the pharmacist should educate the public on avoiding distractions in the car, like eating, texting, or using a mobile phone.\n**Outcomes**\nIn the past two decades, the outcomes of blunt abdominal trauma have improved. However, there are very few papers published on long-term data, and hence, the eventual outcome of these patients remains unknown. For patients with minor blunt trauma, the outcomes are good, but for those who suffer multiple organ injuries, the in-hospital mortality can vary from 3% to 10%. The ready availability of CT scans has also allowed physicians to closely monitor these patients without performing unnecessary surgeries."

    "text": "Etiology\nPenetrating trauma due to gunshot results from a firearm and can lead to multisystem organ injury, shock, and infection. A projectile from a firearm will enter the skin and layers of tissue and inflict damage to anything in its pathway. This may include soft tissue structures only but may also include damage to bone, vasculature, and internal organs. A penetrating gunshot abdominal injury can result in the foreign object remaining in soft tissue compartments or finding an exit pathway out of the body. If the projectile enters the body, it is considered a penetrating injury. If there is an exit wound that accompanies the entry wound, this may be considered a perforating abdominal wound. Many abdominal gunshot wounds result in penetrating trauma.\nA mainstay of care for a potentially penetrating gunshot wound to the abdomen is emergency evaluation and often emergency surgical consultation is required to rule out acute abdomen, prevent exsanguination, and decrease the likelihood of developing peritonitis and sepsis.\nIn addition to the physical exam, an emergency assessment may include a FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) to rule out hemoperitoneum. Health care professionals may choose to order X-rays and other rapid imaging to quickly identify the location of the foreign object or bullet and plan early goal-directed management. In an emergency setting, many patients with abdominal gunshot wounds may be taken immediately to surgery for diagnostic evaluation and treatment of injuries."

Epidemiology\nFirearm-related deaths are the third leading cause of trauma-related deaths in the United States today. In an average week, 645 people lose their lives to firearm violence and 1565 more are treated in an emergency department for a firearm-related injury. Firearm homicide is the second leading cause of injury death among youth 10 to 24 years of age. Firearm suicide is the third leading cause of injury death for persons aged 35 years and older, after drug overdoses and motor vehicle crashes. Overall, firearm injuries are ranked among the 5 leading causes of death for people ages 1 to 64 in the United States. In a study completed from 2010 to 2012, almost half of all firearm deaths in the United States occurred in the South and were lowest in the Northeast region. Internationally, war-inflicted countries have increased the incidence of gunshot abdominal injury due to more firearms being available.\nRacial disparities in firearm-related homicide and suicide do exist. The homicide rate is 7 fold higher in Black males than any other demographic. Also, it is notable that non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan natives account for the majority of suicides related to firearms. Young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 years have the highest rate of fatal firearm injury and approximately 90% of patients are males. The male age group of 20\u201324 years old is notably the most affected by firearm injury. Males disproportionately bear the burden of firearm mortality, accounting for 86% of all victims of firearm death."

Males disproportionately bear the burden of firearm mortality, accounting for 86% of all victims of firearm death. History and Physical\nThe history of a penetrating abdominal trauma during the initial presentation of the patient to the emergency department is crucial to providing clues to the pattern of injury. Taking a detailed and thorough history of the patient may guide potential management. Personnel such as paramedics, police officers, or fire rescue who may have arrived at the scene of the injury may be utilized as sources of essential history regarding the etiology of the injury. This is especially important if the patient has altered mental status and is unable to relay the history of the incident. It is beneficial to gather information regarding the events surrounding the injury, including the environment, people involved, allergies, medications, and past medical history of the patient. Information about the caliber of the weapon, the number of shots heard, and any other extenuating circumstances may provide additional valuable information. Additionally, efforts should be made to ensure provider safety by hospital security and law enforcement until the circumstances of the injury are fully understood.\nPhysical exam following the ABCs of trauma is essential. Because the presentation is often not straightforward, the exact diagnosis can be difficult. Besides pain, the patient may present with bleeding per rectum, unstable vital signs, and the presence of peritonitis. The physical exam may reveal wounds, ecchymosis, abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds, and tenderness to palpation. If peritonitis is present, abdominal rigidity, guarding, and rebound tenderness may be present. Early and serial monitoring of vital signs can be helpful to determine shock either at presentation or developing during the evaluation. A comprehensive external exam looking for wounds is an essential part of the evaluation of a patient with an abdominal gunshot wound."

A comprehensive external exam looking for wounds is an essential part of the evaluation of a patient with an abdominal gunshot wound. Evaluation\nThe evaluation of any trauma patient begins with evaluating the airway, accessing the breathing, and managing the circulation. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury following penetrating trauma depends primarily on the initial presentation and hemodynamic status of the patient. If hemodynamic stability can be established, in the absence of peritonitis, a computed technography (CT) scan is a feasible option. This scan is able to detect intraperitoneal free fluid, solid organ damage, and active serosanguinous extravasation if present. If the patient is potentially hemodynamically unstable and rapidly deteriorating, the ideal initial radiologic assessment is the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (EFAST). This EFAST exam is a point of care ultrasound for critically ill patients. It is a comprehensive tool that specifically targets the detection of hemorrhage in the spaces of the abdomen. With experience, trained health care professionals learn to quickly assess and identify pathologic states in pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities of the body. Indications for an EFAST ultrasound include blunt or penetrating trauma to the torso where there is a suspicion of intraperitoneal hemorrhage, pericardial tamponade, and hemothorax. **Components of the extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (EFAST) ultrasound**\n1\\. Right upper quadrant (RUQ) - when evaluating this region, the evaluator must consider that if the hemorrhage is present within the peritoneum, is most commonly found within the RUQ. The anatomical structures found within a right upper quadrant include:\n- Inferior pole of the right kidney\n- Subphrenic space (between diaphragm and liver)\n- Hepatorenal space (between liver and kidney, also known as Morrison's pouch)\n- Pleural space\n2\\."

Treatment / Management\nTreatment of patients with abdominal gunshot injury begins with the initial contact of personnel who arrive at the scene of injury, such as paramedics. In penetrating abdominal injury due to a gunshot wound, initial treatment can be paramount for the prognosis and survival of the victim. The most important task for the initial assessment is to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation of the patient and stop the bleeding. Once a clear airway is established, the cervical spine must be protected if indicated by the mechanism of injury. Assessment of breath sounds is essential as the location of the wound on the abdomen does not rule out injuries to structures outside of the abdomen. Efforts to obtain hemostasis before arriving at the emergency room may entail pressure on the wound. Depending on materials available, gauze, shirts, towels, and any other fabrics can be applied with pressure to aid in coagulation. A tourniquet may be utilized if a professional can apply to the area affected, but this is less likely with abdominal gunshot wounds than extremity wounds. If, when assessing vital signs, the patient is no longer breathing or loses pulses, the protocol of CPR should be initiated immediately. For patients with hemodynamic instability, aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated, and blood should be typed and screened. O negative blood should be made ready for an emergency transfusion, with it being the lower risk of causing serious adverse transfusion reactions. Massive transfusion protocol, where available, may be initiated in the hemodynamically unstable patient."

Massive transfusion protocol, where available, may be initiated in the hemodynamically unstable patient. Prognosis\nThe prognostic success of early goal-directed management of abdominal gunshot wounds is of most importance. Still, it is mainly based on the severity and extent of the injury and the time of presentation to the hospital. The usual management of abdominal gunshot wounds involves supportive measures such as hemostasis techniques, blood transfusions, cardiopulmonary support, and surgical attention to injured intraperitoneal structures damaged structures and an attempt to remove foreign objects. Timely surgical intervention may influence mortality and morbidity. Unfortunately, the mortality from abdominal gunshot wounds remains very high. The reason is that the severity of the gunshot wound may vary due to bullet caliber, the trajectory of the object in the body cavity, and energy transfer into the destruction of the penetrating structures.\nA study was published on trauma patients in Philadelphia who experienced penetrating trauma due to penetrating stab wound or gunshot wounds to analyze mortality rates between 2003 and 2007 of patients entering the Philadelphia hospitals. This study reports that of the 4,122 patients taken to eight Level I and Level II adult trauma centers, 2,961 were transported by EMS and 1,161 by the police, and carried an overall mortality rate was 27.4 percent. In this study, about 77.9% of these victims endured gunshot wounds, and about 22.1% endured wounds due to stabbing. Approximately one-third of patients with gunshot wounds expired, and approximately 7.7% died of complications due to stab wounds."
