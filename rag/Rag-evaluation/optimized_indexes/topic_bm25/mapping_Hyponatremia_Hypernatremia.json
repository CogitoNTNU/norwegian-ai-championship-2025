    "text": "Pathophysiology\nEAH stems from both increased consumption of hypotonic fluids and inappropriate water retention. Before and throughout strenuous physical activity, athletes often over hydrate with hypotonic fluids (water, sports drinks). When intake exceeds that of water lost via urine, sweat, and insensible respiratory and gastrointestinal losses (often greater than 1.5 liters), athletes may retain free water, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia. The contribution of sodium loss from excessive sweat is controversial and not well characterized, as sweat loss varies greatly between individual athletes.\nIt is postulated that stimuli related to physical exertion may result in sympathetic activation of the hypothalamus, which stimulates ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary inappropriately during low osmolar states. These stimuli include pain, emotional stress, nausea, emesis, hypoglycemia, heat exposure, and medication use (particularly NSAIDs). Elevated ADH leads to stimulation of renal V2 receptors, causing water reabsorption rather than excretion. The retained free water is returned to the extracellular fluid resulting in a net lowering of serum sodium concentration.\nSubsequent hyponatremia results in an osmotic gradient that favors free water movement from the vascular space to the extravascular and intracellular spaces, leading to tissue edema (particularly brain and lung), which drives the most severe symptoms of EAH."

History and Physical\nPrompt identification and differentiation from other common exertional injuries are essential to caring for an athlete with EAH. Healthcare providers should suspect EAH when athletes present during or within 24 hours following intense physical exertion, such as marathon running, cycling, triathlon, hiking, backpacking, or prolonged military field training or combat operations. The likelihood of EAH is increased if the exertional event occurred over a period greater than 2 hours or in hot weather.\nPresenting symptoms range from asymptomatic, to mild, to severe. Mild symptoms include lightheadedness, malaise, fatigue, irritability, generalized weakness, headache, nausea, and sluggish urine output. Severe symptoms include vomiting, oliguria or anuria, altered mental status, collapse, seizure, coma, and death during sport or soon after.\nDiagnosis of EAH is further supported by the absence of signs of symptomatic heat illness or dehydration, such as thirst, postural dizziness, dry mucous membranes, orthostatic hypotension, and elevated core temperature. Differentiating EAH from exercise heat illness and dehydration is critical, as isotonic fluid administration that would be given for the empiric treatment of either heat illness or dehydration could be life-threatening if the true diagnosis is EAH.\nOn physical examination, patients with mild EAH may demonstrate mild hyperthermia, tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, and lethargy. Patients with severe EAH may demonstrate altered sensorium ranging from inattentiveness to complete obtundation, loss of sweating, hypotension, and abnormal limb movements."

Patients with severe EAH may demonstrate altered sensorium ranging from inattentiveness to complete obtundation, loss of sweating, hypotension, and abnormal limb movements. Evaluation\nInitial evaluation of suspected EAH includes vital signs, determination of mental status via the Glasgow coma scale, and assessment of airway patency, adequate respiration, and intact circulation. Accurate core temperature is key and should be taken rectally if possible to differentiate from heat illness. Exertional heat illness such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion can occur concurrently with EAH, given the similarities in precipitating events and risk factors.\nThe serum sodium should be determined if point-of-care (POC) serum sodium testing is available (though this is not often practical due to cost and limited functional temperature range of POC testing devices). A history supporting excessive hypotonic fluid intake and prolonged exertion should be taken if the patient can participate in an interview or a coach, teammate, partner, or another witness is available. A serum sodium level of less than 135 mmol/L with accompanying excessive fluid intake history is diagnostic for EAH. The serum glucose should also be determined if POC glucose testing is available, as hypoglycemia can present similarly."

The serum glucose should also be determined if POC glucose testing is available, as hypoglycemia can present similarly. Treatment / Management\n**Prehospital**\nPrior to treatment, EAH must be correctly differentiated from other exertional illnesses such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST), as their treatments are often contradictory. Treatment is dictated by the presence or absence of neurologic symptoms. The goal of treatment is the correction of serum sodium and improvement in symptoms. If a patient does not demonstrate neurologic symptoms, EAH is considered mild, and the patient is eligible for oral fluid restriction. Patients restrict their total fluid intake to induce osmotic ADH suppression and, therefore, free water excretion. Patients may also be given concentrated oral sodium repletion, though this may be poorly tolerated due to taste or nausea and vomiting. Proposed regimens include 100 ml of hypertonic saline, 3 or 4 broth bouillon cubes in 125 ml of water, or a serving of salted pretzels. Oral hypertonic saline is as effective as IV hypertonic saline in mild EAH. One study demonstrated faster time to recovery and shorter duration of hospital stay for athletes who receive oral treatment. IV isotonic fluids of any type or volume are not recommended in mild EAH. EAH is considered severe if a patient demonstrates neurologic symptoms (altered mental status, seizure, coma). The patient should receive a bolus of 100 ml of IV hypertonic saline. This can be repeated every 10 minutes for a total of 3 doses. Up to 600-1000 ml over 1 hour of hypertonic saline has been given without complication in case studies, though larger volumes of sodium repletion increase the risk for rapid sodium correction and osmotic demyelination."

Complications\nThe major complications of EAH and its treatment include exercise-associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE), noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, central pontine myelinolysis, and improper treatment resulting from an alternate diagnosis.\nIf left untreated, mild EAH can progress to severe EAH with profoundly altered mental status, seizure, and coma\u2014an end-stage finding due to cerebral edema termed EAHE. EAHE is often fatal, though the exact mortality rate is not defined. The treatment for EAHE is a prompt correction of serum sodium with hypertonic saline and supportive care for its sequelae (respiratory support, seizure management).\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary edema may also develop secondary to osmotic dysregulation in EAH, leading to respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support.\nRapid correction of hyponatremia may result in central pontine demyelination, a catastrophic and permanent demyelinating event that presents with neurologic deficits despite correction of the serum sodium.\nIf EAH is diagnosed mistakenly in the presence of true dehydration or heat stroke, treatment with hypertonic fluids, fluid restriction, and lack of cooling may cause further harm to the patient."

Deterrence and Patient Education\nEAH can be prevented by avoiding overhydration, ensuring adequate oral sodium intake, and educating athletes, event staff, and healthcare providers on the prevention strategies and presenting symptoms.\nEAH occurs when hypotonic fluid intake exceeds total body fluid losses. Therefore the safest strategy for fluid repletion is a thirst-driven replacement to avoid overhydration. Estimates of individual athlete replacement needs by monitoring weight changes during training activities may also be used, though this may not be practical. Forced hydration, particularly at large volumes, should be discouraged.\nSalty foods may be consumed in conjunction with oral fluids as desired by the athlete to support osmotic balance during endurance events. Supplementing the serum sodium with salt tablets or packets at any particular rate or total dose during activity has not been shown to decrease rates of EAH.\nAthletes participating in organized endurance events should be educated on the risks of overhydration, the importance of concurrent food intake, and the signs and symptoms of EAH and other heat injuries. Event staff, EMS and frontline healthcare providers, and military members should also be educated on recognizing EAH in the field and prevention measures via avoiding overhydration and adequate oral intake."

    "text": "Etiology\nThe basic mechanisms of hypernatremia are water deficit and excess solute. Total body water loss relative to solute loss is the most common reason for developing hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is usually associated with hypovolemia, which can occur in conditions that cause combined water and solute loss, where water loss is greater than sodium loss or free water loss. Combined loss can be seen in extra-renal conditions such as gastroenteritis, vomiting, prolonged nasogastric drainage, burns, and excessive sweating. Excessive sweating can occur due to exercise, fever, or high heat exposure. Renal losses can be seen in intrinsic renal disease, post-obstructive diuresis, and with the use of osmotic or loop diuretics. Hyperglycemia and mannitol are common causes of osmotic diuresis. Free water loss is seen with central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) and also in conditions with increased insensible loss. Central DI can occur due to inadequate production of ADH. Common causes of central DI are idiopathic, head trauma, cranial neoplasm, and pituitary infiltrative diseases, such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis. Nephrogenic DI occurs due to tubular unresponsiveness to the action of ADH and can be inherited in an X-linked pattern or secondary to certain medications, including lithium, foscarnet, and demeclocycline. Rarely, hypernatremia with inadequate fluid intake can be seen in breastfed babies, child or elder abuse, and patients with an impaired thirst response. Excess sodium usually is iatrogenic and seen in the hospital setting but can be associated with improper formula mixing, excess sodium bicarbonate ingestion, salt tablet poisoning, hyperaldosteronism, and seawater drowning."

History and Physical\nMost patients present with symptoms suggestive of fluid loss and clinical signs of dehydration. Symptoms and signs of hypernatremia are secondary to central nervous system dysfunction and are seen when serum sodium rises rapidly or is greater than 160 meq/L. Infants and Children present with irritability and agitation, which can progress to lethargy, somnolence, and coma. Other symptoms include increased thirst response in alert patients and high-pitched cries in infants. Patients with diabetes insipidus present with polyuria and polydipsia. The skin can feel doughy or velvety due to intracellular water loss. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are usually present in hypovolemic hypernatremia. The patient may have increased tone with brisk reflexes and myoclonus. It is important to remember that the degree of dehydration can be underestimated in children with hypernatremia due to a shift of water from the intracellular space to the extravascular space. Polyuria is one of the common symptoms of diabetes insipidus."

Polyuria is one of the common symptoms of diabetes insipidus. Treatment / Management\nProper management of hypernatremia involves identifying the underlying condition and correcting the hypertonicity. The goal of therapy is to correct both the serum sodium and the intravascular volume. Fluids should be administered orally or via a feeding tube whenever possible. In patients with severe dehydration or shock, the initial step is fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids before free water correction. Hypernatremia is corrected by calculating the free water deficit using one of the following formulas. - Total Body Water[0.6 in men and 0.5 in women x body weight(kg)] x [(plasma sodium/140) -1]\n- 4ml x bodyweight x (desired change in serum sodium meq/L)\nIt is important to remember that rapid correction of hypernatremia can lead to cerebral edema because water moves from the serum into the brain cells. The goal is to decrease serum sodium by not more than 12 meq in 24 hours. Close serial monitoring of serum sodium every 2 to 4 hours is essential during the acute phase of correction. Seizures occurring during the correction of hypernatremia are a sign of cerebral edema due to rapid shifts in osmolality, and the administration of hypotonic fluids should be halted. The estimated free water deficit should be corrected over 48 to 72 hours with a decrease in serum sodium not exceeding 0.5 meq per hour. Patients should be carefully monitored for the rate of correction, urine output, and ongoing losses. In cases of sodium intoxication, the free water requirement may be too large and cause volume overload, requiring the use of loop diuretics and, at times, peritoneal dialysis to remove excess sodium."

The key is to identify the cause and correct the hypertonicity. The goal of therapy is to correct both the serum sodium and the intravascular volume.

Frequent communication between the attending physician, the nursing staff, and the pharmacist is crucial to avoid the rapid correction of sodium levels. Rapid correction of sodium levels can lead to a seizure, cerebral edema, or permanent neurological deficit. Special attention should be given to high-risk nursing home patients with neurological or physical impairments who are prone to develop recurrent hypernatremia. Discharge care coordination among discharging physicians, primary care physicians, and nursing home staff can prevent readmission due to hypernatremia. Serum sodium and drug levels should be periodically monitored in patients who are taking medications known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
