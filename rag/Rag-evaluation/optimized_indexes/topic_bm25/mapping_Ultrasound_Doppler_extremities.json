    "text": "Introduction\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is on the rise in the United States due to our aging population and the persistence of risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.\nAs patients present with suspected PAD, it is critical to obtain a full history and physical exam. Based on clinical findings, some patients may warrant diagnostic studies to further localize and quantify the severity of the disease. Non-invasive studies are a valuable adjunct for PAD assessment, particularly for lower extremity arterial disease.\nThe following article will discuss arterial Doppler, plethysmography, and pulse-volume recording (PVR). Given the safety, ease, and relative rapidity of the following exams, these assessments establish a baseline measurement trend over time. Based on these noninvasive findings, clinicians can pursue further studies and invasive procedures.\nThe ankle-brachial index (ABI) and arterial duplex imaging are also typical non-invasive tests to evaluate vascular disease, which have been described in previous articles.\nWhile there can be variability between healthcare systems, it is common practice at our institution to order bilateral arterial doppler imaging with ABI's with Photoplethysmography (PPG) and segmental toe pressures with PVR for the initial evaluation of a patient with clinical findings suspicious for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. These diagnostic studies are not required for all patients with vascular disease. Still, they should be considered in patients with reasonable suspicion of undiagnosed arterial disease or patients with progression of a known disease."

Still, they should be considered in patients with reasonable suspicion of undiagnosed arterial disease or patients with progression of a known disease. Procedures\nContinuous-wave Doppler: It applies the Doppler effect to moving blood red blood cells to assess flow velocity within a vessel. The Doppler probe is coupled to the skin with gel and angled to the direction of blood flow. Sound waves are emitted from and reflected back to the probe. These sound waves return with a different frequency based on blood flow. The changes in frequency are converted to an audible flow signal.\nPlethysmography: It measures the volume change within a vessel via light, known as photoplethysmography (PPG). Infrared light is emitted from and reflected back to the probe. The blood volume affects how much light is reflected, which produces a waveform that is recorded and plotted on a graph. This modality is typically performed under normal conditions and then again after inflation of an occlusive cuff.\nPulse volume recording (PVR): A form of plethysmography used to measure arterial flow qualitatively indirectly. To obtain a PVR, a cuff is inflated to about 65mmHg and then attached to a plethysmograph. With each pulse, the blood volume affects the pressure of the cuff, which is then recorded as an arterial contour.\nPVR is also used to detect reactive hyperemia or the response in blood flow following a period of ischemia.\nDuring this study, an occlusive cuff is placed above the ankle for up to 5 minutes and then rapidly deflated. PVR is monitored distally once the cuff is taken down."

Indications\nWhile there are no strict indications, non-invasive lower extremity studies are typically ordered for evaluation of arterial disease who present with the following:\n- Claudication: Effort followed by discomfort that improves with rest; pain that improves when legs are held to gravity, i.e., off the side of the bed\n- Ischemic rest pain\n- Nonhealing lower extremity wound\nFor patients with advanced diabetes, symptoms can include:\n- Leg fatigue\n- Recurrent stenosis/occlusion of tibial vessels\n- Peripheral neuropathy\nOf note, if a patient has undergone previous lower extremity bypass surgery or arterial stenting, there is limited utility for ABI's with PVR and toe pressures, as artificial grafts and stents have different compressibility in comparison to native vasculature. These patients are typically evaluated initially with arterial Duplex or computed tomography angiography to image their bypass graft/intravascular stent to assess patency and velocities.\nContinuous-wave Doppler can also be used in a variety of settings to assess blood flow. During pregnancy, continuous-wave doppler is used to assess fetal heart rate prenatally as well as during labor.\nUltrasound is frequently used to evaluate heart and valve function, as well as assess vascular access in patients on dialysis and renal artery stenosis.\nFor the critically ill, continuous-wave doppler can be used in a transcranial fashion as an adjunct to document brain deterioration."

For the critically ill, continuous-wave doppler can be used in a transcranial fashion as an adjunct to document brain deterioration. Normal and Critical Findings\n**Continuous-wave Doppler**\nThe result from continuous wave doppler is a sound, which corresponds to the velocity of blood flow within a vessel. A typical peripheral artery at rest will have a triphasic or biphasic quality of sound, which corresponds to forward flow in systole, a brief reversal of flow in early diastole, then forward flow in late diastole. With worsening arterial disease, flow is dampened, as is the resultant signal. In a diseased vessel, triphasic or biphasic signals give way to a monophasic pattern with a lower amplitude. Of note, in low resistance vessels, such as the carotid artery, there is no reversal of flow; the resulting signal is monophasic, corresponding to constant forward flow. **Plethysmography**\nPlethysmography results in a waveform that measures the variation of blood volume. The typical peripheral artery waveform will have a steep upslope, well-defined systolic peak, a dicrotic notch, and bowing downslope to return to baseline. The waveform is dampened within the diseased vessel, with widened upslope and loss of the dicrotic notch. **Pulse volume recording**\nA PVR is also a waveform that typically accompanies a segmental pressure taken at different levels of the bilateral lower extremities. Distal waveforms generally decrease in amplitude. An abrupt change in waveform morphology and/or amplitude indicates some level of stenosis proximal to the measurement. These changes are typically dose-dependent: the severity of waveform alteration correlates with the intra-arterial disease severity. Patients with peripheral arterial disease will compensate for their reduced flow with baseline arterial dilation. Patients with significant disease will be maximally dilated and have a limited response to reactive hyperemia or temporary occlusion."

Obesity is associated with a hypercoagulability status via two mechanisms, 1. increased fibrinogen levels that may even surpass twofold the normal value, and 2. slower venous circulation flow in the infra diaphragmatic and especially in the lower limbs. Both factors, associated with disorders in several coagulation factors, favor the appearance of venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolic events, and mostly fatal pulmonary thromboembolisms (PE), which are the primary cause of mortality in obese patients. Potential risk factors of deep vein thrombosis might be categorized according to the transient, persistent, or unprovoked criteria. Accordingly, transient risk factors are as follows: 1. surgery with general anesthetics, 2. hospitalization, 3. Cesarean section, 4. hormone replacement therapy, 5. pregnancy and peripartum period, 6. lower extremity injury with limited mobility for more than 72 hours. It should be noted that general anesthesia for longer than 30 minutes and hospitalization for longer than 72 hours are considered the transient risk factors of DVT."

Epidemiology\nIncidence and prevalence: Deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli are common and often \"silent\" and thus go undiagnosed or are only picked up at autopsy. Therefore, the incidence and prevalence are often underestimated. It is thought the annual incidence of DVT is 80 cases per 100,000, with a prevalence of lower limb DVT of 1 case per 1000 population. Annually in the United States, more than 200,000 people develop venous thrombosis; of those, 50,000 cases are complicated by pulmonary embolism.\n- Age: Deep-vein thrombosis is rare in children, and the risk increases with age, most occurring in the over-40 age group.\n- Gender: There is no consensus about whether there is a sex bias in the incidence of DVT.\n- Ethnicity: There is evidence from the United States that there is an increased incidence of DVT and an increased risk of complications in African Americans and white people compared to Hispanic and Asian populations.\n- Associated diseases: In the hospital, the most commonly associated conditions are malignancy, congestive heart failure, obstructive airway disease, and patients undergoing surgery."

History and Physical\nThe clinical presentation of acute lower extremity DVT varies with the anatomic distribution, extent, and degree of occlusion of the thrombus. Symptoms may range from absence to massive swelling and cyanosis with impending venous gangrene. Three patterns of thrombosis are usually recognized: isolated calf vein (distal), femoropopliteal, and iliofemoral thrombosis, and symptoms tend to be more severe as thrombosis extends more proximally (see **Video. ** Popliteal Deep Vein Thrombosis With Partial Color Flow, Video). However, up to 50% of patients with acute DVT may lack specific signs or symptoms. Postoperative patients are, in particular, more likely to have small, asymptomatic, distal, non-occlusive thrombi. When present, signs and symptoms of acute lower extremity DVT may include pain, edema, erythema, tenderness, fever, prominent superficial veins, pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot (Homan\u2019s sign), and peripheral cyanosis. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens, characterized by the triad of massive swelling, cyanosis, and pain, is the most severe form of acute lower extremity DVT and results from complete thrombosis of an extremity\u2019s venous outflow.\\[7\\] In advanced cases, it is marked by severe venous hypertension with collateral and microvascular thrombosis, leading to venous gangrene. Venous gangrene is particularly associated with warfarin-mediated protein C depletion in patients with cancer or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Obtaining the diagnosis of DVT only based on clinical signs and symptoms is notoriously inaccurate. The signs and symptoms of DVT are generally non-specific. They may be associated and misdiagnosed with other lower extremity disorders. Accordingly, lymphedema, superficial venous thrombosis, and cellulitis should be excluded. However, the most common presenting symptoms with inconsistent sensitivity and specificity are calf pain and swelling."

Evaluation\nThe following veins are categorized as deep veins according to the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification: 1. inferior vena cava, 2. common iliac, 3. internal and external iliac, 4. pelvic veins, including a. gonadal, and b. broad ligament veins, 5. common femoral, 6. deep femoral vein, 7. femoral, 8. popliteal, 9. paired crural veins of anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal, 10. muscular veins of gastrocnemial, and soleal. As per the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines following investigations are done:\n- D-dimers (very sensitive but not very specific)\n- Coagulation profile\n- Proximal leg vein ultrasound, which, when positive, indicates that the patient should be treated as having a DVT\nDeciding how to investigate is determined by the risk of DVT. The first step is to assess the clinical probability of a DVT using the Wells scoring system. - The clinical probability is low for patients with a score of 0 to 1, but for those with two or above, the clinical probability is high. - If a patient scores 2 or above, either a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be done within 4 hours, and if the result is negative, a D-dimer test should be done. If imaging is not possible within 4 hours, a D-dimer test should be undertaken, and an interim 24-hour dose of a parenteral anticoagulant should be given. A proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 24 hours of being requested. - In the case of a positive D-dimer test and a negative proximal leg vein ultrasound scan, the proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be repeated 6 to 8 days later for all patients."

Clinical decision rules such as the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) and the Wells Criteria should be employed with the patient presenting with a possible DVT. Risk stratification is crucial in deciding diagnostic and management options. Patients who meet PERC criteria may need no further testing, whereas those who do not meet PERC criteria and are low probability based on the Wells criteria may be candidates for rule-out with a D-dimer. The D-dimer test is sensitive but not specific and should be used selectively in a low-probability patient who does not have other confounding diagnoses that could produce a false positive test.

This point-of-care ultrasound exam should be used with other clinical decision rules and is perhaps most useful in those patients with high and low pre-test probability. With the patient supine in the frog-leg position, apply approximately 20 to 30 degrees of reverse Trendelenburg to increase venous distention. Place the high-frequency linear transducer (5 to 10 MHz) in the transverse plane at the anatomical location of the inguinal ligament. Just distal to the inguinal ligament, the common femoral vein can be visualized. Apply direct pressure to the vein. The complete collapse of the vein indicates there is no presence of a DVT. Continue distally along the femoral vein to where the greater saphenous vein and deep femoral vein deviate from the common femoral vein. Complete compression of all venous structures at these levels rules out a proximal DVT. Next, proceed to the popliteal region. Laterally rotate the leg, flex the knee, and place the high-frequency transducer transversely in the popliteal fossa. The popliteal vein typically resides just anterior to the popliteal artery. Apply a compressive force once again and observe for complete compression. Compress the areas just proximal and distal to the popliteal fossa as well to complete the two-region technique. If DVT studies are negative, repeat testing may be required in one to two weeks to rule out a propagating calf DVT further. Alternatively, sending a D-dimer test may be adequate in certain patient populations. Typical laboratory tests also should be sent to evaluate for coagulation status, blood count, and renal function.

The cornerstone of treatment is anticoagulation. NICE guidelines only recommend treating proximal DVT (not distal) and those with pulmonary emboli. In each patient, the risks of anticoagulation need to be weighed against the benefits. Treatment for DVT should be addressed mainly according to the underlying causality of DVT as follows:\n- The preferred anticoagulant to address DVT in cancer-associated thromboembolism is low molecular weight heparin and factor Xa inhibitors, including rivaroxaban. However, in the following circumstances, the higher levels of anticoagulation should be considered: 1. recently diagnosed cancer, 2. extensive VTE circumstances, and 3. cancer treatment-related adverse effects, including vomiting. - In circumstances where once-daily oral therapy is the preferred management, the following options are viable; 1. rivaroxaban, 2. edoxaban, and 3. vitamin-K antagonist (VKA)\n- In the context of liver disease, DVT should be managed with low-molecular-weight heparin. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated in raised INR levels. - In patients with renal disease suppressed creatinine clearance to less than 30 ml/min, VKAs are recommended. DOACs and LMWH should be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease. - In patients with a remarkable past medical history of coronary artery disease, the following alternatives are recommended: 1. VKA, 2. rivaroxaban, 3. apixaban, and 4. edoxaban. - In patients with remarkable dyspepsia or any past medical history suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding, VKA, and apixaban are the preferred treatments."

However, it should be noted that some patients might still be highly compliant with other alternatives, including DOACs. - If thrombolytic therapy is indicated, unfractionated heparin is indicated. - In patients who might later be subjected to reversal of thrombolytic therapy, it should be noted that reversal agents for DOACs are not universally available. - Since most anticoagulants have the potential to cross the placenta, the preferred anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy is LMWH. Moreover, the following guidelines address the required duration of treatment. - Prescribe low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux for 5 days or until the international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than 2 for 24 hours (unfractionated heparin for patients with renal failure and increased risk of bleeding). - Supplement with vitamin K antagonists for 3 months. - In patients with cancer, consider anticoagulation for 6 months with low-molecular-weight heparin. - In patients with unprovoked DVT, consider vitamin K antagonists beyond 3 months. - Rivaroxaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor that has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and NICE and is attractive because there is no need for regular INR monitoring. - If the platelet count drops to less than 75,000, switch from heparin to fondaparinux, which is not associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombolysis: The indications for the use of thrombolytics include:\n- Symptomatic iliofemoral DVT\n- Symptoms of less than 14 days duration\n- Good functional status\n- A life expectancy of 1 year or more\n- Low risk of bleeding\nThe use of thrombolytic therapy can result in an intracranial bleed, and hence, careful patient selection is vital."

It should be noted that the results from network meta-analysis indicate that NOACs are an effective treatment for thromboprophylaxis of VTE or VTE-related mortality) in the extended treatment scenarios. However, the complication with bleeding risk differs. Accordingly, apixaban was reported to have the most favorable profile. The comparison was published in the context of other NOACs, warfarin with endpoints of INR 2.0 to 3.0, and aspirin.\nIn the mechanical prophylactic arm, the following measures should be evaluated;\n- Graduated compression stockings\n- Intermittent pneumatic compression devices\n- Venous foot pumps\n- Electrical stimulation devices\nStill, mechanical devices should be applied in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nDeep-vein thromboses can occur in many settings and almost every medical specialty; failing to diagnose DVT can result in a pulmonary embolus, which can be fatal. DVTs also result in more prolonged admission to the hospital and drug treatment that can last 3 to 9 months, all of which add to the cost of healthcare. Thus its diagnosis and management are best made with an interprofessional healthcare team consisting of clinicians, specialists, nurses, physical therapists, vascular technicians, and pharmacists. The focus is on the prevention of DVT. In addition to clinicians, both nurses and pharmacists are vital in educating patients about DVT prophylaxis. Nurses are the first professionals to encounter patients being admitted to the hospital, and it is here that the prevention of DVT starts. Nurses must educate the patients on the importance of ambulation, complying with compression stockings, and taking the prescribed anticoagulation medications. In both the operating room and post-surgery, nurses play a key role in reminding physicians of the need for DVT prophylaxis. Each hospital has guidelines on DVT prophylaxis and treatment, and all healthcare workers should follow them. Once a DVT has developed, the pharmacist should be familiar with the current anticoagulants and their indications. They can consult with the prescribing/ordering clinician and perform medication reconciliation. Plus, the pharmacist must educate the patients on the need for treatment compliance and the need to undergo regular testing to ensure that the INR is therapeutic. Once DVT is diagnosed, the treatment is with an anticoagulant for 3 to 6 months, and again, monitoring of the INR by a hematology nurse or pharmacist is necessary. Further, these patients need to be monitored for bleeding."
