    "text": "History and Physical\nThe history and physical examination alone may not always diagnose AMI definitively. The history should focus on the onset, quality, and associated symptoms. Recent studies suggest that diaphoresis and bilateral arm radiating pain are more commonly associated with MI in men. Other associated symptoms may include the following:\n- Lightheadedness\n- Anxiety\n- Cough\n- Choking sensation\n- Diaphoresis\n- Wheezing\n- Irregular heart rate\nThe physical examination should include the patient\u2019s vital signs and appearance, including diaphoresis, pulmonary evaluation, and cardiac auscultation. Specific vital aspects of the examination are as follows:\n- **Heart rate:** Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular arrhythmia may be present, indicating cardiac electrical disturbances.\n- **Pulses:** Unequal pulses may be observed if the patient has an aortic dissection, indicating a potential arterial problem.\n- **Blood pressure:** Blood pressure is typically high in AMI but may become hypotensive if the patient is in shock due to compromised cardiac function.\n- **Respiratory findings:** Tachypnea and fever may be present, indicating an inflammatory response.\n- **Neck veins:** Distended neck veins may be observed, suggesting right ventricular failure and increased central venous pressure.\n- **Cardiac findings:** The heart may exhibit lateral displacement of the apical impulse, a soft S1 sound, a palpable S4 sound, and a new mitral regurgitation murmur. A loud holosystolic murmur radiating to the sternum may indicate ventricular septal rupture.\n- **Pulmonary findings:** Wheezing and rales may be heard if the patient has developed pulmonary edema, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n- **Extremities:** Edema or cyanosis may be present in the extremities, with a sensation of coldness due to compromised circulation."

Evaluation\nEarly and prompt ECG testing should be employed in all patients presenting with chest pain. Women may experience atypical symptoms such as abdominal pain or dizziness and may present without chest pain (see **Image. ** Myocardial Infarction Warning Signs in Women). Older patients often present with shortness of breath rather than chest pain in cases of MI. All of the aforementioned presentations should prompt ECG testing. The ECG is a highly specific diagnostic tool for MI, with a specificity of 95% to 97%. However, its sensitivity is relatively low, at approximately 30%. Right-sided, posterior lead placement and repeat ECG testing can increase ECG sensitivity. For example, peaked T-waves on ECG, known as \"hyperacute T waves,\" often indicate early ischemia and will progress to ST elevation. When present, ST-elevation findings greater than 2 mm in 2 contiguous leads on ECG (inferior: leads II, III, aVF; septal: equal V1, V2; anterior: V3, V4; lateral: I, aVL, V5, V6) are indicative of a STEMI (see **Image. ** ECG With Pardee Waves Indicating AMI). Often, ST depressions are visualized in opposite anatomical regions of the myocardium. Diagnosing STEMI using the ECG can be challenging, particularly in patients with a left bundle branch block and pacemakers. However, specific criteria have been identified to aid in the diagnosis. Sgarbossa criteria suggest isolated ST elevations in lead aVR can indicate left main coronary artery occlusion in the appropriate clinical setting. Wellens criteria noted deeply biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3, often predictive of an impending proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, potentially leading to devastating anterior wall myocardial infarction. Patients presenting with symptoms of MI may not exhibit diagnostic ST-elevation ECG abnormalities."

Patients presenting with symptoms of MI may not exhibit diagnostic ST-elevation ECG abnormalities. In cases in which patients have typical chest pain but no obvious ST elevation, further investigation for NSTEMI is warranted. Subtle abnormalities on ECG, such as ST depressions and T-wave changes, may be present. Serial ECGs can be helpful in looking for dynamic changes. ECG findings without acute changes or any abnormalities are common in NSTEMI. Diagnostic guidelines can aid practitioners in determining whether additional testing helps identify patients with NSTEMI. Considering the limited sensitivity of ECG in STEMI detection, troponin levels have become an almost universally employed diagnostic tool for patients with a clinical history suggestive of MI. The HEART score has been validated and popularized. The HEART score incorporates the clinician's suspicion, patient risk factors, ECG findings, and troponin levels to assess the patient's risk level. **Laboratory Studies**\nA cardiac troponin test should be the only cardiac marker test ordered. CDC, lipid profile, renal function, and metabolic panel are relevant labs. Cardiac biomarkers are helpful in the diagnosis of AMI, particularly NSTEMI. Troponin, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and LDH are cardiac markers observed. A troponin test is the most specific lab test for early detection of AMI; levels of the troponin isoforms I and T are measured. Troponin levels peak at 12 hours and remain elevated for 7 days. High-sensitivity troponin has been approved for use in the United States after being heavily studied and utilized in Europe. Although it is more sensitive than conventional troponin, it is also less specific. Thus, potential challenges include numerous false-positive interpretations. The level of CK-MB, an isoenzyme of creatine kinase usually found in the myocardium, reaches its peak at 10 hours and normalizes within 2 to 3 days. CK-MB is also not clinically utilized due to its low specificity, rapid rise, and normalization. LDH levels reach their peak after 72 hours and return to normal within 10 to 14 days. In clinical practice, LDH is not used to diagnose acute MI."

In clinical practice, LDH is not used to diagnose acute MI. Treatment / Management\nAll patients with STEMI and NSTEMI require immediate administration of nonenteric-coated, chewable aspirin with a loading dose of 162 mg to 325 mg. Additionally, patients should have intravenous access established, and oxygen supplementation should be administered if their oxygen saturation falls below 91%. Opioids may be used for pain control in addition to sublingual nitroglycerin if the patient's blood pressure is within an acceptable range. The primary treatment approach for STEMI involves immediate reperfusion. The preferred method is emergent PCI. Before PCI, patients should receive dual antiplatelet therapy, which includes intravenous heparin infusion and an adenosine diphosphate inhibitor receptor (P2Y12 inhibitor), most commonly ticagrelor. A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or direct thrombin inhibitor may also be administered during the PCI procedure. If PCI is unavailable within 90 minutes of diagnosing STEMI, reperfusion using an intravenous thrombolytic agent should be attempted. In stable asymptomatic patients with NSTEMI, the initial management approach is typically medical, focusing on using antiplatelet agents and other appropriate medications. However, PCI can be performed within 48 hours of admission if necessary. This delayed PCI strategy has been shown to potentially improve in-hospital mortality and decrease the length of hospital stay for NSTEMI patients. In NSTEMI patients who experience refractory ischemia or ischemia with hemodynamic or electrical instability, PCI should be performed emergently. Before discharge for acute MI, patients may routinely be prescribed aspirin, a high-dose statin, a beta-blocker, and possibly an ACE inhibitor. If PCI is considered the treatment option for an acute MI, it is recommended to perform the procedure within 12 hours of symptom onset."

Prognosis\nAMI carries a significant risk of mortality outside of the hospital environment. Data indicate that at least one-third of patients succumb to the condition before reaching the hospital, and an additional 40% to 50% do not survive upon arrival. Furthermore, another 5% to 10% of patients will experience mortality within the first 12 months after an MI.\nThe prognosis of AMI depends on the extent of muscle damage. Better outcomes are seen in patients who undergo early perfusion, including thrombolytic therapy within 30 minutes of arrival or PCI within 90 minutes. Patients with preserved ejection fraction have better outcomes than those with reduced ejection fraction.\nMedical management following an AMI is crucial for improving long-term outcomes. Initiating medications, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors, is standard practice to help prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.\nFactors that negatively affect prognosis include the following:\n- Diabetes\n- Advanced age\n- Prior MI, peripheral vascular disease, or stroke\n- Delayed reperfusion\n- Diminished ejection fraction (the strongest predictor)\n- Presence of congestive heart failure\n- Elevated C-reactive protein and BNP levels\n- Depression\nA high readmission rate affects about 50% of patients within the first 12 months after the initial MI.

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAn interprofessional team specializing in heart disease manages AMI. In addition to the cardiologist, the team usually consists of a cardiac surgeon, an interventional cardiologist, an intensivist, a cardiac rehabilitation specialist, critical care or cardiology nurses, and physical therapists. Because AMI is potentially life-threatening, it is crucial to prioritize patient education regarding recognizing symptoms and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention. The pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and primary care providers should educate patients regarding nitroglycerin administration, emphasizing when to seek immediate medical attention if the medication does not provide relief. Time to reperfusion is limited, and early initiation of treatment can significantly improve outcomes. The care team's initial assessment needs to be timely and cardiology consulted immediately. The cardiologist evaluates the patient's condition, considering the duration of symptoms and contraindications, to determine the appropriate treatment approach. This may involve thrombolysis or PCI to restore blood flow to the blocked coronary artery. Patients with AMI require close monitoring and specialized care in the ICU. ICU nurses are crucial in monitoring vital signs, administering medications, assessing for complications, and promptly communicating abnormal clinical signs or laboratory parameters to the interprofessional team. Avoiding premature discharge is crucial because complications of an MI can manifest up to a week after the initial event. The interprofessional team should collaborate to ensure patients are stabilized, monitored appropriately, and educated on signs and symptoms that may indicate worsening or recurrent MI. Nurses play a vital role in educating patients about reducing risk factors for coronary artery disease. This education includes lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control."

Risk factors for STEMI include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of plaque instability. The pathogenic mechanism typically involves plaque rupture and thrombus formation within the coronary artery, though other processes may also lead to STEMI.\nDiagnosis of STEMI is confirmed by characteristic findings on electrocardiography, including ST-segment elevation in specific leads. Blood tests, such as elevated cardiac troponins, further support the diagnosis. Immediate treatment involves restoring blood flow to the affected area through reperfusion therapy, typically via percutaneous coronary intervention. Early management is critical to limit myocardial damage, and adjunctive therapies, including antiplatelets and anticoagulants, are often used to prevent further thrombus formation.\nThis activity for healthcare professionals reviews the etiology, epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of STEMI and underscores the integral role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients with this type of myocardial infarction.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify the signs and symptoms suggesting acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.\n- Create a clinically guided diagnostic plan for patients with suspected acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n- Implement evidence-based, individualized management protocols for patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to educate, treat, and monitor individuals with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to improve health outcomes."

Introduction\nAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in myocardial perfusion, presenting as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non\u2013ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or unstable angina. Globally, over 7 million individuals are diagnosed with ACS annually, with more than 1 million cases requiring hospitalization in the United States each year. STEMI results from the complete blockage of a coronary artery and represents about 30% of all ACS cases. An acute STEMI is marked by transmural myocardial ischemia resulting in myocardial injury or necrosis. The current 2018 clinical definition of myocardial infarction requires confirming the presence of ischemic myocardial injury with abnormal cardiac biomarker levels. STEMI is a clinical syndrome involving myocardial ischemia, electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and chest pain (see **Image.** Electrocardiogram Tracing for a Case of Proximal Left Anterior Descending Occlusion).\nIf electrocardiography indicates STEMI, prompt reperfusion through primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 120 minutes can lower mortality from 9% to 7% (see **Image**. ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction on Electrocardiogram). In cases where PCI within this timeframe is not feasible, full-dose fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase should be administered to patients younger than 75 and without contraindications to medical intervention. Individuals 75 and older should receive half the normal dose of fibrinolytic therapy. Alternatively, full-dose streptokinase may be considered when cost is a concern. Following fibrinolytic treatment, patients should be transferred to a facility capable of performing PCI within the next 24 hours."

Etiology\nMyocardial infarction, in general, can be classified into types 1 to 5 based on etiology and pathogenesis. Recent advances in cardiovascular imaging, revised ECG criteria, and high-sensitivity cardiovascular biomarker assays have enhanced the ability to classify the different causes of myocardial infarction more precisely. The underlying pathophysiology of type 1 myocardial infarction differs from that of types 2 through 5. Type 1 myocardial infarction is primarily associated with intracoronary atherothrombosis, whereas the other types may result from various mechanisms, some of which may involve an atherosclerotic component. Type 2 myocardial infarction is characterized by an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis. Types 1 and 2 occur spontaneously, while types 4 and 5 are linked to medical procedures. Type 3 is only identified postmortem. Most types 1 and 2 myocardial infarction cases present as NSTEMI, but some manifest as STEMI (see **Image**. Acute Myocardial Infarction Types).\nA STEMI occurs from the occlusion of 1 or more coronary arteries supplying the heart with blood. The cause of this abrupt disruption of blood flow is usually plaque rupture, erosion, fissuring, or dissection of coronary arteries with obstructive thrombus. The major STEMI risk factors are dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and a family history of coronary artery disease."

Epidemiology\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with low- and middle-resource countries experiencing a disproportionate share of this burden. ACS frequently serves as the initial presentation of CVD. Approximately 5.8 million new cases of ischemic heart disease were reported across the 57 member countries of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2019. The median age-standardized incidence rate was 293.3 per 100,000 people, with an interquartile range of 195.8 to 529.5. CVD continues to be the primary cause of death in ESC countries, contributing to nearly 2.2 million fatalities in women and over 1.9 million deaths in men, according to the latest data. Ischemic heart disease remains the leading cause of CVD mortality, accounting for 38% of deaths in women and 44% in men.\nThe estimated annual incidence of myocardial infarction in the United States includes 550,000 new cases and 200,000 recurrent cases. In 2013, 116,793 persons in the United States experienced a fatal myocardial infarction, with 57% occurring in men and 43% in women. The average age of incidence of a first myocardial infarction is 65.1 for men and 72 for women. Approximately 38% of patients who present to the hospital with ACS have a STEMI."

History and Physical\nAcute chest discomfort, which patients may describe as pain, pressure, tightness, heaviness, or a burning sensation, is the most common symptom that leads healthcare professionals to consider the diagnosis of ACS and initiate appropriate diagnostic testing. Diagnostic delays or errors can occur from an incomplete patient history or challenges in obtaining a clear description of symptoms. Therefore, thorough patient history and detailed communication are essential to understand the complexity of ACS-related symptoms, potentially enabling a prompt and accurate diagnosis.\nObtaining a focused medical history and identifying the presenting symptoms is essential to quickly guide the patient along the appropriate care pathway. A targeted physical examination should involve evaluating all major pulses, measuring blood pressure in both arms, auscultating heart and lung sounds, and assessing for any signs of heart failure or circulatory compromise. Patients should be asked about the characteristics of the pain and associated symptoms, risk factors or history of cardiovascular disease, and recent drug use.\nSTEMI risk factors include age, gender, family history of premature coronary artery disease, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, abdominal obesity, sedentary lifestyle, a diet low in fruits and vegetables, and psychosocial stressors. Cocaine use can cause STEMI regardless of risk factors. Obtaining a history of known congenital abnormalities can be useful during evaluation. Familial hypercholesterolemia is linked to an increased risk of early-onset atherosclerotic disease. In patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, familial hypercholesterolemia correlates with a higher incidence of both STEMI and NSTEMI, fewer cases of type 2 myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and a greater need for multiple stents, coronary bypass surgery, and mechanical circulatory support devices."

Evaluation\n**Electrocardiogram**\nThe resting 12-lead ECG is the primary diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with suspected ACS. An ECG should be performed immediately upon first medical contact and interpreted by a qualified emergency medical technician or physician within 10 minutes. Repeat ECGs may be necessary, mainly if symptoms have subsided during first medical contact. Patients with suspected ACS are typically categorized into 2 main diagnostic groups based on the initial ECG findings. Patients with acute chest pain or equivalent symptoms and persistent ST-segment elevation or its ECG equivalents are given a working diagnosis of STEMI. Most of these patients experience myocardial necrosis and elevated troponin levels, meeting the criteria for myocardial infarction, although not all will have a final diagnosis of STEMI. Patients with acute chest pain or equivalent symptoms without persistent ST-segment elevation or its ECG equivalents are categorized under non\u2013ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). **Guidelines from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, and World Heart Federation**\nEvaluating patients with acute onset of chest pain should begin with an ECG and troponin levels. The American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), ESC, and the World Heart Federation (WHF) committee established the following ECG criteria for STEMI:\n- New ST-segment elevation occurs at the J point in 2 contiguous leads, with a threshold greater than 0.1 mV in all leads except V2 and V3. - In leads V2 and V3, the threshold is greater than 0.2 mV for men older than 40, greater than 0.25 mV for men under 40, and greater than 0.15 mV for women."

Promptly identifying occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) in patients with acute chest pain is crucial to enable rapid revascularization. In left bundle branch block (LBBB) cases, interpreting the ECG can be particularly challenging due to ST-segment changes associated with this pattern. The Sgarbossa criteria were developed to enhance the detection of acute myocardial infarction in patients with LBBB, relying on the concordance between the QRS complex and the ST segment. Typically, in an ECG with LBBB without OMI, the \"principle of appropriate discordance\" applies. The ST segment is oriented opposite to the QRS complex, which means that in leads where the QRS is predominantly positive, the ST segment is negative. Conversely, the ST segment is elevated in leads with a predominantly negative QRS complex. In OMI cases, the ST segment may show \"concordant\" changes with the QRS or exhibit \"excessive\" discordant elevation. The Sgarbossa criteria include this excessively discordant ST elevation (greater than 0.5 mV) as a 3rd criterion, along with concordant ST-segment changes. While these criteria are highly specific, their sensitivity for detecting OMI is limited. Patients with a preexisting LBBB can be further evaluated using the Sgarbossa criteria:\n- ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is concordant with or in the same direction as the QRS complex\n- ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in lead V1, V2, or V3\n- ST-segment elevation of 5 mm or more (that is discordant with or in the opposite direction of the QRS complex)\nThe ACC, AHA, and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) have issued class I recommendations based on recent evidence. For patients experiencing STEMI with ischemic symptoms lasting less than 12 hours, PCI is recommended to enhance survival outcomes. In cases of STEMI where reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy is unsuccessful, performing rescue PCI on the infarct-related artery is advised to improve clinical outcomes."

Primary PCI is recommended for patients with STEMI who present with cardiogenic shock or acute severe heart failure, regardless of the time elapsed since the onset of the myocardial infarction. **Cardiac Biomarkers**\nOnce STEMI and very high-risk NSTE-ACS are ruled out, biomarkers become essential for confirming the diagnosis, assessing risk, and managing suspected cases of ACS. Measuring a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, such as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), is recommended for all patients with suspected ACS. If the clinical presentation aligns with myocardial ischemia, an elevation or decrease in hs-cTn levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy population supports the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, according to the 4th universal definition of this condition. Hs-cTn assays offer greater sensitivity and diagnostic precision for detecting myocardial infarction upon presentation, allowing for a shorter interval between the first and second troponin measurements. Timely serial measurements lead to faster diagnosis and reduce emergency department stays, healthcare costs, and patient diagnostic uncertainty. The preferred approach is the 0-hour/1-hour algorithm, with the 0-hour/2-hour algorithm as an alternative. These algorithms have been developed and validated through extensive multicenter diagnostic studies using centralized adjudication of the final diagnosis for all currently available hs-cTn assays. **Transthoracic Echocardiogram**\nFor patients with suspected ACS where the diagnosis is uncertain, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can help identify signs indicative of ongoing ischemia or previous myocardial infarction. However, the use of TTE should not cause significant delays in transferring the patient to the cardiac catheterization laboratory if an acute coronary artery occlusion is suspected. Additionally, TTE can help identify other potential causes of chest pain, such as acute aortic disease and right ventricular signs associated with pulmonary embolism. **Computed Tomography**\nComputed tomography (CT) is frequently the preferred diagnostic tool when excluding other potentially life-threatening conditions that may mimic ACS, such as pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection."

    "text": "Additionally, TTE can help identify other potential causes of chest pain, such as acute aortic disease and right ventricular signs associated with pulmonary embolism. **Computed Tomography**\nComputed tomography (CT) is frequently the preferred diagnostic tool when excluding other potentially life-threatening conditions that may mimic ACS, such as pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. Treatment / Management\nAfter diagnosing acute STEMI, intravenous access should be obtained, and cardiac monitoring should be started. Timely treatment is crucial for patients classified under the STEMI pathway. Key factors include the total ischemic time, sources of delays in initial management, and the choice of reperfusion strategy for patients with STEMI. The efficiency and quality of care a system provides for individuals with suspected STEMI are reflected in these treatment times. Patients who are hypoxemic or at risk for hypoxemia benefit from oxygen therapy. However, results from recent studies show possible harmful effects in patients who are normoxic. Patients should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of presentation at a PCI-capable hospital or within 120 minutes if transfer to a PCI-capable hospital is required. If PCI is not possible within 120 minutes of first medical contact, fibrinolytic therapy should be initiated within 30 minutes of the patient's arrival at the hospital. Patients should be promptly transferred to a PCI center after starting lytic therapy. If fibrinolysis fails or signs of reocclusion or reinfarction, such as recurring ST-segment elevation, emerge, immediate angiography and rescue PCI is necessary. Further administration of fibrinolytic is not recommended in such cases. Even when fibrinolysis appears successful, as indicated by significant resolution of ST-segment elevation (ie, >50% at 60\u201390 minutes), typical reperfusion arrhythmias, and relief of chest pain, early angiography within 2 to 24 hours is still advised. Conditions that can mimic ACS, such as acute aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism, must be ruled out."

Conditions that can mimic ACS, such as acute aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism, must be ruled out. Manual thrombus aspiration before PCI in patients with STEMI is a quick and cost-effective technique to reduce microvascular obstruction following PCI. While the TAPAS study (Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction) initially suggested that thrombus aspiration before PCI could offer clinical benefits compared to PCI alone, subsequent research and meta-analyses did not significantly improve clinical outcomes. Additionally, concerns about patient safety have emerged, with evidence demonstrating a higher risk of stroke in those undergoing thrombus aspiration compared to PCI alone, both at 1 month and 1 year postprocedure. Reflecting these findings, the 2023 ESC guidelines for managing ACS advise against routine thrombus aspiration (Class III, Level of Evidence A). However, the guidelines suggest that thrombus aspiration may be considered in certain STEMI cases, particularly those with a high thrombotic burden following PCI. **Pharmacological Therapy**\nNitroglycerin administration can reduce anginal pain. However, this drug should be avoided in patients who have used phosphodiesterase-inhibiting medication within the last 24 hours and in cases of right ventricular infarction. Morphine can be given for further pain relief to patients who continue to report discomfort after nitroglycerin administration. However, reasonable use is not recommended, as it may adversely affect outcomes. All patients with an acute myocardial infarction should be started on a beta blocker, high-intensity statin, aspirin, and a P2Y12 inhibitor as soon as possible, with certain exceptions. Aspirin therapy for ACS begins with a loading dose administered as early as possible, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 to 100 mg once daily. Based on the results from the PLATO (PLATlet inhibition and patient Outcomes) and TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasurgrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38) studies, dual antiplatelet therapy combining aspirin with a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, such as prasugrel or ticagrelor, is the recommended strategy for most individuals with ACS."

Clopidogrel may also be considered in patients aged 70 or older. P2Y-inhibiting antiplatelet medication choice depends on whether the patient underwent PCI or fibrinolytic therapy. Due to results from recent trials showing superiority, ticagrelor and prasugrel are preferred over clopidogrel in patients who undergo PCI. Individuals undergoing fibrinolytic therapy should be started on clopidogrel. The relative contraindications of P2Y12 inhibitors should always be considered. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack and stroke. Anticoagulation should also be started alongside unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux. Lipid-lowering therapy must be initiated as soon as possible following an ACS event, as the treatment is crucial for improving long-term prognosis and enhancing patient adherence after discharge. High-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, should be started early, ideally before any planned PCI, and prescribed at the highest tolerated dose to achieve target low-density lipoprotein-C levels. Recent studies support \u03b2-blocker benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after ACS. However, the evidence for using these drugs in patients with LVEF greater than 40% following uncomplicated ACS is less definitive. Except for the results from the CAPRICORN trial (CArvedilol Post-infaRct survIval COntRolled evaluatioN), which focused on patients with LVEF less than or equal to 40%, most large randomized controlled trials evaluating postmyocardial infarction \u03b2-blocker therapy were conducted before the widespread use of reperfusion therapies.

Differential Diagnosis\nOther pathologies that can cause ST-segment elevation include myocarditis, pericarditis, stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo), benign early repolarization, acute vasospasm (Prinzmetal), spontaneous coronary artery dissection, LBBB, various channelopathies, and electrolyte abnormalities. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, often referred to as \"broken heart syndrome,\" is a distinct cardiac condition that has garnered increased interest in recent years. Originally identified in Japan in the early 1990s, this syndrome is marked by abrupt and profound dysfunction of the left ventricle, frequently precipitated by intense emotional stress or major life events. Unlike a conventional myocardial infarction caused by blocked coronary arteries, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs without significant coronary obstructions, setting it apart as a unique and perplexing cardiac disorder. Prinzmetal angina, or vasospastic angina (VSA), arises from spontaneous coronary artery spasms, which can result in serious complications, particularly in individuals with increased coronary vasoconstriction and reduced vasodilation. Early identification of patients at risk is crucial to prevent severe or fatal outcomes. While the exact prevalence of VSA remains uncertain, a study in Japan found that it may affect around 40% of individuals with angina, possibly higher than in White populations due to differences in clinical testing methods. The primary treatment strategy involves using vasodilators and managing risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, lipid levels, stress, and alcohol consumption. VSA may also be linked to migraines. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is characterized by a tear in the epicardial coronary arteries, neither caused by medical procedures nor related to trauma or atherosclerosis. Unlike the intraluminal thrombosis or plaque rupture that typically leads to ACS, SCAD-induced ACS results from myocardial damage from coronary artery obstruction following intimal disruption or the formation of an intramural hematoma, which creates a false lumen."

Prognosis\nThe Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score is a straightforward tool that uses 8 prognostic factors to evaluate the risk associated with STEMI at the bedside. The TIMI risk score is the most commonly used scoring system for 30-day mortality. This scoring system incorporates:\n- Age older than 75 is assigned 3 points. Age between 64 and 74 is assigned 2 points.\n- Diabetes, hypertension, or a history of angina is assigned 1 point.\n- A systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg is assigned 3 points.\n- A heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is assigned 2 points.\n- Killip class II to IV is assigned 2 points.\n- A body weight less than 150 lbs is assigned 1 point.\nThe TIMI score ranges from 0 to 14, with each point representing a different level of risk based on the patient\u2019s condition. This scoring system helps predict mortality within the first 30 days following STEMI and is reliable for forecasting outcomes in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy. Studies have applied the TIMI score to estimate mortality rates in anterior wall STEMI cases. The TIMI score can help classify patients based on risk categories. Risk levels are categorized as low for scores ranging from 0 to 4, medium for scores between 5 and 9, and high for scores above 9. Mortality rates at 30 days for patients presenting with STEMI are between 2.5% and 10%."

Mortality rates at 30 days for patients presenting with STEMI are between 2.5% and 10%. Complications\nMyocardial infarction has 3 life-threatening mechanical complications: ventricular free wall rupture, interventricular septum rupture, and acute mitral regurgitation. Ventricular free wall rupture occurs within 5 days in half the cases and 2 weeks in 90% of cases, with an overall mortality rate of greater than 80%. Interventricular septum rupture is reported about half as often as free wall rupture and typically occurs in 3 to 5 days, with an overall mortality rate greater than 70%. Prompt surgery reduces the mortality rate in both conditions. Acute mitral regurgitation following a myocardial infarction is most commonly due to ischemic papillary muscle displacement, left ventricular dilatation, or rupture of the papillary muscle or chordae. In STEMI, the degree of mitral regurgitation is usually severe and associated with a 30-day survival of 24%.\nInflammation of the pericardium, known as pericarditis, and pericardial effusion resulting from pericardial injury are collectively referred to as postcardiac injury syndrome. This syndrome includes conditions such as postmyocardial infarction, pericarditis (Dressler syndrome), postpericardiotomy syndrome, and posttraumatic pericarditis. Even minor injuries, like those from PCI, cardiac implantable electronic device placement, or radiofrequency ablation, can provoke cardiac injury. These conditions share a common trigger of pericardial or pleural damage, leading to a pleuropericardial syndrome characterized by pericarditis with pericardial effusion and pleural effusion."

Myocardial infarction may be\"silent,\" and go undetected, or it could be a catastrophic event leading to hemodynamic deterioration and sudden death. Most myocardial infarctions are due to underlying coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. With coronary artery occlusion, the myocardium is deprived of oxygen. Prolonged deprivation of oxygen supply to the myocardium can lead to myocardial cell death and necrosis. Patients can present with chest discomfort or pressure that can radiate to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arm. In addition to the history and physical exam, myocardial ischemia may be associated with ECG changes and elevated biochemical markers such as cardiac troponins. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of myocardial infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.\n**Objectives:**\n- Review the basic pathophysiology of myocardial infarction.\n- Explain the management protocol when presented with acute myocardial infarction, including all necessary laboratory and other diagnostic testing.\n- Summarize the long-term management and rehabilitation for a patient post-MI.\n- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the prevention and management of myocardial infarction leading to improved outcomes."

Etiology\nAs stated above, myocardial infarction is closely associated with coronary artery disease. INTERHEART is an international multi-center case-control study which delineated the following modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease:\n1. Smoking\n1. Abnormal lipid profile/blood apolipoprotein (raised ApoB/ApoA1)\n1. Hypertension\n1. Diabetes mellitus\n1. Abdominal obesity (waist/hip ratio) (greater than 0.90 for males and greater than 0.85 for females)\n1. Psychosocial factors such as depression, loss of the locus of control, global stress, financial stress, and life events including marital separation, job loss, and family conflicts\n1. Lack of daily consumption of fruits or vegetables\n1. Lack of physical activity\n1. Alcohol consumption (weaker association, protective)\nThe INTERHEART study showed that all the above risk factors were significantly associated with acute myocardial infarction except for alcohol consumption, which showed a weaker association. Smoking and abnormal apolipoprotein ratio showed the strongest association with acute myocardial infarction. The increased risk associated with diabetes and hypertension were found to be higher in women, and the protective effect of exercise and alcohol was also found to be higher in women.\nOther risk factors include a moderately high level of plasma homocysteine, which is an independent risk factor of MI. Elevated plasma homocysteine is potentially modifiable and can be treated with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12.\nSome non-modifiable risk factors for myocardial infarction include advanced age, male gender (males tend to have myocardial infarction earlier in life), genetics (there is an increased risk of MI if a first-degree relative has a history of cardiovascular events before the age of 50). The role of genetic loci that increase the risk for MI is under active investigation."

The patient\u2019s history, electrocardiographic findings, and elevated serum biomarkers help identify ischemic symptoms. Myocardial ischemia can present as chest pain, upper extremity pain, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort that occurs during exertion or at rest. Myocardial ischemia can also present as dyspnea or fatigue, which are known to be ischemic equivalents. The chest pain is usually retrosternal and is sometimes described as the sensation of pressure or heaviness. The pain often radiates to the left shoulder, neck, or arms with no obvious precipitating factors, and it may be intermittent or persistent. The pain usually lasts for more than 20 minutes. It is usually not affected by positional changes or active movement of the region. Additional symptoms, such as sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and syncope, may also be present. The MI can also present atypically with subtle findings such as palpitations, or more dramatic manifestations, such as cardiac arrest. The MI can sometimes present with no symptoms."

The MI can also present atypically with subtle findings such as palpitations, or more dramatic manifestations, such as cardiac arrest. The MI can sometimes present with no symptoms. Evaluation\nThe three components in the evaluation of the MI are clinical features, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers. **ECG**\nThe resting 12 lead ECG is the first-line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It should be obtained within 10 minutes of the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department. Acute MI is often associated with dynamic changes in the ECG waveform. Serial ECG monitoring can provide important clues to the diagnosis if the initial EKG is non-diagnostic at initial presentation. Serial or continuous ECG recordings may help determine reperfusion or re-occlusion status. A large and prompt reduction in ST-segment elevation is usually seen in reperfusion. ECG findings suggestive of ongoing coronary artery occlusion (in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch block):\n_ST-segment elevation in two contiguous lead (measured at J-point) of_\n1.

ECG findings alone are not sufficient to diagnose acute myocardial ischemia or acute MI as other conditions such as acute pericarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left bundle branch block (LBBB), Brugada syndrome, Takatsubo syndrome (TTS), and early repolarization patterns also present with ST deviation.

Elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin are not specific to the underlying mode of injury (ischemic vs. tension) . The rising and/or falling pattern of cardiac troponins (cTn) values with at least one value above the 99 percentile of upper reference limit (URL) associated with symptoms of myocardial ischemia would indicate an acute MI. Serial testing of cTn values at 0 hours, 3 hours, and 6 hours would give a better perspective on the severity and time course of the myocardial injury. Depending on the baseline cTn value, the rising/falling pattern is interpreted. If the cTn baseline value is markedly elevated, a minimum change of greater than 20% in follow up testing is significant for myocardial ischemia. Creatine kinase MB isoform can also be used in the diagnosis of MI, but it is less sensitive and specific than cTn level."

Treatment / Management\n**Acute Management**\nReperfusion therapy is indicated in all patients with symptoms of ischemia of less than 12-hours duration and persistent ST-segment elevation. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is preferred to fibrinolysis if the procedure can be performed \\<120 minutes of ECG diagnosis. If there is no immediate option of PCI (>120 minutes), fibrinolysis should be started within 10 minutes of STEMI after ruling out contraindications. If transfer to a PCI center is possible in 60 to 90 minutes after a bolus of the fibrinolytic agent and patient meets reperfusion criteria, a routine PCI can be done, or a rescue PCI can be planned. If fibrinolysis is planned, it should be carried out with fibrin-specific agents such as tenecteplase, alteplase, or reteplase (class I). _Relief of pain, breathlessness, and anxiety:_ The chest pain due to myocardial infarction is associated with sympathetic arousal, which causes vasoconstriction and increased workload for the ischemic heart. Intravenous opioids (e.g., morphine) are the analgesics most commonly used for pain relief (Class IIa). The results from CRUSADE quality improvement initiative have shown that the use of morphine may be associated with a higher risk of death and adverse clinical outcomes. The study was done from the CIRCUS (Does Cyclosporine Improve outcome in STEMI patients) database, which showed no significant adverse events associated with morphine use in a case of anterior ST-segment elevation MI. A mild anxiolytic (usually a benzodiazepine) may be considered in very anxious patients (class IIa).

The dose is titrated upward until symptoms are relieved, blood pressure is normalized in hypertensive patients, or side effects such as a headache and hypotension are noted. _Beta-blockers:_ This group of drugs reduces myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. They block beta receptors in the body, including the heart, and reduce the effects of circulating catecholamines. Beta-blockers should not be used in suspected coronary vasospasm. _Platelet inhibition:_ Aspirin is recommended in both STEMI and NSTEMI in an oral loading dose of 150 to 300 mg (non-enteric coated formulation) and a maintenance dose of 75 to 100 mg per day long-term regardless of treatment strategy (class I). Aspirin inhibits thromboxane A2 production throughout the lifespan of the platelet. Most P2Y12 inhibitors are inactive prodrugs (except for ticagrelor, which is an orally active drug that does not require activation) that require oxidation by hepatic cytochrome P450 system to generate an active metabolite which selectively inhibits P2Y12 receptors irreversibly. Inhibition of P2Y12 receptors leads to inhibition of ATP induced platelet aggregation. The commonly used P2Y12 inhibitors are clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. The loading dose for clopidogrel is 300 to 600 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day. Prasugrel, 60 mg loading dose, and 10 mg per day of a maintenance dose have a faster onset when compared to clopidogrel. Patients undergoing PCI should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor and a parenteral anticoagulant. In PCI, the use of prasugrel or ticagrelor is found to be superior to clopidogrel. Aspirin and clopidogrel are also found to decrease the number of ischemic events in NSTEMI and UA. The anticoagulants used during PCI are unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and bivalirudin. The bivalirudin is recommended during primary PCI if the patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic heart disease are best done with an interprofessional team. In most hospitals, there are cardiology teams that are dedicated to the management of these patients.\nFor patients who present with chest pain, the key to the management of MI is time to treatment. Thus, healthcare professionals, including nurses who work in the emergency department, must be familiar with the symptoms of MI and the importance of rapid triage. A cardiology consult should be made immediately to ensure that the patient gets treated within the time frame recommendations. Because MI can be associated with several serious complications, these patients are best managed in an ICU setting.\nThere is no cure for ischemic heart disease, and all treatments are symptom-oriented. The key to improving outcomes is to prevent coronary artery disease. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the benefits of a healthy diet, the importance of controlling blood pressure and diabetes, exercising regularly, discontinuing smoking, maintaining healthy body weight, and remaining compliant with medications. The pharmacist should educate the patient on types of medication used to treat ischemic heart disease, their benefits, and potential adverse effects.\nOnly through such a team approach can the morbidity and mortality of myocardial infarction be lowered."

Introduction\nMyocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death globally. It involves irreversible necrosis of the cardiac muscle due to reduced blood supply caused by the occlusion of coronary arteries. MI represents a significant but preventable contributor to morbidity and mortality rates. Clinically, the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is established when there is an elevation in cardiac biomarkers, coupled with evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, which can include angina, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior wall myocardial infarction (AWMI) occurs when there is a reduction in blood supply to the anterior wall of the heart, resulting from occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Anterior myocardial infarction is associated with higher mortality and morbidity than other acute myocardial infarctions locations. It is linked to increased in-hospital mortality, greater reduction in left ventricle ejection fraction, and a higher incidence of congestive heart failure compared to infarctions occurring in other areas of the heart. Anterior myocardial infarction can be classified into different categories based on the anatomical location of the occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. These categories are as follows:\n1. Proximal LAD: Proximal to first septal perforator. On ECG findings, ST elevation is evident in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. It may also present as a new bundle branch block or a fascicular block. 1. Mid-LAD: Distal to the first septal perforator but proximal to the first large diagonal branch. ECG findings reveal ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. Bundle branches are usually preserved. 1. Distal LAD: Distal to large diagonal or large diagonal itself."

Bundle branches are usually preserved. 1. Distal LAD: Distal to large diagonal or large diagonal itself. Etiology\n**Plaque Rupture (also known as plaque fissure)**\nMost AWMIs occur due to the disruption of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to exposure to thrombogenic contents. A thrombus forms when blood flow encounters the necrotic core within the coronary artery. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture, also known as plaque fissure, is characterized by a necrotic core with an eroded thin cap, followed by thrombus formation, and is the most common cause of anterior MI. Anterior myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to sustained ischemia caused by the occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery\u2014this acute reduction of blood supply to the myocardium results in necrosis of the heart muscle. The thrombus formed at the site of plaque rupture in anterior myocardial infarction (MI) typically exhibits a white appearance (platelet-rich) at the site of rupture while appearing red at the margins (composed of red blood cells and fibrin). Thrombus formation involves a complex interplay of different cellular and non-cellular components within the blood. The breakdown of the extracellular matrix is a key factor in the exact cause of plaque rupture, with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) playing a significant role. MMPs contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, leading to positive remodeling and core expansion, which contribute to plaque progression. The initial disruption of fibrillar collagen occurs through the action of MMPs, creating a vulnerability within the plaque. Additionally, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, as well as elastolysis, may also contribute to plaque rupture. These processes collectively contribute to the pathophysiology of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation in conditions such as anterior myocardial infarction."

These processes collectively contribute to the pathophysiology of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation in conditions such as anterior myocardial infarction. **Plaque Erosion**\nPlaque erosion is the second most common cause of acute coronary syndrome, differing from plaque rupture by the absence of fibrous cap disintegration or fissure. In plaque erosion, there is a lack of communication between the necrotic core and the luminal thrombus. The thrombus appears white and contains abundant neutrophils, while smooth muscle cells are interspersed. The necrotic core is small, and there is a lack of endothelial lining due to apoptosis. This allows the blood components to encounter the collagen, leading to thrombus formation. The site of plaque erosion is rich in proteoglycan and hyaluronan, in contrast to the site of plaque rupture, which has little. Optical coherence tomography can help differentiate between plaque erosion and rupture. **Microvascular and Coronary Spasm**\nSpasm is a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome without thrombus formation. In these cases, the constriction of the microvessels or coronary arteries leads to inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, resulting in ischemia and subsequent symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. This phenomenon, often called vasospastic angina or variant angina, can occur spontaneously or be triggered by various factors, such as stress, cold temperatures, or certain medications. **AWMI Risk Factors**\n- Hypertension\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Smoking\n- Dyslipidemia\n- Family history of premature coronary artery disease\n- Overweight or obesity\n- Age and gender\n- Inflammation\n- Diet - high glycemic index and low fiber, red meat, trans-fatty acid. - Lack of exercise"

Findings from the Framingham study revealed that over 10 years, the incidence of MI was 12.9 per 1,000 males (aged 30 to 34) and 5.2 per 1,000 females (aged 35 to 44). This increased by 8 to 9 times in people aged 55 to 64. However, AMI's epidemiology has changed with advancements in diagnosis and management. A 2000 to 2014 study analyzed the annual change in percentages for AMI hospitalizations, including ST-elevation and non-ST elevation MI. The findings indicate a significant decline in AMI hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years across all ethnicities after adjusting for age and gender. Across the United States, a notable disparity exists in outcomes for AMI, with certain states experiencing poorer results. Lagging states exhibit higher incidence and prevalence rates of AMI, increased mortality associated with AMI, and lower life expectancy overall. Compared with the developed world, South-Asian countries face a relatively higher burden of AMI and coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD remains a significant public health concern. According to 2013 data, cardiovascular disease, including CAD, accounts for approximately 1 in every 3 deaths in the United States. For every hospitalized patient with MI, an estimated 30 patients have stable angina. Furthermore, the prevalence of CAD increases with age for both men and women. While the prevalence of CAD has not decreased, the mortality rate from MI has declined. This encouraging trend can be attributed to advancements in treatment strategies and improved management of MI."

This encouraging trend can be attributed to advancements in treatment strategies and improved management of MI. Pathophysiology\nErosion or rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque in LAD leads to thrombus formation. Erosion of the plaque exposes thrombogenic lipid core or subendothelial tissue, leading to enhanced vascular inflammatory activity and thrombus formation. The disruption of endothelial continuity facilitates the accumulation of thrombogenic blood components, forming a thrombus. The integrity of the fibrous cap is maintained through a delicate equilibrium between collagen synthesis and degradation. Various cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage chemoattractant proteins, and macrophage colony-stimulating factors, participate in the inflammatory response. The central region of the thrombus is predominantly composed of platelets, giving it a 'white' appearance. In contrast, the proximal and distal ends of the thrombus appear 'red' due to the accumulation of fibrin and red blood cells. A thrombus and vasospasm can reduce blood supply to the myocardium, leading to ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction. The consequences of acute myocardial infarction arise as a result of the following series of pathophysiological events:\n**Systolic dysfunction and cardiogenic shock** : Disruption in the blood supply along the LAD leads to compromised myocardium contractility. Consequently, several manifestations may occur, including dyssynchrony (uncoordinated contraction of different myocardial segments), hypokinesia (reduced endocardial thickening), akinesia (absent endocardial thickening), or dyskinesia (paradoxical endocardial motion and bulging of the endocardial layer). The non-infarcted segments of the myocardium may exhibit compensatory hyperkinesia, which usually resolves in 2 weeks following the ischemic insult. Ischemia in remote areas of the heart can arise from the loss of collateral circulation originating from the occluded artery or a previous occlusion. This systolic dysfunction causes a decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and blood pressure."

This systolic dysfunction causes a decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and blood pressure. The rate of pressure change (dP/dt) also drops, leading to an increase in end-systolic ventricular volume. Conversely, a drop in end-systolic volume is one of the most significant predictors of outcomes in acute myocardial infarction. Ventricular dyskinesia creates a mechanical disadvantage, contributing to decreased stroke volume. The elongation and dilation of ischemic segments further promote the expansion of the infarct. A noticeable decline in ejection fraction is observed when more than 15% of the myocardium is compromised. Clinical indications of heart failure and cardiogenic shock typically become evident after losing 40% of the myocardium. As ejection fraction decreases, left ventricular end-diastolic pressures increase, and dP/dt decreases. The rate of change in ventricular pressure during isovolumetric contraction, known as dP/dt, represents ventricular contractile function. A value below 1,000 mmHg/sec is considered abnormal. **Diastolic dysfunction:** Characterized by elevated left ventricular filling pressures and altered dP/dt. In ischemia, ventricular relaxation is slowed, increasing filling pressures within the left ventricle. **Circulatory regulation** : Reduced stroke volume and cardiac output result in reduced coronary perfusion pressure, worsening ischemia. This cycle may lead to cardiogenic shock. Myocardial infarction also initiates a systemic inflammatory response in the body. The release of inflammatory cytokines contributes to hypotension by causing vasodilation and reduced systemic vascular resistance. In addition, the depressed left ventricular function increases left ventricular volume, leading to elevated wall tension and increased afterload. This further decreases stroke volume, exacerbating ischemia. Hyperkinesia of non-infarcted segments serves as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the reduction in stroke volume. The increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) causes pulmonary congestion and hypoxemia, contributing to ischemia."

Histopathology\nThe gross pathological, histochemical, light microscopic, and ultrastructural findings vary with coronary occlusion and ischemia onset. - Gross alterations become evident after 6 to 12 hours. Gross pathology reveals evidence of transmural infarction or myocardial necrosis in most cases of occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, within hours of infarction, histo-chemically, the necrotic area appears pale with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, indicating a lack of staining, whereas the uninfarcted area appears brick red. - The primary sequence of events in myocardial infarction involves hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis, followed by contraction band necrosis, and eventually, delayed inflammation and repair. - Temporally, a sequential series of changes can be observed in myocardial infarction, beginning with the waviness of myocardial fibers, coagulation necrosis, myocardial edema, focal hemorrhage, and neutrophilic infiltration. This is followed by ongoing coagulation necrosis and pallor due to shrunken cells and contraction band necrosis. Subsequently, there is loss of striation (around 8 hours) and further necrosis with continued neutrophilic infiltration. This cascade of events leads to the disintegration of myocardial fibers and subsequent phagocytosis, resulting in a soft yellow-brown core surrounded by a hyperemic border. After complete phagocytosis, granulation tissue formation occurs along with neo-vascularization and a fibrous reaction (around 14 days), ultimately forming an organized fibrous scar (approximately 3 months). - Electron microscopy reveals early signs of myocardial damage, such as depletion of glycogen granules and swelling of mitochondrial and sarcolemma, which can be observed as early as 20 minutes after the onset of ischemia. This is followed by further mitochondrial disruption, formation of amorphous aggregates, and relaxation of myofibrils, typically occurring around 60 minutes."

The intensity of the pain experienced by patients varies. Still, it is often most severe in individuals who seek medical attention due to their inability to tolerate the discomfort or extreme exhaustion following the episode of pain. The pain classically lasts longer than 30 minutes and can persist for hours if revascularization is not performed. Patients typically describe the pain as constricting, squeezing, or a heavy sensation in the chest. The discomfort is commonly felt retrosternally and may radiate to the bilateral shoulder, jaw/neck, or left arm. The pain may also cause numbness or tingling sensation in the ulnar aspect of the arm. Women may present with atypical symptoms, necessitating more suspicion and careful evaluation. Some patients may show atypical symptoms such as heart failure, extreme nervousness, apprehension, or even psychosis. Additionally, symptoms of systemic embolization can also be observed in some cases. Associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. History should include characteristics and duration of symptoms, aggravating and relieving factors, and the patient's functional capacity. In addition, patients should undergo a quick evaluation for risk factors like diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, previous history of CAD, family history, illicit drug use, and medication history and compliance. **Physical Examination**\nPatients with anterior wall myocardial infarction may exhibit the following signs:\n- Anxious, restless, anguished face\n- Clutching chest or holding a clenched fist against the sternum (Levine sign)\n- Signs of heart failure, such as cold and pale skin, perspiration, propped-up position in bed, gasping for breath, or frothy pink sputum\n- Cardiogenic shock signs include cool, clammy skin, severe nail beds and lips cyanosis, and hemodynamic instability."

However, awaiting the results should not delay reperfusion in patients with clinical evidence of ischemia and anterior ST elevation on EKG. When using a high-sensitivity assay, evidence of ischemia can be obtained within 2 to 3 hours of presentation. Serial testing is recommended for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with negative initial troponin results. **Serologic testing:** Renal function test, liver function test, and lipid panel are essential components of a comprehensive assessment of anterior myocardial infarction. **Chest X-ray (CXR):** In patients without heart failure, CXR is typically unremarkable. However, in the setting of pulmonary edema, it may show interstitial prominence, alveolar infiltrates, and hilar cephalization of pulmonary vessels. The presence of pulmonary edema is associated with a poor prognosis. **Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE):** Urgent revascularization should not be delayed in patients with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, TTE can be helpful if symptoms or ECG changes are equivocal. TTE helps defines wall motion abnormalities in a territorial distribution of the LAD artery. Wall motion abnormalities are seen in the apical, anterior septal, and anterior segments. Additionally, TTE is valuable in identifying mechanical complications, such as ventricular septal rupture, mitral regurgitation, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm in myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Ejection fraction, initially determined by echocardiogram, strongly predicts survival and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with anterior myocardial infarction. **Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR):** In patients presenting with late anterior wall infarction, CMR is instrumental in assessing myocardial viability."

The recommended dose is 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin, which can be repeated every 5 minutes for 3 doses if the pain persists. If the chest pain persists or there is inadequate relief, the need for intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin should be considered. IV nitroglycerin can provide more sustained and controlled vasodilation and may be necessary in severe or refractory chest pain cases. Nitrites should be avoided in patients with systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg, severe bradycardia, suspected RV infarction, and those receiving a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the last 24 hours. **Oxygen** : Maintaining adequate oxygenation is crucial to meet the myocardial oxygen demand. Supplemental oxygen should be considered when the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) falls below 90%. For patients without COPD, supplemental oxygen can be administered at a flow rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute via nasal cannula. This standard starting range can be adjusted based on the patient's response and subsequent oxygen saturation levels. **Analgesia** : Administration of morphine can be beneficial in providing pain relief, alleviating anxiety, and assisting in managing pulmonary edema. **Aspirin** : An initial dose of 162 mg to 325 mg of aspirin is recommended for all patients with AMI before undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The commonly used P2Y12 inhibitors and their recommended dosing regimens are as follows:\n1. **Clopidogrel** :\n- Loading Dose: A loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel should be administered as early as possible or at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). - Maintenance Dose: Following the loading dose, a daily maintenance dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel should be continued for the prescribed duration, typically up to 12 months or as determined by the treating physician. 1. **Prasugrel** :\n- Loading Dose: A loading dose of 60 mg of prasugrel should be given at the time of PCI. - Maintenance Dose: A daily maintenance dose of 10 mg of prasugrel is recommended after the loading dose. 1. **Ticagrelor** :\n- Loading Dose: An loading dose of 180 mg of ticagrelor should be administered as early as possible or at the time of PCI. - Maintenance Dose: Following the loading dose, a twice-daily maintenance dose of 90 mg of ticagrelor should be continued. **Reperfusion** : Reperfusion is the mainstay of treatment in acute MI. In patients with anterior STEMI, timely PCI is recommended. - PCI within 90 minutes of First Medical Contact (FMC): In patients with anterior STEMI, the goal is to perform PCI within 90 minutes of initial medical contact. This includes the time from the patient's arrival at the hospital or when medical personnel first assess the patient. - Door-in-Door-out (DIDO) time for non-PCI-capable hospitals: If the patient initially presents to a hospital without PCI capabilities, the DIDO time should be less than 30 minutes."

This refers to the time it takes for the patient to be transferred from a non-PCI-capable hospital to a PCI-capable hospital. - The recommended goal is to achieve a first medical contact to intervention time of fewer than 120 minutes, aiming for prompt reperfusion to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery. - If the door-in-door-out time is greater than 30 minutes, and the first medical contact to intervention time is greater than 120 minutes, a fibrinolytic agent should be administered within 30 minutes of arrival. Evidence of failed reperfusion will require urgent transfer to a PCI-capable hospital. - Patients with STEMI who meet the criteria should undergo emergent PCI as the preferred reperfusion strategy. Indications for emergent PCI are as follows: ischemic symptoms for less than 12 hours, absolute contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy regardless of time delay from the first medical contact, cardiogenic shock, or acute severe heart failure. - Early reperfusion leads to decreased complications and a better prognosis. PCI has demonstrated superiority to thrombolytic therapy in reducing short-term and long-term adverse cardiac events in patients with anterior acute MI. - Routine thrombectomy before PCI is not recommended. PCI of the non-infarct related artery may be considered in stable patients during primary PCI or as a staged procedure. **Treatment at a non-PCI capable facility with a delay of more than 120 minutes from** **FMC to primary PCI:** Thrombolytic therapy should be given if the onset of symptoms is less than 12 hours (class I) or the onset of symptoms is 12 to 24 hours, but there is clinical evidence of ongoing ischemia with potential for large myocardium damage or hemodynamic instability. If a patient develops cardiogenic shock or has refractory heart failure after receiving thrombolytic therapy, they should be transferred for immediate angiography and possible PCI."

A patient may also require transfer for immediate angiography and possible PCI if there is evidence of failed reperfusion or re-occlusion of the infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy. For stable patients who have received successful thrombolysis, elective PCI can be considered between 3 and 24 hours after thrombolysis to assess further and treat the coronary artery. **Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy for** **patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy** :\n1. **Aspirin** :\n- Loading dose: 162 to 325 mg\n- Maintenance dose: 81 to 325 mg maintenance dose\n1. **Clopidogrel** :\n- Loading dose for age \\<75: 300 mg loading dose\n- Maintenance dose for age \\<75: 75 mg maintenance. - Loading dose for age >75: no loading dose\n- Maintenance dose for age>75: 75 mg daily for 14 days and up to 1 year\n1. **Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)** :\n- Maintain aPTT 1.5 to 2 times of control\n- Based on the age and renal function, enoxaparin may be considered. **Anticoagulation** : Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after thrombolysis and during PCI is necessary to prevent thrombosis. In patients undergoing PCI, UFH boluses should be administered to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), taking into consideration whether Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is being used. Alternatively, bivalirudin can be used as an anticoagulant during PCI. However, fondaparinux should not be used as a sole anticoagulant in STEMI. **Beta-blocker** : Administer oral beta-blockers in patients without contraindications, especially in tachyarrhythmia or hypertension. Beta-blockers are commonly used to manage acute MI for several beneficial effects, such as reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, prevention of reinfarction, antiarrhythmic effects, and improvement of left ventricular function. **High-intensity statin therapy:** To manage AMI, patients without contraindications should be prescribed high-intensity statin therapy, such as atorvastatin 80 mg.\n**Adjunctive therapy:** Adjunctive therapy plays a crucial role in managing AMI."

Complications\nAnterior wall myocardial infarction can be associated with various complications, including:\n- **Cardiogenic shock:** In severe cases of AWMI, extensive damage to the left ventricle can cause a significant decrease in cardiac output, leading to cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock complicating anterior MI is associated with higher hospital mortality when compared with inferior MI. - **Left ventricular dysfunction:** AWMI involves a significant portion of the left ventricle, which can lead to impaired left ventricular function. This can result in decreased EF, compromised cardiac output, and an increased risk of heart failure. - **Left ventricular mural thrombus** is a frequent complication with systolic dysfunction due to anterior MI. TTE can be used with high accuracy for diagnosis when suspicious of a thrombus. This condition can lead to stroke or peripheral ischemia. - **Ventricular septal rupture** in the ventricular spetum results in communication between the left and right ventricles. This condition requires urgent surgical intervention. - **Free wall rupture** is rare but can lead to cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability. Emergency surgical repair is required. - **Pericardial effusion:** Due to free wall rupture, causing an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. This requires pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage. - **Acute pericarditis:** AWMI can cause inflammation of the pericardium. - **Dressler syndrome:** Delayed autoimmune response following MI, characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and fever. It typically occurs weeks to months after the initial event. - **Sudden cardiac death:** AWMI increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), which can result in sudden cardiac death. - **Conduction abnormalities:** AWMI can lead to conduction abnormalities, including blocks at the level of the His bundle or below and bundle branch blocks."

Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care\nSecondary prevention for acute coronary syndrome includes:\n- Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of further cardiovascular events and improves overall prognosis.\n- Strict blood pressure control helps reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and slows the progression of cardiovascular disease.\n- Achieving and maintaining good glycemic control. The target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level should be below 7% to minimize the risk of diabetic complications and improve long-term outcomes.\n- Aggressive management of dyslipidemia is vital in patients with AWMI. Statin therapy is typically prescribed to achieve target lipid levels, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.\n- Maintaining a healthy body weight. A target body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 is recommended.\n- Participation in a structured cardiac rehabilitation program is highly beneficial for patients with AWMI. Cardiac rehabilitation includes supervised exercise training, education on heart-healthy lifestyle modifications, and psychosocial support. It helps improve functional capacity, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall cardiovascular health."

Cardiac rehabilitation includes supervised exercise training, education on heart-healthy lifestyle modifications, and psychosocial support. It helps improve functional capacity, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. Deterrence and Patient Education\nSeeking emergency medical service as soon as possible is crucial for improving outcomes in anterior myocardial infarction. Therefore, upon arrival, obtaining an ECG is of the utmost importance, and guidelines recommend patients with suspected AMI should receive an ECG within 10 minutes of the first medical encounter. Patients should be well-informed of major PCI or non-PCI cardiac facilities nearby. Additionally, public awareness about the importance of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the availability of automatic external defibrillators can significantly improve survival rates for patients with AMI. Management decisions should be made considering the availability of a PCI facility at the treatment center. Early revascularization, either through PCI or other appropriate interventions, improves outcomes for patients with anterior MI. Timely restoration of blood flow to the affected coronary artery helps preserve heart function, reduce infarct size, and ultimately improve long-term mortality rates. It is important to note that depression is a common comorbidity in patients with AMI. Therefore, healthcare providers should actively screen for and address symptoms of depression in these patients. In addition, appropriate interventions, such as counseling, support groups, or referral to mental health professionals, should be provided to address the psychological well-being of patients with AMI. Integrating strategies at multiple levels, including the individual, the healthcare system, and the population, is essential for enhancing compliance and preventing further cardiovascular events in patients with AWMI. At the individual level, patient education is vital in promoting lifestyle modifications and ensuring adherence to medical treatments, particularly antiplatelet therapy. Educating patients about the importance of weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and diet can significantly improve patient outcomes."

Educating patients about the importance of weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and diet can significantly improve patient outcomes. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nModifying the risk factors remains the cornerstone for reducing the risk of CAD. Therefore, a team approach involving various healthcare professionals is crucial to optimize the management of anterior myocardial infarction (MI). This multidisciplinary team can include primary clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, behavioral therapists, and social workers. By working together, they can assist the patient in effectively addressing and optimizing their risk factors, thereby improving outcomes.\nEarly intervention and optimal medical therapy following reperfusion are essential for patients with anterior MI. Therefore, hospital teams consisting of emergency clinicians, hospitalists, cardiologists, and emergency and intensive care unit (ICU) nurses should collaborate to provide timely intervention and minimize the time from medical contact to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nPost-reperfusion care in the ICU plays a vital role in the recovery process, and patient education immediately after the event is crucial for promoting improved patient compliance with medical recommendations. Referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs is highly recommended, and effective communication with the primary clinician at the time of discharge helps ensure continuity of care and appropriate follow-up after a significant cardiovascular event.\nAdhering to these guidelines and maintaining effective communication among the healthcare team members can significantly contribute to the overall management and long-term outcomes of patients with anterior MI."
