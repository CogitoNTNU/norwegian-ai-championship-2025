    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nChronic pancreatitis is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreatic tissue, resulting in exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Over time, normal pancreatic parenchyma is replaced by fibrotic tissue, causing chronic abdominal pain, malabsorption due to exocrine insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus. As the disease progresses, patients often experience debilitating symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life. Due to its complex pathophysiology and varied clinical manifestations, early recognition and a comprehensive management approach are essential to improving patient outcomes.\nThis continuing education activity provides healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate, diagnose, and manage chronic pancreatitis effectively. Participants gain a deeper understanding of the disease's etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, enabling timely intervention. This activity emphasizes the importance of interprofessional collaboration\u2014engaging specialists in gastroenterology, pain management, endocrinology, nutrition, and rehabilitation\u2014to optimize patient care. By highlighting evidence-based treatment strategies and coordinated management, this activity aims to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals with chronic pancreatitis.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify the early signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis to facilitate timely diagnosis and intervention.\n- Asses patients with chronic pancreatitis for complications such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and pancreatic insufficiency.\n- Implement evidence-based treatment strategies to manage chronic pain and address nutritional deficiencies in patients with chronic pancreatitis.\n- Communicate effectively with patients about lifestyle modifications, including alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, and dietary changes."

Introduction\nThe pancreas is an accessory organ of digestion with dual roles in the endocrine and exocrine systems. This organ plays a crucial role in digesting proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, working alongside bile from the common bile duct. Structurally, the pancreas contains a main pancreatic duct that joins with the common bile duct at the ampulla of Vater, an accessory duct that normally drains into the duodenum at the minor papilla, and smaller branched ducts emerging from the main pancreatic duct. These ducts can become obstructed or genetically malformed. Chronic inflammation can lead to scarring and fibrosis, causing permanent damage that impairs secretory functions. Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease affecting both pancreatic functions. Exocrine dysfunction leads to pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, and weight loss, occurring when over 90% of the organ is damaged. In severe cases, pancreatic insufficiency affects up to 85% of patients. Endocrine dysfunction results in pancreatogenic diabetes, also known as type 3c diabetes. In 2016, international pancreas societies adopted a mechanistic definition of chronic pancreatitis. This definition characterizes end-stage chronic pancreatitis as pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia, but also addresses the disease mechanism as a pathological fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. Chronic pancreatitis differs from acute pancreatitis, which presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain radiating to the back. Patients with chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic for long periods or may experience persistent abdominal pain requiring hospitalization."

    "text": "Chronic pancreatitis differs from acute pancreatitis, which presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain radiating to the back. Patients with chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic for long periods or may experience persistent abdominal pain requiring hospitalization. Pathophysiology\nThe pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis appears to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Studies have identified pancreatitis susceptibility genes associated with loss of function. Two main theories explain the development of chronic pancreatic disease. The first theory suggests that impaired bicarbonate secretion fails to counterbalance increased pancreatic protein secretion. As a result, excess proteins form plugs within the lobules and ducts, leading to calcification and stone formation. The second theory involves the intraparenchymal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas, potentially triggered by genetic predisposition or external influences such as alcohol consumption. Recent research suggests that alcohol diminishes the cell's ability to respond to calcium signaling. This reduced response disrupts the feedback mechanism and initiates a cycle of cellular damage, leading to cell death. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, characterized by steatorrhea and azotorrhea, becomes clinically evident after over 90% of pancreatic function is lost. This condition typically manifests at least 5 years after the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis. Although the first and second episodes rarely lead to chronic disease, the likelihood rises from 16% to 50% after the third or fourth episode. A proposed explanation is that alcoholic pancreatitis is more likely to recur than biliary pancreatitis, which typically occurs only once. Continued alcohol consumption contributes to progressive pancreatic damage. In addition, each recurrent episode causes further injury to an already compromised pancreas. By the third episode and beyond, acute pancreatitis tends to be more severe than the initial occurrences. Individuals with 3 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis often exhibit clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis. A conceptual model outlining the progression of chronic pancreatitis has been published."

Individuals with 3 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis often exhibit clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis. A conceptual model outlining the progression of chronic pancreatitis has been published. Evaluation\nWhen chronic pancreatitis is suspected, the new mechanistic definition can aid in diagnosis. This approach integrates clinical features (typical signs, symptoms, and family history) with risk factors (see **Table. ** Modified TIGAR-O Pancreatitis Risk/Etiology Checklist). Biomarkers further support the diagnosis and may include the following:\n- Serum markers\n- Amylase\n- Lipase\n- Glucose\n- IgG4\n- Triglycerides\n- Tumor markers\n- Nutritional deficiencies\n- Hypovitaminosis A, D, K, and B12\n- Additional tests\n- Sweat chloride levels\n- Pancreatic biopsies\nThe 72-hour quantitative fecal fat collection is the most definitive test for advanced pancreatic insufficiency to evaluate steatorrhea. A fecal fat excretion of greater than 7 g/d confirms the diagnosis. Alternatively, a fecal elastase-1 level can be performed using a single random stool sample to assess pancreatic insufficiency. - Normal fecal elastase level: > 500 \u03bcg/g of stool\n- Borderline range: 200 to 500 \u03bcg/g (nonspecific, may be normal)\n- Moderate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: 100 to 200 \u03bcg/g\n- Severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: \\<100 \u03bcg/g\nAlthough neither test is highly accurate, fecal elastase testing is less reliable than the 72-hour fecal fat collection but is more practical and widely used in clinical practice. For patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis-related pain, and signs of maldigestion, such as steatorrhea or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, confirmatory imaging with CT or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography testing (MRCP) should be the initial diagnostic step. **Diagnostic Algorithm**\n- MRCP and CT are the preferred imaging modalities. - Detect calcifications (hallmark sign), pancreatic enlargement, and ductal obstruction or dilation."

Treatment / Management\nThe primary goals of treatment are managing pain and improving malabsorption. Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis arises from inflammation, neuropathic mechanisms, and ductal obstruction. Once established, chronic pain is typically persistent and lifelong without intervention and can be debilitating. One of the most critical steps in management is encouraging alcohol cessation, as continued alcohol use can exacerbate pain and accelerate disease progression. Similarly, smoking cessation is vital and essential, as smoking is known to worsen the condition over time. Intervention is not clearly indicated when ductal strictures or stones are present, but the patient remains asymptomatic. However, if these obstructions cause symptoms, therapeutic options such as endoscopic procedures, surgical intervention, or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may be considered. **Pain Management of Chronic Pancreatitis**\nPain management in chronic pancreatitis involves medical, endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical interventions. When imaging reveals ductal obstruction due to strictures or stones, the initial treatment approach should include endoscopy therapy or, in the case of stones, ESWL. Surgical intervention may be necessary if these interventions are unsuccessful or technically unfeasible. However, if no obstruction is identified, a trial of medical therapy is the recommended first-line approach. **Medical management:** The initial approach to pain management in chronic pancreatitis should prioritize non-opioid medications before considering opioids. First-line options include acetaminophen or paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregabalin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants. Opioids should be avoided whenever possible due to the risks of dependence or addiction, tolerance, and adverse effects. However, they may be considered when non-opioid treatments prove ineffective or inadequate."

However, they may be considered when non-opioid treatments prove ineffective or inadequate. Opioids should be prescribed in combination with non-opioid agents, particularly gabapentin, and initiated with a milder opioid such as tramadol, which has fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be more effective when combined with pregabalin. Antioxidant combinations\u2014including selenium, ascorbic acid, \u03b2-carotene, L-methionine, and sometimes \u03b1-tocopherol\u2014have demonstrated some effectiveness in pain relief in early chronic pancreatitis based on small studies. However, variability in formulations and dosages across studies limits definitive conclusions. Despite this, antioxidant therapy is safe and remains an option for some patients. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation, although expensive, has not been proven effective in relieving pain associated with chronic pancreatitis. However, it may still be beneficial for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to improve nutrient absorption and digestion\n**Endoscopic management:** A celiac plexus block, involving the injection of a local anesthetic (typically bupivacaine), sometimes combined with a corticosteroid (typically triamcinolone), can be performed endoscopically using EUS or with CT guidance by a radiologist. Pain relief from this procedure typically lasts 3 to 6 months and can be repeated as needed. Obstructing pancreatic stones can be extracted using a basket, whereas balloons are rarely effective except in children, who may have softer stones. If traditional extraction methods fail, ESWL, pancreatoscopy-assisted laser, or electrohydraulic lithotripsy may be considered, particularly when a guidewire cannot be advanced past the stone(s). For main pancreatic duct dilation, ERCP can help decompress ductal obstruction through pancreatic sphincterotomy, stone extraction, stricture dilatation, or stent placement, depending on diagnostic pancreatographic findings. However, when chronic pancreatitis is advanced enough to cause steatorrhea, ductal decompression via dilatation, stenting, or stone extraction offers limited benefit. During ERCP, ductal cytologic brushing can also be performed to evaluate for malignancy. Pancreatic duct leaks may be treated with the temporary placement of a plastic stent to facilitate healing."

Endoscopic drainage into the gastrointestinal tract, typically the stomach, can be performed using 1 or more lumen-apposing metal stents for peri-gastric pancreatic fluid collections such as pseudocysts or necrosis. **Surgical management:** Surgical decompression is preferred over ERCP when the main pancreatic duct is narrowed. Several surgical procedures are available based on the disease's location and severity:\n- Puestow procedure (most commonly performed): Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy combined with a Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy to improve drainage. - Beger procedure: Duodenal-preserving pancreatic head resection with a Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy, used for pancreatic head-dominant chronic pancreatitis. - Frey procedure: A modification of the Puestow procedure that involves lateral pancreaticojejunostomy draining the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Unlike the Beger procedure, it preserves the pancreatic neck while removing part of the overlying pancreatic head. - Distal pancreatectomy: Typically performed laparoscopically for tail-predominant disease. However, complications such as pancreatic fistulae and endocrine failure are relatively common. - Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant: Reserved for patients with refractory pain who have failed all other treatments. Although once used selectively, its application has been increasing in recent years. Additional surgical indications for chronic pancreatitis include:\n- Pancreatic abscess, fistula, or pseudocyst when endoscopic management fails\n- Pancreatic ascites\n- Stenosis of the duodenum leading to gastric outlet obstruction\n- Gastric variceal bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis when conservative therapy is ineffective\nIn severe cases, inpatient care may be necessary, particularly for patients with chronic pain and anorexia, often requiring narcotics and nutritional support. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation, typically taken with meals, may help reduce pain, although its effectiveness remains uncertain. **Management of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency**\nChronic pancreatitis accompanied by weight loss, malnutrition, diarrhea, steatorrhea, osteopenia, or osteoporosis should raise suspicion of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is recommended for managing symptomatic exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The potential benefits of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy include improved symptoms, reduced morbidity related to maldigestion (especially bone fractures), better absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and trace elements, reduced fecal fat, weight gain, improved quality of life, and potentially lower mortality rates. A reduced fecal elastase level is the accessible diagnostic test for moderate-to-severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Patients should avoid consuming a high-fiber diet (>25 g/d), as excessive fiber may interfere with enzyme activity. However, a low-fat diet is no longer recommended, as it may contribute to nutritional deficiencies. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be taken at the start of each meal or snack, with additional supplementation added during or after the meal if needed (see **Table 3. ** Dosage of Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy). Failure to respond to maximal doses of PERT raises several considerations. To maintain effectiveness, capsules must be appropriately stored at temperatures below 25 \u00b0C or 77 \u00b0F and kept away from direct sunlight, cars, or heat sources. In addition, inadequate response may indicate the need for acid suppression therapy with a histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor.

Patients with this condition often experience a wide range of complications, including chronic pain, frequent hospital admissions, and progressive pancreatic dysfunction. Given the complexity of the disease, management typically involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.\nTo reduce morbidity and mortality, treatment focuses on behavior modification. Educating patients about the adverse effects of alcohol and tobacco is crucial, as continued alcohol consumption significantly worsens outcomes. Abstaining from alcohol not only improves overall health but can also provide pain relief in the early stages of the disease. Notably, patients who continue to drink alcohol have a mortality rate 3 times higher than those who abstain.\nPancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is essential for individuals with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to maintain adequate nutrition. Pharmacists play a key role in selecting the most appropriate enzyme formulations. In addition, patients should be referred to an alcohol and chemical dependency program to support long-term abstinence.\nChronic pain management is another critical aspect of care. Many patients frequently seek narcotics, necessitating referral to a pain specialist for appropriate treatment strategies. The primary care provider should monitor these patients regularly, assessing for steatorrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. A dietitian should educate patients on the importance of proper nutrition, including supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins and calcium when needed.\nOngoing reassessment and monitoring are essential to ensure patients remain alcohol-free and receive appropriate medical care. A team-based approach\u2014including primary care providers, gastroenterologists, pain specialists, pharmacists, dieticians, and mental health professionals\u2014is the most effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with chronic pancreatitis."

    "text": "Introduction\nAcute pancreatitis is a common disease and is the leading cause of hospitalization among gastrointestinal disorders in the United States. It involves the acute inflammation of the pancreas. The severity of acute pancreatitis varies widely, from mild conditions needing conservative treatment to severe and complicated diseases with high morbidity and mortality. The mortality of acute pancreas ranges from 3% in patients with mild edematous pancreatitis to as high as 20% in patients with pancreatic necrosis. The diagnosis of acute presentation is simple, but the major challenge is predicting the progression of the disease course and outcome. The duration of the disease is essential in determining the level of care. The Atlanta classification broadly classifies acute pancreatitis into 2 categories:\n- Interstitial edematous acute pancreatitis is characterized by the acute inflammation of the pancreatic parenchyma and surrounding peri-pancreatic tissue. - Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is characterized by necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma and peri-pancreatic tissue. Based on the severity of the disease, acute pancreatitis is divided into the following types;\n- In mild acute pancreatitis, local or systemic complications and organ failure are absent. - In moderately severe acute pancreatitis, there are local complications with or without organic failure for less than 48 hours. - In severe acute pancreatitis, there is persistent organ failure for more than 48 hours with the involvement of 1 or more than 1 organ. The pancreas is a digestive gland organ found in front of vertebrae L1 and L2 bodies on the posterior abdominal wall. The pancreas lies transversely between the duodenum on the right and the spleen on the left. It is divided into 4 parts: the head, neck, body, and tail. The head of the pancreas lies on the inferior vena cava and the right renal vein and is surrounded by the loop of the duodenum. The tail of the pancreas extends up to the splenic hilum."

Etiology\nThe most common causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia (see **Image.** Acute Pancreatitis, Gallstones). The occurrence rate of each acute pancreatitis etiology varies across geographic regions and socioeconomic strata. Common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are listed below.\n- Gallstones\n- Alcohol use\n- Hypertriglyceridemia\n- Drug-induced pancreatitis\n- Idiopathic\n- Post-procedural, eg, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or abdominal surgery\n- Ampullary stenosis, which is formerly known as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type I\n- Autoimmune pancreatitis, type I (systemic IgG4 disease-related), and type II\n- Viral infections like Coxsackie, Cytomegalovirus, Echovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis A/B/C, HIV, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella\n- Bacterial infections like _Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella, Leptospirosis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycoplasma_\n- Smoking\n- Trauma\n- Congenital anomalies, eg, annular pancreas\n- Genetic disorders like hereditary pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency\n- Hypercalcemia\n- Parasitic infections _(Ascaris lumbricoides, Cryptosporidium, Clonorchis Sinensis, Microsporidia_)\n- Renal disease (Hemodialysis)\n- Toxins (Scorpion bites, organophosphate poisoning)\n- Vasculitis (Polyarteritis nodosa, Systemic lupus erythematosus)\nThe causes of acute pancreatitis can be summarized into the following categories in the table below.

[Table Icon](/books/NBK482468/table/article-26578.table0/?report=objectonly \"Table\") Pathophysiology\nThe localized destruction characterizes the pathophysiology of pancreatitis in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response. The major inciting event is the premature activation of the enzyme trypsinogen to trypsin within the acinar cell instead of the duct lumen. The leading cause is an elevation in ductal pressures (such as duct obstruction) and problems with calcium homeostasis and pH. Many toxins responsible for causing pancreatitis cause ATP depletion, increasing the intra-acinar calcium concentrations that may stimulate the early activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, activating enzymes such as elastase and phospholipases.\nThis premature activation of these zymogens causes extensive tissue damage and Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) release. This release of DAMPs is associated with recruiting neutrophils and initiating the inflammatory cascade. This inflammatory cascade then leads to the systemic manifestations of acute pancreatitis. It ultimately produces capillary permeability and endothelium damage with microvascular thrombosis that gives rise to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) as the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the setting of acute pancreatitis.\nSome individuals also have a genetic predisposition for pancreatitis and suffer from recurrent acute pancreatitis, progressing to chronic pancreatitis. Not surprisingly, the associated genes are involved in activating trypsinogen to trypsin. Many genes play a role in recurrent pancreatitis, eg, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (_CFTR_) gene, cationic trypsinogen gene (_PRSS1_) gain of function mutations, mutations of trypsin degrading enzyme (CTCR) chymotrypsin C and (SPINK1) pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. Furthermore, they are also involved in the increasingly acknowledged spectrum of diseases, from acute to chronic pancreatitis."

History and Physical\nThe patient commonly describes moderate to severe abdominal pain in the epigastrium associated with nausea and anorexia. The nature of the pain can vary, depending on whether the etiology is a biliary obstruction or a metabolic/toxicologic cause. Biliary etiology is often described as a sharper pain that radiates to the back with a more acute onset. In contrast, metabolic and toxicologic causes like alcohol often have a more sluggish start with dull and generalized pain in the epigastrium. A detailed history regarding alcohol use and medications should be inquired about, keeping in mind that it takes over 5 years of heavy alcohol use to induce alcohol-related pancreatitis. Smoking history is also a significant risk factor for acute pancreatitis.\nFamily history should be reviewed, mainly when more common etiologies appear less likely, as there are rare genetic cases of familial pancreatitis. A physical exam is often significant for fever, tachycardia, and in severe patients, hypotension.

Evaluation\nAccording to the Revised Atlanta Classification, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires meeting at least 2 of 3 criteria:\n1. A lipase or amylase level is 3 times the normal's upper limit. 1. Abdominal pain is consistent with pancreatitis. 1. Abdominal imaging is consistent with acute pancreatitis. Establishing the underlying etiology of acute pancreatitis includes initial evaluation followed by laboratory evaluation. The critical element of the first assessment of suspected acute pancreatitis involves a detailed history, which includes symptoms of gallstone disease or evidence of gallstone disease on imaging, unexplained weight loss or new onset of diabetes, history of alcohol abuse, medication use, prior surgical procedure or trauma, history of hypertriglyceridemia or hypercalcemia, history of autoimmune disease or family history of recurrent acute pancreatitis. See **Image. ** Acute Pancreatitis, Signs and Symptoms. Laboratory evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis should include routine tests, eg, serum triglyceride, serum calcium, liver biochemical tests, additional genetic testing in patients with strong family history, and imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound for assessment of choledocholithiasis and bile duct dilatation. A chest radiograph is usually obtained in moderate to severe cases to evaluate for pleural effusions, indicating the higher severity of the disease with higher mortality. In some instances where the diagnosis is equivocal, but pancreatitis is still suspected, performing computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast is recommended to establish or rule out the diagnosis. CT is also performed in cases where the patient has failed to improve or worsen despite adequate fluid resuscitation over 48 hours to determine the presence of necrosis (see **Image. ** Peripancreatic Necrotic Fluid Shown on CT)."

The fluid resuscitation monitoring is done with a combination of labs, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, and urine output every 4 to 6 hours in the first 24 hours of resuscitation to adjust the fluid rate. No response to initial resuscitation indicates a high likelihood of ensuing MODS and is grounds for upgrading the level of care. A recent RCT concluded that aggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis resulted in a higher incidence of fluid overload without any clinical improvement in the outcomes. Another critical issue in managing acute pancreatitis is nutrition. The commonly employed practice is to keep nothing by mouth until abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and ileus improve. Many studies support early feeding in mild pancreatitis and consider it safe as it does not exacerbate symptoms. A soft, low-residue, low-fat diet is recommended for initial feeding. Later it is advanced to regular consistency as soon as it is tolerated. In severe pancreatitis or where per-oral intake is not tolerable, nasojejunal feeding is considered superior to parenteral nutrition because it helps minimize bacterial translocation by maintaining the intestinal wall barrier. Prophylactic antibiotics are usually not needed. With the suspicion of an infection, empiric antibiotics are appropriate until culture results are available. Initiation of antibiotics is limited to the presence of infected necrosis."

Still, a recent Cochrane review of 5 RCTs with a total of 227 patients shows no difference between opioids and other analgesic options regarding the risk of complications or clinically severe adverse events. Also, a meta-analysis by Stigliano et al concluded there was no credible evidence to avoid using morphine for pain management in acute pancreatitis. Further management is directed at the etiology of pancreatitis. In gallstone pancreatitis, there is a strong recommendation for early cholecystectomy. Early ERCP is beneficial in cases of concurrent cholangitis and blatant biliary obstruction within 24 hours of presentation. ERCP is reserved for a distal biliary filling defect on intraoperative cholangiogram during cholecystectomy in mild or spontaneously resolving biliary pancreatitis cases. In hypertriglyceridemia, specific treatment aims to reduce triglyceride levels to less than 500 mg/dL. This goal is achieved by apheresis and insulin drip with or without glucose. Local complications of acute pancreatitis include early (less than 4 weeks, peripancreatic fluid collection, and pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis) and late (more than 4 weeks, pancreatic pseudocyst, and walled-off necrosis). Usually, acute peripancreatic fluid collection resolves spontaneously in most cases, and only less than 10% results in pancreatic pseudocyst. Most pseudocysts decide to do observation alone with periodic follow-up using CT or MRI (see **Image. ** Necrotising Pancreatitis With Extensive Peripancreatic Nodularity). Drainage of these pseudocysts is only recommended in case of infection and rapid enlargement. The drainage modalities include endoscopic (transmural or transpupillary) or percutaneous, the endoscopic approach being the preferred modality. Necrotic collection management remains challenging."

Differential Diagnosis\nThe overall differential for abdominal pain constitutes the differential for acute pancreatitis. It can be significantly narrowed down to a specific diagnosis with a good history and physical examination described above. Differential diagnoses for acute pancreatitis include but are not limited to the following:\n- Peptic ulcer disease\n- Cholangitis\n- Cholecystitis\n- Bowel obstruction\n- Bowel perforation\n- Mesenteric ischemia\n- Acute hepatitis\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis\n- Basilar pneumonia\n- Myocardial infarction\n- Aortic dissection\n- Renal colic\nIn many cases of abdominal pain, a lipase level 3 times the upper limit of normal allows for the diagnosis of pancreatitis as the source of abdominal pain due to its high specificity. An abdominal ultrasound helps to differentiate cholecystitis, whereas high suspicion of mesenteric ischemia warrants a CT angiogram. In high-risk patients, the cardiac source should be concurrently ruled out as it can present atypical epigastric pain. Though the pain of a progressing aortic dissection is more severe and tearing in nature, it should be considered due to its particularly urgent nature."

Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials\nA recent randomized control trial (RCT), published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted at 18 centers in which patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were randomly assigned to either goal-directed aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution. The aggressive fluid resuscitation was done with a bolus of 20ml/kg of body weight, followed by maintenance fluid of 3ml/kg/hour. The moderate fluid resuscitation group consisted of a 10 ml/kg of body weight bolus in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus if normovolemia, followed by 1.5 ml/kg/hour as maintenance fluid. The patient's assessment was done at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours with an adjustment of fluid resuscitation according to the patient's clinical status.\nThe trial's primary outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis in hospitalized patients. The primary safety outcome among these patients was fluid overload. The interim analysis included a total of 249 patients, and the trial was halted due to between-group differences in the safety outcomes. The incidence of fluid overload was 20.05% in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation and 3% in the moderate resuscitation group(adjusted relative risk, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.36 to 5.94, P = 0.004). The trial concluded with the development of a higher incidence of fluid overload in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation without improvement in clinical outcomes."

Prognosis\nThe overall mortality of acute pancreatitis is approximately 1 to 2%; however, severe acute pancreatitis carries a much higher but undetermined mortality rate. Severity assessment and prognostication are essential to determine the level of care. Multiple clinical prediction scales developed and validated are cumbersome to calculate and need 48-hour data. The International Association of Pancreatology and American Pancreatic Association guidelines states that developing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at admission and persistent for 48 hours predict severe acute pancreatitis. A persistent SIRS is associated with a mortality of 25% when compared with 8% for a transient SIRS. However, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality with persistent SIRS are 77-89% and 79-86%, respectively, and that of SIRS at admission is 100% and 31%, respectively. Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) is a relatively recent addition to this list. This index has good predictive performance for both severe acute pancreatitis and mortality and has been validated prospectively, and it is simple and easy to calculate from initial presentation data. Compared with other scoring systems like Ranson criteria and APACHE II score, the BISAP score outperforms in specificity but has a suboptimal sensitivity for mortality and SAP. BISAP score - 0-2 points indicates lower mortality of less than 2%, and 3-5 points indicate higher mortality more significant than 15%.\n![Table Icon](/books/NBK482468/table/article-26578.table3/?report=objectonly \"Table\")"

[Table Icon](/books/NBK482468/table/article-26578.table3/?report=objectonly \"Table\") Pearls and Other Issues\nThe pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is based on the premature activation of the enzymes zymogen and trypsinogen, resulting in local pancreatic destruction and activation of the inflammatory cascade, which causes the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) often associated with acute pancreatitis. Systemic inflammation can lead to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Revised Atlanta Criteria defines the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, which states that acute pancreatitis requires at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: 1) lipase or amylase levels 3 times the upper limit of normal, 2) physical exam consistent with pancreatitis, and 3) imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound) findings that are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The Bedside Index Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score can aid in triaging patients for the level of care. This index has good predictive performance for both severe acute pancreatitis and mortality and has been validated prospectively, and it is simple and easy to calculate from initial presentation data. The essential stage of management of acute pancreatitis is the first 12 to 24 hours of admission. During this time, appropriate fluid resuscitation can significantly reduce complications and mortality. Close observation of vitals and basic labs are essential to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation. The incidence of idiopathic pancreatitis remains as high as 10 to 20% of acute pancreatitis cases and causes a particular diagnostic and management dilemma. Recent studies continue to address the best use of EUS and ERCP in evaluating these cases with a more tempered approach to ERCP due to its relatively high rate of inducing post-procedural pancreatitis."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAcute pancreatitis is a severe disorder. The most effective way to manage the condition is with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including a surgeon, radiologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, intensivist, gastroenterologist, pharmacist, nurse, and addiction specialist. The 3 major causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcohol, and medications. The emphasis should be on prevention. The nurse and pharmacist are in the prime position to educate the patient on lowering their risks of acute pancreatitis by abstaining from alcohol, losing weight, eating a low-fat diet, and reducing their lipid profile. In addition, the pharmacist can re-evaluate all the medications and recommend discontinuing those associated with pancreatitis. It is incumbent on all team members to exercise open communication with the rest of the team and to keep meticulous records of every interaction or intervention with the patient so that everyone involved in care can access the same accurate, updated patient data. This interprofessional approach yields the best possible patient results.\n**Outcomes**\nAcute pancreatitis is a severe disorder that still carries a mortality of 5 to 15%, depending on the cause, patient age, and comorbidity. Patients with gallstone pancreatitis generally have higher mortality than those with alcoholic pancreatitis. In addition, the presence of type 2 diabetes significantly increases the risk of complications and death. In patients with multiorgan involvement, the mortality can be as high as 20%. Most deaths are due to multiorgan failure and hypotensive shock. Various classifications have been developed to assess the prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis, but most are cumbersome for practical use."
