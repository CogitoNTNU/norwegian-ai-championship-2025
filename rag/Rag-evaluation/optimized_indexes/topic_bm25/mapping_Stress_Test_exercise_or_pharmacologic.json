    "text": "Introduction\nTreadmill stress testing is a form of cardiovascular stress testing that uses exercise with electrocardiography (ECG) and blood pressure monitoring. This form of stress testing is usually performed with exercise protocols using either a treadmill or bicycle. In addition, patients who are unable to exercise may benefit from the administration of a pharmacologic agent that stimulates the heart's activity, simulating exercise-induced changes. With treadmill stress testing, providers can determine a patient's functional capacity, assess the probability and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), and assess the risks, prognosis, and effects of therapy. Observations from the Henry Ford exercise testing (FIT) study appear to suggest a graded and inverse correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness and incidental atrial fibrillation, especially for obese patients. **Exercise Physiology**\nExercise is associated with sympathetic stimulation and changes in the coronary vasomotor tone, which affects coronary blood flow. Several studies have reported that the coronaries dilate during exercise. Some reported mechanisms contributing to this dilatation include the release of vasoactive substances from the endothelium due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption, passive relaxation due to the increase in coronary arterial pressure, and endothelium-mediated limitation of constrictor effects of catecholamine. During exercise, the increase in myocardial oxygen demand and coronary vasodilation allows for increased oxygen delivery which is crucial to myocardial perfusion, thereby preventing ischemia. Through this hyperemic effect, providers can identify ischemia, as stenotic vessels do not vasodilate as well as normal vessels. Due to sympathetic stimulation and vagal inhibition, an increase in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output is noted. Alveolar ventilation and venous return also increase as a consequence of selective vasoconstriction. The hemodynamic response depends on the amount of muscle mass involved, exercise intensity, and overall conditioning. As exercise progresses, skeletal muscle blood flow increase and peripheral resistance decrease leading to a rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure."

As exercise progresses, skeletal muscle blood flow increase and peripheral resistance decrease leading to a rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure. Technique or Treatment\nTreadmill stress testing is performed in a designated lab, supervised by a trained healthcare provider. Electrodes are placed on the chest and attached to an ECG machine, recording the heart's electrical activity. The resting ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure are obtained prior to starting the exercise regimen. The baseline ECG should be evaluated closely prior to starting the exercise portion of the test. Several baseline ECG changes can obscure the test results, making it difficult for the provider to interpret the results in terms of ischemia. Such baseline changes include ST-segment changes that are greater than or equal to 1 mm, left bundle branch block, ventricular paced rhythm, left ventricular or right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular pre-excitation (i.e., WPW syndrome), T wave inversions due to strain pattern or previous injury, conduction abnormalities, and medication-induced ST-T wave changes. If any of these ECG abnormalities are noted, the test should be performed with the addition of an imaging modality. The resting ECG is usually obtained both supine and standing since patient position can influence the QRS and T wave axes. Whether with imaging or without, treadmill stress testing is more helpful in excluding CAD than confirming it. Once it is determined that there are no limiting factors based on baseline ECG, the patient is placed on a treadmill with a designed protocol that increases in intervals as they exercise. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored throughout exercise, and the patient is monitored for any developing symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or extreme fatigue. The Bruce protocol is the most common one used during treadmill exercise stress testing."

The Bruce protocol is the most common one used during treadmill exercise stress testing. This protocol is divided into successive 3-minute stages, each requiring the patient to walk faster and at a steeper grade. The testing protocol could be adjusted to a patient's tolerance, aiming for 6 to 12 minutes of exercise duration. There is a modified Bruce protocol for those who cannot exercise vigorously, adding two lower workload stages to the beginning of the standard Bruce protocol, both of which require less effort than stage 1. There are a number of other protocols for patients with a limited exercise tolerance; however, other methods that do not include exercise are also available for such patients. During the exercise test, data about heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG changes should be obtained at the end of each stage. At any time, an abnormality is detected with cardiac monitoring. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure should rise with each stage of exercise until a peak is achieved. Patients should be questioned about any symptoms they experience during exercise. All patients should be monitored closely during recovery until heart rate and ECG are back to baseline, as arrhythmias and ECG changes can still develop. It is unnecessary to stop exercise at the onset of mild symptoms if no abnormalities are noted on ECG and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines have specified indications for the termination of exercise testing. The following are the absolute indications for termination of testing:\n- A drop in systolic blood pressure of greater than 10 mmHg from baseline when accompanied by other indications of ischemia."

There should be no ECG changes suggestive of ischemia and no arrhythmias during testing. Failure of the blood pressure to increase or decrease with signs of ischemia has prognostic significance. Angina or significant ST depression (greater than 2 mm) before completing stage 2 of the Bruce protocol and/or ST depressions that persist for more than 5 minutes into recovery suggest severe ischemia and high risk for coronary events. Exercise testing will either be positive, negative, equivocal, or uninterpretable if there is a limiting factor such as heart rate. A Duke treadmill score (DTS) is a validated scoring system that can assist with the risk assessment of a patient who has undergone an exercise stress test. The DTS was developed to provide accurate diagnostic and prognostic information for evaluating patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The DTS uses three parameters: exercise time, ST-segment deviation (depression or elevation), and exertional angina to determine if patients are at a low, intermediate, or high risk for ischemic heart disease. The typical range is from +15 to -25. If a patient's score is greater than or equal to 5, they are considered low risk, while those who score less than or equal to -11 are considered high risk. This scoring system predicts 5-year mortality, where low-risk scores have a 5-year survival of 97%, intermediate-risk scores have a 5-year survival of 90%, and high-risk scores indicate a 5-year survival of about 65%. Patients with an intermediate risk assessment should generally be referred for additional risk stratification with an imaging modality."

Complications\nA treadmill stress test is generally considered safe, and its complications are rare. However, the following are the possible complications of a treadmill stress test:\n- Hypotension can happen during or immediately after exercise, potentially causing the patient to feel dizzy. The problem generally goes away after stopping exercise.\n- Arrhythmias that occur during treadmill stress testing generally stop soon after the termination of the test.\n- Although very rare, treadmill stress testing could possibly cause a myocardial infarction.\nPatients should be instructed not to eat, drink, or smoke for at least three hours before the examination, as this maximizes exercise capacity. The patient should bring comfortable exercise clothing and walking shoes to the testing facility. The healthcare professional performing the test should explain the benefits, risks, and possible complications to the patient before testing.\nMedications should be discussed with the patient beforehand, as some drugs such as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, and anti-arrhythmic medications can affect the maximal heart rate achieved. An ischemic response can also be affected if patients are taking nitrates. A thorough history and physical examination should be performed on all patients before referral for exercise stress testing."

A thorough history and physical examination should be performed on all patients before referral for exercise stress testing. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nWhen patients with atypical chest pain or new-onset heart failure present to the primary care provider, internist, and nurse practitioner, one of the investigations to assess the heart is a treadmill test. The test is usually performed by a cardiologist. It is helpful as a part of diagnosing patients with known or suspected coronary disease and provides significant prognostic information for patients with known disease.\nCurrent guidelines suggest that exercise tests with imaging or echocardiography can be used as follow-up tests in intermediate or high-risk patients. If follow-up testing is positive, patients may benefit from guideline-directed medical therapy versus cardiac catheterization with revascularization. The healthcare providers should educate the patient on what the exercise stress test involves, how it is performed, and the type of results it can reproduce.\nTreadmill stress testing requires the coordinated efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes cardiologists, family clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), and nurses. All team members must know the parameters of stress testing, contraindications, interpretation, and signs that the test may need to be terminated earlier. Any concerns noted by any team member should be documented in the patient's health record and communicated to other interprofessional team members. Proper cardiac stress testing can prevent more serious cardiac events by helping initiate therapeutic interventions earlier and optimize patient outcomes. The interprofessional paradigm is the best means by which to accomplish this."

    "text": "Introduction\nCardiac stress testing is the most commonly used modality for diagnostic purposes in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The utility of stress testing should be interpreted based on the likelihood of the disease. Patients with a low probability of disease have a high risk of false-positive results and may end up further unnecessary invasive testing without changing patient outcomes. Those with high pretest probability have a high risk of false-negative results that can miss a critical diagnosis; therefore, these patients should proceed directly to more confirmatory testing such as cardiac catheterization. Stress testing is most clinically useful in intermediate-risk patients for CAD that will help further reclassify these patients into low risk and high-risk depending on the stress test result. Stress testing can also be used to obtain prognostic information to determine the patient's response to optical medical therapy, measure exercise capacity, evaluate ischemia who are already started on medical therapy for known CAD. In general exercise, stress is preferred because it provides a gauge of functional capacity, exercise tolerance, and symptom provocation. Pharmacologic stress testing is an alternative modality in patients who are unable to exercise and with the following conditions:\n1. Patients presenting with unstable angina. 1. History of heart failure which is not well controlled, and there is a concern for deterioration. 1. Poorly controlled blood pressure with systolic blood pressure significantly higher (>200 mmHg at rest). 1. Patients with a history of aortic stenosis which is significantly worse on echocardiogram (aortic valve area \\<1.0 cm2 and mean gradient >40 mmHg) and have ongoing symptoms. 1.

However, it can be used in patients who have contraindications to pharmacologic vasodilator stress agents such as in patients who have severe respiratory diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or when regadenoson is not readily available for these patients. Potential Diagnosis\n**Medications used for stress testing diagnosis include all of the following. **\n**Adenosine**\nAdenosine acts on the coronary arteries through specific activation of the A2A receptor and causes them to dilate. There are 4 types of adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. - Activation of the A1 receptor results in decreased atrioventricular conduction and reduces heart rate. - Activation of A2A receptors in vascular smooth muscles in blood vessels such as in coronary arteries causing vasodilation\n- Activation of the A2B and A3 receptors in bronchial beds can also result in bronchospasm. Dose:\nThe dose of adenosine used during a pharmacologic stress testing is 140 mcg/kg/min, and it is given continuously for 6 minutes duration. The radioactive material is normally given at 3 minutes, and then adenosine is kept infusing for 3 more minutes. There is an additional methodology in which adenosine is given for 4 minutes as a continuous infusion, and its effects and outcomes are comparable to the continuous infusion lasting for 6 minutes. Adenosine generally produces a modest increase in heart rate and a modest decrease in blood pressure. The infusion results in a 3.5- to 4-fold increase in coronary blood flow over baseline. The half-life of adenosine is less than 10 seconds. Limiting caffeine intake:\nMethylxanthines such as theophylline or caffeine, block adenosine binding due to antagonistic action at A2A receptors and can reduce the coronary vasodilation effects of adenosine. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue consumption of caffeine-containing medications, foods, or beverages for at least 12 hours and ideally 24 hours before adenosine stress testing. Contraindications:\n1."

Contraindications:\n1. Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with reactive airway disease with significant wheezing\n1. Patients with a history of advanced conduction abnormalities, including 2nd or 3rd-degree atrioventricular block in the absence of a permanent pacemaker. 1. Patients with a history of abnormalities in the sinus node in the absence of a permanent pacemaker\n1. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg\n1. Poorly controlled blood pressure with systolic blood pressure significantly higher (over 200 mmHg at rest). 1. Caffeine intake in the previous 12 hours\n1. Known hypersensitivity to adenosine\n1. Patients with acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina or who experienced a myocardial infarction less than 1 week ago. **Dipyridamole**\nDipyridamole was the first vasodilator used for myocardial perfusion stress testing. It is an indirect coronary artery vasodilator. It increases the tissue levels of adenosine by preventing the intracellular reuptake of adenosine by inhibiting enzyme adenosine deaminase prolonging its vasodilator effect and increasing adenosine blood levels. Dipyridamole increases coronary blood flow to 3.8 to 7 times than baseline. The alpha half-life (the initial decline following peak concentration) is approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The beta-half life (the terminal decline in plasma concentration) is approximately 10 hours. It is metabolized in the liver to glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted in the bile. Dipyridamole dose:\nThe dose of dipyridamole is 0.142 mcg/kg/min, or 0.57 mcg/kg. Dipyridamole is infused over 4 min, with the radiotracer being injected 3 to 5 min after the completion of the dipyridamole infusion. Symptoms may last for a longer time than other vasodilators (15 to 25 minutes). Side effects of dipyridamole:\n1. The incidence of atrioventricular (AV) block with dipyridamole is less than that observed with adenosine (2%). 1. Chest pain is seen in 20% but is nonspecific and not necessarily indicative of the presence of CAD. 1. Minor side effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, hypotension, and flushing. Contraindications:\n1."

Known hypersensitivity to dipyridamole. 1. Caffeine intake in the previous 12 hours\n1. Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block without a functioning pacemaker. **Regadenoson**\nRegadenoson is another direct coronary artery vasodilator, which is a selective A2A agonist. The affinity with which regadenoson binds with A2A is 10 times greater than its affinity to bind with the A1 receptor and even weaker affinity to bind with A2B and A3 receptors. Regadenoson produces maximal hyperemia quickly and maintains it for an optimal duration that is more practical for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Regadenoson's simple, rapid bolus administration in all patients, regardless of weight and short duration of hyperemic effect, has greatly simplified the method of stress testing as compared to adenosine and dipyridamole. It is the most commonly used currently due to lesser side effects and easier to perform. Regadenoson dose:\nAs mentioned earlier, the dosing of regadenoson is not weight-based like other vasodilators. The dose of regadenoson normally used is 0.4 mg, which is available only in a prefilled 5-ml syringe. The dose is immediately followed by a saline flush. The radiotracer is administered 10 to 20 seconds later, immediately followed by another saline flush. The results of the ADVANCE MPI 2 trial have shown that regadenoson is non-inferior to adenosine for the detection of reversible defects and is safe and better tolerated. The half-life of regadenoson is 2 hours. Contraindications:\n1. Regadenoson is considered contraindicated for patients with second- or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome. 1. Allergic response in the past to the agent\n1. Hypotension with systolic blood pressure \\<90 mmHg. 1."

Caution is advised in patients with reactive airway disease with wheezing\nReversal of vasodilator effects:\nIn patients who suffer from undesirable effects from pharmacologic stress testing agents, caffeine is given generally to counteract the effects. The use of caffeine in reversing the side effects is more beneficial in dipyridamole and regadenoson due to longer duration of action as compared to adenosine. Aminophylline can be used for more threatening side effects. **Dobutamine**\nDobutamine is an inotropic agent that can be used for myocardial perfusion stress testing. Dobutamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pharmacologic stress testing and rarely used currently. Dobutamine is a beta-agonist that results in the stimulation of beta1 and beta2 receptors. Dobutamine, like exercise, increases myocardial oxygen demand and evokes ischemia if there is insufficient perfusion to the affected myocardium that can be seen on stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging. Beta-blockers should be held 24 hours before the dobutamine stress test due to the opposite antagonistic action. Dobutamine dose:\nDobutamine is given as an infusion as an incremental dose beginning at 5 or 10 mcg/kg/min for 3 minutes. It is increased to 20, 30, and then 40 mcg/kg/min, also for 3-min intervals, for a maximum of 12 minutes or until the target heart rate is achieved.

It is also a vasodilator that is FDA-approved for use as an adjunctive agent in thromboembolism prophylaxis in those undergoing cardiac valve replacement and thallium-nuclear stress testing. It is also used off-label to prevent stroke; however, it is not FDA approved for this indication. In addition to its use as a sole agent, the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole also has clinical use. This formulation obtained FDA approval for stroke prevention and as an alternative therapy for those with intolerable headaches. Off-labels for the combination medication include those with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and maintaining hemodialysis graft patency. **Stroke Prevention**\nThe indication for stroke prevention came from the data obtained from the European Stroke Prevention Study 2 Trial (ESPS-2). This randomized control trial evaluated the stroke risk reduction amongst patients with recent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or ischemic strokes. The patients meeting inclusion criteria were categorized into four distinct treatment groups that included placebo treatment, aspirin 25mg twice daily, 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole twice daily, and a combination of dipyridamole with aspirin 25mg twice daily. The study concluded that the group that received the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole showed a reduced risk of stroke compared to the placebo group. Further, the combination treatment arm revealed the most significant stroke risk reduction with an odds ratio of 0.59 compared to aspirin (OR=0.79) and extended-release dipyridamole (OR=0.81). Further, a 2005 meta-analysis performed by Leonardi-Bee et al. compiled data from pertaining randomized control trials that found that dipyridamole use alone reduced the risk of future stroke events compared to control arms. The exact impact of this study is under dispute as 59% of the data collected from this metanalysis was derived from the ESPS-2 trial, and without it, did not obtain statistical significance."

Further, a 2009 study in the New England Journal of Medicine compared the combination of extended-release dipyridamole with aspirin (ASA-ERDP) against clopidogrel for the risk of recurrent stroke. This double-blinded study compared recurrent stroke risk in those taking 25 mg aspirin-200 mg dipyridamole twice daily versus 75 mg clopidogrel daily. The study's conclusion revealed similar results for the primary outcome of stroke recurrence, 8.8% of the clopidogrel group versus 9.0% in the ASA-ERDP group; this elucidated that neither treatment group was superior for reduction of stroke recurrence in comparison to each other. **Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Cardiac Valve Replacement, Adjunct with Warfarin**\nA 1994 metanalysis by Pouleur et al. demonstrated the value of dipyridamole in mechanical cardiac valve replacement by reducing the frequency and risk of embolization. This study included randomized control trials totaling 1141 patients. The data revealed a significant risk reduction for both fatal and non-fatal thromboembolic events when anticoagulation was combined with dipyridamole compared to anticoagulation alone. The decrease in total events, both fatal and non-fatal, demonstrated a 56% reduction, while fatal events showed a reduction of 64%. Overall, this study revealed the significant impact that dipyridamole plays in reducing thromboembolic disease after mechanical cardiac valve replacement. Additionally, a randomized control trial performed previously in 1983 compared using warfarin with either aspirin, dipyridamole, or alone to evaluate the risk of adverse bleeding events in those who underwent mechanical valve replacement. The study concluded that the use of dipyridamole in place of aspirin resulted in a 10% reduction of risk for adverse bleeding events when combined with warfarin. **Role in Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (off label-use)**\nMyocardial perfusion imaging is a form of assessing blood flow to the heart and evaluating coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole was the first agent employed for pharmacologic stress testing but now also includes dobutamine and adenosine-induced testing."

Dipyridamole was the first agent employed for pharmacologic stress testing but now also includes dobutamine and adenosine-induced testing. Administration\nDipyridamole is available in tablet forms of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg strengths. The generic version is also available. In addition to its tablet formulation, there is also an intravenous solution of the strength of 5 mg/mL. The intravenous solution is applicable for its adjunctive use during pharmacologic stress testing, typically administered over four minutes.\n**Indication Specific Dosing**\nThromboembolism prophylaxis in post-cardiac valve replacement: 75 to 100 mg PO 4 times daily as an adjunct to warfarin.\nMyocardial perfusion scan: injectable solution of 5mg/mL is administered at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min IV infusion over 4 minutes. The maximal allowed dose for this use is 70 mg.\n**Dosing Adjustments**\nThe dosing recommendations for patients with significant obesity have not undergone thorough evaluation, although a general guideline of a maximum dose of 70 mg has been recommended. There is no need to dose adjust this medication for those patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in geriatric patients using this medication as its oral formulation is a Beers List medication, although the extended-release form combined with aspirin is not on the Beers List.\n**Pediatric Dosing**\nPediatric use of this medication has limited data, but guidelines suggest 2.0 to 6.0mg/kg/daily for its antiplatelet effect. Given the limited data, dipyridamole is not a first-line agent for the use of antiplatelet therapy for pediatric and adolescent patients."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nWhen using dipyridamole in the setting of pharmacologic stress testing, it is essential to actively look out for the clinical findings associated with an adverse pharmacologic stress test. As outlined above, monitoring for hypoperfusion while undergoing diagnostic testing is imperative to assist in preventing adverse events. It is essential that the entire interprofessional stress-testing team is aware of and actively evaluate the signs of hypoperfusion. The entire team, including the ultrasound technician, nursing team, cardiologist, and any other assistants involved in administering the stress test, understand the signs and symptoms of toxicity. A pharmacist should also review the patient's medication profile to ensure no drug-drug interactions and alert the team of any findings that may raise concerns. In addition to the importance of active monitoring, having the appropriate resources to reverse induced hypoperfusion is also essential to deter sequela. Maintaining an adequate stock solution of aminophylline with suitable syringes is important to allow for time-sensitive reversal when appropriate and necessary. Interprofessional coordination will drive better patient results with minimal adverse events."

Non-invasive testing now includes perfusion echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe clinician must determine the pre-test probability for CAD prior to selecting the diagnostic test. Patients with intermediate probability for CAD are most likely to benefit from additional cardiovascular testing. Nuclear stress testing plays an important role in determining the management of these patients, especially when revascularization is being considered.\nPharmacologic stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging is indicated when exercise stress testing cannot be performed due to an abnormal EKG or the patient's inability to exercise.\nScenarios in which a nuclear stress test may be used for evaluation include:\n- Patients with suspected coronary artery disease\n- Typically, patients who have chest pain suggestive of angina and intermediate to a high probability of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, it should not be performed in patients with ongoing or unstable conditions prior to the relief of symptoms.\n- Patients with prior history of CAD with new or worsening symptoms\n- Patients who have new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular pacing in the EKG\n- Patients with a recent ACS who were treated conservatively or partially revascularized within the past 3 months for evaluation of risk assessment\n- Patients with a prior history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) of more than 5 years or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of more than 2 years and are asymptomatic, one-time testing cardiac stress testing is appropriate.\n- Patients with dyspnea and suspected cardiac origin\n- Patients with newly diagnosed congestive heart failure to evaluate reversible causes such as CAD"

    "text": "- Patients with dyspnea and suspected cardiac origin\n- Patients with newly diagnosed congestive heart failure to evaluate reversible causes such as CAD Normal and Critical Findings\nThere are primarily two modalities of stress \u2013 exercise or pharmacological. In patients who can exercise, it is the preferred form of stress to achieve cardiac workload. It can also measure several factors such as symptoms, hemodynamic response, physical activity, and prognosis of cardiac activity. The radioactive tracer is injected near the peak of physical activity, and it should be continued for at least a minute of exercise to allow the radioactive tracer to distribute. Depending on the SPECT radioactive tracer, image acquisition may begin immediately or can be delayed up to a few hours. Due to the short half-life of PET tracer, pharmacological stress is preferred in these patients. In patients who are unable to exercise or achieve an adequate heart rate response, there are several pharmacological agents to achieve cardiac stress. Broadly speaking, there are two types, vasodilator or inotropic/chronotropic drugs. Examples of vasodilators are adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson. They primarily cause coronary vasodilation and increase coronary blood flow during stress, which is 3 to 5 times the resting blood flow. The flow through the normal coronary arteries increases up to fourfold during coronary vasodilation and radiotracer uptake. Flow-limiting stenosis in the coronary artery causes a relative reduction in blood flow during stress leading to reduced radiotracer uptake, reflecting as a perfusion defect. 1. Adenosine acts via the A2A receptor on coronary arteries. Its effect on other receptors such It has a very short half-life, especially red blood cells, and endothelial cells have rapid uptake. It is administered via infusion pump at the dose of 140 mcg/kg/minute, typically over six minutes, then radionuclide is injected over 10 seconds, and adenosine infusion is continued for additional 3 minutes."

A shorter duration protocol of 4 minutes has been studied and has shown equally effective results. Simultaneous low-level exercise is safe, well-tolerated, and provides improved image quality. 1. Dipyridamole blocks the cellular uptake of adenosine. Its half-life is 30 to 35 minutes, metabolized primarily by the liver, and excreted in small amounts by urine. It is administered via an infusion pump at the dose of 140 mcg/kg per minute for 4 minutes with a maximum dose of 0.56 mg/kg. The radionuclide is administered 3 to 5 minutes after the infusion. Aminophylline is often used as a reversal agent to reduce side effects. Simultaneous low-level exercise improves image quality, allows us to assess exercise capacity, and risk-stratify future cardiac events. 1. Regadenoson is a selective A2A receptor blocker on vascular smooth muscles. Adenosine and dipyridamole act on the A2A receptor and the A1 receptor on the atrioventricular node and A2B, A3, A4, responsible for common side effects such as AV block and bronchospasm, respectively. Regadenoson has a rapid onset of 30 seconds and lasts about 2 to 5 minutes and an intermediate phase of 30 minutes in contrast to adenosine, which has a half-life of 5 seconds. Reagadesone allows for more convenient administration and monitoring. It is administered at a dose of 400 mcg in a prefilled single-dose syringe over 10 seconds, followed immediately by a 5 ml saline flush. The radionuclide is administered after the saline flush. Regadenoson has an added advantage over adenosine and dipyridamole as it can be given to patients who begin with exercise SPECT MPI but are unable to achieve the cardiac workload. Examples of inotropic/chronotropic agents are dobutamine with or without atropine. 1. Dobutamine is administered over graded format starting at 5 mcg/kg and gradually increasing it to 10, 20, 30, and 40 mcg/kg/minute at every 3-minute interval."

Dobutamine is administered over graded format starting at 5 mcg/kg and gradually increasing it to 10, 20, 30, and 40 mcg/kg/minute at every 3-minute interval. The standard end-point of dobutamine rMPI is to achieve a heart rate of at least 85 percent of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. Atropine at a dose of 0.5 mg at each time to a total dose of 2 mg can be administered as needed to achieve the desired heart rate. The procedure should be terminated if there is any significant arrhythmia, hypotension less than 90 mmHg, or severe hypertension. Regadenoson is becoming increasingly popular and is the primary vasodilator used because of its ease of use and better tolerability. The most commonly used radioisotope for SPECT imaging is 99m-technetium labeled perfusion agents such as 99m-Tc-sestamibi, 99m-Tc-tetrofosmin. The use of thallium-201 is becoming increasingly less common as Tc99 has higher energy, less attenuation, and less scatter of photons. - Single isotope protocol is done with Tc99m and can be done as a one-day or two-day protocol. - One-day rest/stress (or stress/rest) study: Radiopharmaceutical agent used for the second injection is generally three times higher than the first dose. Images acquisition is performed 15 to 60 minutes after the injection, or it can be delayed up to 2 hours depending on the type of stress \u2013 exercise vs. pharmacological. Radiation exposure can be reduced substantially by using a weight-based radiopharmaceutical agent and a newer solid-state camera system. - Two-day Tc99m- based protocol: radiopharmaceutical agent is used at the same dosage for rest and stress images. This protocol is more useful in larger patients since low-dose tracer may make image acquisition difficult. But it is cumbersome for patients to perform this entire stress/rest in 2 days. - Stress only: This is a newly developing model based on the theory that the resting images may not be required in patients whose stress images are normal. This allows for lesser radiation exposure and shorter study time."

This allows for lesser radiation exposure and shorter study time. But should be careful in-patient selection, and patients with no prior abnormal rMPI images, no history of CAD or MI without revascularization or cardiomyopathy, and weight more than 300 lbs should be selected. Diagnostic value is higher in patients who undergo ECG-gated technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT rMPI with attenuation correction. However, if the stress images are abnormal, the patient should undergo rest images the following day with a higher radiopharmaceutical dose. Stress-only using T99m usually causes approximately 3 millisieverts radiation exposure. - Dual isotope: This protocol is based on using two different isotopes at rest and stress. TI-201 is used at rest and images acquired within 10 minutes, followed by a Tc99m-based agent during stress image acquisition. The advantage of this protocol is the almost immediate acquisition of rest images, but the major disadvantage is, it is associated with higher radiation exposure, difficulty interpreting the data because of different resolutions at rest, and stress. Dual isotope usually causes approximately 22 millisieverts radiation exposure. - TI-201: This is less commonly utilized because of higher radiation exposure. Stress image acquisition should be done within 10 minutes of TI-201 injection. Unlike the Tc99m based protocol, stress injection should be performed first. If the patient has difficulty breathing with exercise, image acquisition is delayed to avoid myocardial creep \u2013 an artifact from the upward movement of the diaphragm. If the patient can achieve stage III or higher Bruce protocol, image acquisition should be delayed up to 15 minutes post-stress, and the respiratory rate should be less than 25 cycles per minute. PET imaging utilizes rubidium-82 and 13-N ammonia tracers. Rubidium-83 is widely used because it does not require on-site cyclotrons, unlike 13-N ammonia, but it requires a rapid delivery system because its half-life is 75 seconds. PET imaging is different from SPECT because it requires additional external radiation sources for image acquisition and image acquisition after tracer administration."
