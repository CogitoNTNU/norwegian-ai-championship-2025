Introduction\nLarge bowel obstruction is a clinical emergency, often accompanied by sepsis, dehydration, and hemodynamic compromise. The obstruction can be either structural or functional. Patients with a competent ileocecal valve may have a closed-loop obstruction and be very ill upon presentation. Depending on the etiology of the obstruction, an individual may show symptoms before the acute presentation. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of large bowel obstruction is critical to provide prompt resuscitation and diagnosis to limit morbidity and improve outcomes.\nIn some cases, an obstruction is the first clinical sign of colorectal carcinoma, particularly left-sided carcinoma, and up to 25% of colorectal carcinomas present as large bowel obstruction. A reported 8% to 13% of colorectal cancer cases are obstructed at the time of diagnosis. A majority of emergency admissions for colorectal cancer are due to large bowel obstruction. The incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing in young adults, often presenting as acute obstruction."

The incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing in young adults, often presenting as acute obstruction. Etiology\nThe majority of large bowel obstruction arises from neoplastic, neurogenic, inflammatory, and mechanical causes within the colon. However, large bowel obstruction is also caused by extrinsic factors, such as compression from a space-occupying tumor, carcinomatosis, or fibroproliferative process within the peritoneal or retroperitoneal cavities. The most common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults is underlying colorectal cancer. A colonic malignancy may also present in the form of colonic intussusception, and other lesions, including polyps, lymphomas, lipomas, and stool impaction, may also cause intussusception. Approximately 40% of colorectal cancers cause clinical emergencies, and large bowel obstruction is the most common emergent presentation. Benign intrinsic causes of large bowel obstruction include inflammatory processes, foreign body or food blockages, and volvulus, particularly of the sigmoid colon. Inflammation and strictures caused by conditions such as diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, anastomotic narrowing, ischemic colitis, radiation, tuberculosis, and trauma can result in obstruction. Food impaction is more common in older adults, and drug packs and other foreign bodies may cause obstruction or perforation. In rare cases, the sigmoid colon can become incarcerated within a hernia, most commonly within the left inguinal area. External compression causing obstruction occurs secondary to gynecologic neoplasms, carcinomatosis, and lymphadenopathy from a variety of malignancies and inflammatory processes such as pancreatitis. Endometriosis can cause colonic obstruction either intrinsically or extrinsically. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a less common cause of obstruction, characterized by inflammation and deposition of fibrotic tissue, particularly around vascular structures. This condition may result from a systemic, regional, or local response to atherosclerosis due to prior or current infection, malignancy, medication, or radiation."

Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a less common cause of obstruction, characterized by inflammation and deposition of fibrotic tissue, particularly around vascular structures. This condition may result from a systemic, regional, or local response to atherosclerosis due to prior or current infection, malignancy, medication, or radiation. Epidemiology\nAround the turn of the 20th century, volvulus was the most commonly reported cause of large bowel obstruction. However, over the past 100 years, malignancy has become the most common underlying etiology. An estimated 6% lifetime risk of malignant large bowel obstruction has been reported. Until recently, obstruction from colorectal malignancies was most common in individuals in their fifth decade of life, but the incidence of colorectal cancer in this demographic has recently diminished in most parts of the developed world. An increase in colorectal malignancy in individuals younger than 50 has been observed, most of whom have not undergone screening and present with aggressive and advanced disease in the emergency setting. Kwaan et al. examined 31,277 individuals admitted for large bowel obstruction between 2010 and 2015. Of those, 54% were women, 69% were White, 12% were Black, 12% were other races, the median age was 66, 20% were diagnosed with colon cancer, 15.6% with a malignancy outside the colon, 64.7% with benign conditions, including diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other causes. In this study, women with large bowel obstruction were older, had fewer comorbidities, had more malignancies outside the colon, and had more benign obstructions. Black patients tended to be younger than White patients, had more comorbidities, and had a higher likelihood of obstructing colon cancer. Among patients with colorectal cancer, obstruction represents 80% of emergencies and 20% of perforations. According to a 2017 study, the most common site for malignant obstruction was distal to the splenic flexure. Most perforations occur at the tumor site, and the remainder occur proximal to the tumor."

According to a 2017 study, the most common site for malignant obstruction was distal to the splenic flexure. Most perforations occur at the tumor site, and the remainder occur proximal to the tumor. Pathophysiology\nLarge bowel obstruction in a competent ileocecal valve setting involves a segment of the colon that does not permit inflow or outflow. Over time, the segment continues to distend, exacerbated by gas-forming bacteria. The distension initially impedes venous outflow, further contributing to the dilation until arterial inflow is compromised. This process progresses from reversible to irreversible ischemia and necrosis, ultimately leading to perforation. The cecum has the largest diameter and thinnest wall and is thus at greatest risk of perforation. When the colon is obstructed and distended, its motility is disrupted, leading to bacterial overgrowth. Mucosal edema and ischemia lead to the breakdown of the mucosal barrier, resulting in bacterial translocation of the gut flora and fecalization of the small bowel, increasing the risk of bacteremia and sepsis.\nPseudo-obstruction is attributed to excessive sympathetic stimulation within the colon due to a disruption of parasympathetic activity, further exacerbated by the direct stimulation of mechanoreceptors, resulting in decreased motility. Factors contributing to the incidence of volvulus include poor or absent peritoneal fixation of the colon, a longer or redundant colon segment, and thinning of the colonic mesentery in the setting of dysmotility secondary to causes such as chronic constipation or use of laxatives."

History and Physical\nThe clinical features of large bowel obstruction depend on the etiology and the anatomical site of the obstruction. In general, patients may present with pain, abdominal distention, minimal or absent flatus or bowel movements, and nausea and vomiting. Patients with an incompetent ileocecal valve decompress their large bowel into the small bowel, eventually leading to vomiting. However, patients with a competent ileocecal valve have ongoing distension of the obstructed colon and often develop progressive right iliac fossa pain, signifying impending cecal perforation. A rectal examination may reveal a vault empty of stool, a mass, or blood. **Clinical Features of Colorectal Malignancy\u2013Associated Obstruction**\nObstruction caused by underlying colorectal malignancy commonly occurs in the descending or sigmoid colon and rectum, where the diameter of the colon is smaller and the stool is more solid. Individuals may experience changes in bowel habits leading up to an obstruction, possibly an alternating pattern between diarrhea and constipation, as only liquefied content may pass through the narrowed lumen. Symptoms may be present for weeks or months before an acute presentation and may include rectal bleeding and weight loss, but an obstruction may also present abruptly. Patients may or may not have a family history of colorectal cancer. **Clinical Features of Volvulus-Associated Obstruction**\nSigmoid volvulus is common in individuals with limited mobility and a history of constipation, such as those who are bedbound and more sedentary residents of congregate care facilities. A volvulus typically presents more acutely than many other etiologies, with abdominal pain, distension, and an abrupt change in bowel habits. The examination of the abdomen reveals significant distension, tympany, and potentially guarding and rebound."

The examination of the abdomen reveals significant distension, tympany, and potentially guarding and rebound. A cecal volvulus can present as a small bowel obstruction with variation in symptom duration. In rare cases, a volvulus may present with shock or as intermittent and chronic symptomology. Individuals experiencing pseudo-obstruction may be initially indistinguishable from those with a mechanical obstruction, but pain may not feature as prominently. Individuals with pseudo-obstruction may continue to pass flatus and may experience constipation or diarrhea but also exhibit increasing abdominal distension. **Clinical Features of Other Etiology-Associated Obstruction**\nPatients with obstruction due to diverticular disease may present with pain, fever, and a palpable mass, along with distension proximal to the site of obstruction. Large bowel obstruction secondary to a hernia may be associated with a reducible or irreducible mass and overlying skin changes. Sites of herniation that can cause large bowel obstruction include spigelian, lumbar, inguinal, diaphragmatic, lumbar, and intermesenteric regions. A large bowel obstruction due to endometriosis may be characterized by a history of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, rectal pain, or pain during bowel movements. A clinical history of obstructive etiologies, such as uterine fibroids or pelvic malignancy, may include symptoms such as dysmenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles. Large bowel obstruction due to stool impaction is often observed in patients with a history of chronic constipation or the use of medications that reduce bowel motility. Stool impaction is more common in chronically ill or impaired individuals or those with psychiatric or medical conditions that predispose to constipation and bowel irregularity. Affected patients typically present with distension, pain, and fecal incontinence and may develop a stercol ulcer that can cause perforation. A digital rectal examination may reveal a hard stool mass in the rectum. Retroperitoneal fibrosis can cause colonic obstruction, leading to back, flank, and abdominal pain, fevers, fatigue, and weight loss. Clinical features of colonic intussusception can be nonspecific and may include pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, bowel changes, hematochezia, and a mass identified on imaging."

Clinical features of colonic intussusception can be nonspecific and may include pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, bowel changes, hematochezia, and a mass identified on imaging. Evaluation\nObtaining a detailed history, performing a thorough physical examination, and conducting imaging are crucial in evaluating a suspected large bowel obstruction. Laboratory tests for anemia, infection, renal function, and electrolytes are initiated to drive resuscitation and focused treatment, including infusion of contrast for imaging. Leukocytosis and acidosis may indicate tissue ischemia. In addition, testing for _Clostridium difficile_ and any electrolyte dysfunction should be conducted to help direct therapy and decision-making. **Diagnostic Imaging Studies**\nImaging typically begins with supine and upright or decubitus x-rays, which can reveal a dilated colon with a possible transition in the area of the obstruction and a lack of gas in the rectum or any site distal to the obstruction. Air-fluid levels may be evident in the colon. Evidence of necrosis or perforation may also be identified in an x-ray through findings such as pneumoperitoneum and gas in the bowel wall or portal venous system. A suspected obstruction identified on plain film must be distinguished from an ileus or pseudo-obstruction. Ileus may be caused by recent surgery, illness, neurologic or metabolic dysfunction, and demonstrates diffuse dilation without a transition point. Instilling a contrast enema can reliably distinguish mechanical from pseudo-obstruction. A toxic megacolon may be identified by bowel wall thickening throughout the colon. Imaging the patient in multiple postural positions can help assess colonic gas patterns. Air-fluid levels are typically absent in a pseudo-obstruction. Determining the underlying etiology of colonic distension based on X-rays can be challenging. Therefore, computed tomography (CT) is often necessary. CT can often reveal the specific etiology of large bowel obstruction, such as occult hernia, demonstrate any inflammatory or ischemic changes, and provide information regarding metastases."

CT can often reveal the specific etiology of large bowel obstruction, such as occult hernia, demonstrate any inflammatory or ischemic changes, and provide information regarding metastases. Intravenous contrast is useful in evaluating an obstruction; oral contrast is contraindicated. Water-soluble rectal contrast can be administered if further clarification is needed to help elucidate a volvulus or mass; a rectal enema may be used if a colonoscopy with biopsy is attempted. A colonoscopy can be performed with minimal insufflation and can provide a tissue diagnosis, including endometriosis, if the mucosa is involved. For suspected malignancy, the entire colon should be evaluated, given the risk for synchronous lesions. CT or positron emission tomography can be used when a full colonoscopy is not feasible. A sigmoid or cecal volvulus is often evident on an x-ray. A volvulus may demonstrate the classically described coffee bean or bird beak signs. A sigmoid volvulus may extend as a U-shape into the right upper quadrant or above the transverse colon. A cecal volvulus may remain in the right lower quadrant or loop into the left upper quadrant, and the displaced appendix may be visualized in this location with the dilated cecum. Rarely, a volvulus may occur along the transverse colon or splenic flexure. A CT can localize a volvulus and identify any areas of ischemia (see **Image**. Cecal Volvulus). A water-soluble enema may also help delineate and occasionally reduce a volvulus. CT imaging provides a clear view of diverticular obstruction, typically revealing symmetric wall thickening and hyperemia, often accompanied by fat stranding and inflammation. Free fluid, abscesses, and fluid at the root of the mesentery may also be visible. Malignancy may be distinguished from diverticulitis by its shorter segments, asymmetric thickening, and associated lymphadenopathy. A colonic mass or benign lesion may cause an intussusception, appearing on CT as the lead point with mesenteric fat telescoping within a thickened colon, demonstrating a target sign on CT. Inflammatory bowel disease also reveals wall thickening and luminal narrowing within any strictures, whereas mucosal enhancement is present in areas of active inflammation."

Treatment / Management\n**Initial Management**\nBefore any surgical intervention, supportive therapies targeting fluid resuscitation and metabolic dysfunction correction are essential. Patients who have experienced marked cecal distension for several days are at increased risk of perforation and should be considered for some mode of decompression. Serial imaging is critical to monitor the extent of distension over time. Pneumatosis within the cecum or colon often indicates ischemia and possibly imminent perforation. Nasogastric tube insertion can help decompress the stomach in patients with a colonic obstruction and an incompetent ileocecal valve. For patients with perforation, source control is the primary objective. A perforation proximal to the tumor typically leads to widespread fecal contamination and sepsis. In cases of sepsis, damage control measures should be initiated within six hours of resuscitation, if possible, to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mm Hg, and a central venous oxygen saturation of \u226570%, which may require pharmacotherapy including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and alkalinizing agents for severe acidosis. Antibiotic therapy for obstructed but nonperforated processes should cover anaerobes and gram-negative organisms to protect against infection from translocation and, with perforation, should include broad spectrum coverage. Image-guided drainage of any associated abscess is vital for source control. **Large Bowel Obstruction Interventions**\nPrompt intervention in patients with large bowel obstruction is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality from progressive ischemia and perforation. Factors mandating emergent intervention include peritonitis, evidence of ischemia, sepsis, and shock. Broad options for urgent intervention include a single or staged emergency surgery versus a temporizing measure often followed by elective surgery. When considering intervention, a distinction in treatment approach is made for left- versus right-sided obstruction. Early decompression is crucial."

Broad options for urgent intervention include a single or staged emergency surgery versus a temporizing measure often followed by elective surgery. When considering intervention, a distinction in treatment approach is made for left- versus right-sided obstruction. Early decompression is crucial. Many left-sided obstructions can be initially treated with a self-expanding stent or tube as a bridge to surgery. Additional considerations include gross or micro-perforation, which may spread malignancies; comorbidities, such as diabetes and cirrhosis, that may cause clinical deterioration; and the increased morbidity and mortality of emergency surgery. **Stenting Procedures**\nEmergency surgery often requires the creation of a stoma and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, including the risk of future anastomotic leaks. Bridging procedures may allow for a single-stage operation without stoma formation. The use of stenting to temporize or palliate an acute large bowel obstruction allows for clinical preparation for elective surgery and avoids increased morbidity of emergent intervention. Stenting a malignant obstruction may decrease complications, operative time, and frequency of stoma formation. Stenting reduces short-term morbidity and the need for stoma in those with obstructing malignancy in the left colon and reduces postoperative complications and mortality for right-side lesions. Stenting previously was correlated with poor outcomes. The 2014 ESGE guidelines cautioned against using stenting as a bridge to surgery. However, with improved techniques and outcomes, stenting a malignant obstruction is now supported as an alternative to emergency surgery. Many studies have found comparable results between stenting and emergency stoma to alleviate obstruction, but stenting is associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer permanent colostomies. Self-expandable metal stents are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in obstructions caused by malignancy; however, these stents are not approved for obstructions secondary to benign etiologies. Benign obstructions are often treated with balloon dilation or off-label use of stenting. Noncancerous obstructed segments are typically longer and more inflamed, an environment that increases the risk for stent migration, ingrowth, and perforation. Additional experimental endoscopic and percutaneous interventions are used on a case-by-case basis."

Additional experimental endoscopic and percutaneous interventions are used on a case-by-case basis. **Stenting indications**\nThe 2020 update from the ESGE recommends stenting as a bridge to surgery for individuals aged 70 and older with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification III, who have potentially curable left-sided colon cancer or for palliative care. Surgery should typically follow within 5 to 10 days of stenting for malignant large bowel obstructions without perforation. Pavlidis et al. recommend emergency surgery over stenting for fit patients younger than 70, using a primary anastomosis with or without a proximal stoma. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons recommends stenting for an obstructed malignancy depending on patient-specific factors, available equipment, and expertise, estimating a rate of successful stent placement between 77% and 81%. An association between stents and an increased recurrence of malignancy and synchronous tumors has been reported; therefore, interventions following stenting to include segmental resection or subtotal colectomy are also recommended. **Stenting methods**\nStents used for large bowel obstruction may be covered or uncovered, with diameters between 10 and 25 mm and lengths between 12 and 60 mm. Uncovered metal stents are the standard treatment for obstruction secondary to malignancies, as they do not migrate as often, are associated with greater patency, and can be used for longer segments but exhibit tissue ingrowth. A covered stent is associated with higher migration but a lower incidence of obstruction. Some off-label use of covered stenting for benign disease has been reported, but no robust objective data has been found to support the practice. Stenting can be deployed from a colonoscope under fluoroscopy following the placement of a guidewire, and many stents have markers to help with positioning. Post-stenting protocol includes a plain radiograph to assess for free air and stent placement. **Stenting risks**\nRisks of stenting include perforation and possible dissemination of malignancy.

A Japanese study involving 202 patients with colonic obstruction used a low axial force self-expanding metal stent. Study markers included the technical success of stent placement and the clinical alleviation of the obstruction, which were reported to be 97.5% and 97%, respectively, with no perforations noted in this cohort. Some experts have voiced concern that stenting is associated with increased perineural invasion of malignant cells and questioned whether the observed invasion is secondary to the biology of the lesion or induced by the stenting. A study found stenting to be an independent risk factor for perineural invasion unrelated to the time interval from stenting to surgery. The study authors correlated this finding with the severity of the obstruction rather than the stenting, positing that the pathophysiology of the severe obstruction resulted in increased pressure, leading to local invasion. A meta-analysis found higher perineural and lymphatic invasion following stenting, decreasing overall survival. Another meta-analysis found higher recurrence rates when stenting was used instead of an emergent stoma, with a lower 90-day mortality in the colostomy group versus those undergoing an emergent colectomy or stenting as a bridge to surgery. Higher costs in the stent group were identified, and more eventual anastomoses were found in the stoma group. Current recommendations for treating a malignant obstruction following stenting include 2 cycles of chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin before operative intervention to address any theoretical risk for cancer dissemination. **Alternative Interventions to Stenting**\nIn addition to stenting, other options can bridge to surgery or provide palliative treatment for colonic obstruction. One such alternative is endoscopic dilation of the obstruction. Although stenting is more effective for malignancies and post-radiation strictures, balloon dilation is indicated for anastomotic or inflammatory strictures and often requires multiple dilations. The balloon catheter is positioned over a guidewire, inflated with saline, and then deflated and removed. The balloon size must be compatible with the lumen to minimize the risk of perforation."

Successful resolution of obstruction has been reported to be 89% following 1 dilation, with recurrent obstruction noted in up to 50% of cases within 5 years of the dilation procedure. Another alternative to stenting is decompression using a nasogastric or rectal tube, but overall, better short-term outcomes with stenting have been observed compared to decompressive tubing. Studies have reported definitive resection and reconstruction following 7% to 14% of stent cases and 12% to 60% of balloon dilation cases. **Surgical Procedures**\nPatients with malignant obstruction require surgery as a component of curative oncologic management. Surgical interventions range from a single-stage procedure intended to be curative to multiple interventions involving alleviation of the obstruction, followed by a multi-stage oncologic resection and restoration of continuity. Patients with advanced disease may undergo palliative intervention. The surgical approach differs by anatomical location and disease stage. In patients with metastatic disease, a defunctioning stoma can allow for the timely start of chemotherapy. Patients with early-stage nonmetastatic disease may undergo resection with anastomosis, followed by adjuvant therapy as necessary. A two-stage operation remains common, including an initial primary resection with a colostomy or a diverting colostomy, followed by resection or reanastomosis. In experienced hands, laparoscopy has been associated with fewer complications, increased 3-year overall survival, and disease-free survival. A single-stage operation for a malignant obstruction, including washout, resection, and primary anastomosis, is recommended for individuals younger than 70 with an ASA score of I or II without significant comorbidities. A study involving 600 patients with right-sided malignant obstructions indicated higher complication and mortality rates in those undergoing a single-staged procedure; however, their 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were comparable to patients who underwent a multi-stage procedure. A Japanese study highlighted increased 90-day mortality in adults older than 75 who underwent primary resection for obstructed colon cancer."

    "text": "A Japanese study highlighted increased 90-day mortality in adults older than 75 who underwent primary resection for obstructed colon cancer. The World Journal of Emergency Surgery (WJES) treatment guidelines for perforated colon cancer, if the perforation is at the tumor site, recommend resection with anastomosis for a right- or left-sided process if there is no sepsis. If left-sided cancer perforates at a site proximal to the tumor, a subtotal colectomy may be required. In this setting, the recommendation is, if possible, limited resection of the terminal ileum and allowance for a distal colon remnant above peritoneal reflection to reduce the impact of diarrhea and stool incontinence. No randomized controlled studies exist that compare the creation of an anastomosis versus a diverting stoma in the perforation setting, and an overlap in the percentage of anastomotic leaks is present when comparing emergent and elective cases. The WJES supports resection with anastomosis for right-sided obstructing cancers and an internal bypass versus stenting for nonresectable tumors and palliative situations. An option for right-sided stenting includes using a self-expanding through-the-scope stent. Neoadjuvant therapy is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer, and a transverse colostomy may be created in this setting. The WJES asserts that stool in the colon does not affect the rate of anastomotic dehiscence. The optimal surgical approach for malignant obstruction remains a topic of debate, both in curative and palliative settings, for elective and emergent situations. Significant discussion persists regarding single- versus two-stage procedures for left-sided obstruction. Many stomas do not get reversed, and individuals who undergo reversal are subject to possible increased morbidity and mortality, with uncertain long-term survival benefits. Age, ASA status, operative conditions, cancer stage, and surgeon experience all influence outcomes. The use of tube decompression for left-sided malignant obstruction as a bridge to surgery remains debated, suggesting that palliative stenting is preferable to a colostomy due to lower morbidity and mortality. Studies comparing colostomy to stenting found similar morbidity but shorter recovery for stenting, but stent migration and perforations increased morbidity and mortality."

    "text": "The use of tube decompression for left-sided malignant obstruction as a bridge to surgery remains debated, suggesting that palliative stenting is preferable to a colostomy due to lower morbidity and mortality. Studies comparing colostomy to stenting found similar morbidity but shorter recovery for stenting, but stent migration and perforations increased morbidity and mortality. Stent complications may be associated with the use of drugs such as bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic. Stenting may increase the potential for a successful subsequent laparoscopic tumor resection but may promote tumor dissemination and lymph node invasion and pose an increased risk for perforation, both of which impact disease-free survival. However, many studies comparing stenting to emergency surgery found no difference in recurrence, 3-year, or 5-year mortality. **Etiology-Guided Interventions**\nFor patients with sigmoid volvulus, tube decompression should be attempted with a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscope. A rectal tube is left in place following successful decompression to allow egress of gas and prevent recurrence. Many cases of sigmoid volvulus ultimately require resection or fixation of the sigmoid colon. Patients who cannot be decompressed require more urgent surgery. A cecal volvulus typically mandates more urgent intervention. In limited cases, the intervention for a cecal volvulus may consist of fixation rather than resection. Creating a cecostomy, while the least invasive, carries the highest mortality and complication risk compared to the relatively low mortality of resection. An incarcerated hernia may be successfully reduced, but surgery is required for irreversible ischemia and an irreducible or strangulated hernia. Obstruction from endometriosis can be treated with stenting or resection. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is responsive to steroids and immunomodulation, but a large bowel obstruction from this etiology typically requires surgery. If a colonic stricture is identified during an evaluation for a large bowel obstruction, it is important to rule out malignancy before deciding upon an intervention. A person diagnosed with pseudo-obstruction may benefit from neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which can resolve the pseudo-obstruction in up to 94% of cases. A standard dose is 2.0 mg of intravenous neostigmine, with bradycardia being a common side effect that can be treated with atropine. If pharmacologic treatment is not successful, patients require decompression or surgery, which carries additional risks due to bowel distension."

Patients with impending perforation, cecal ischemia, or fecal peritonitis require an emergency intervention. A cecostomy can be performed on a viable bowel or during right colectomy, as opposed to subtotal colectomy for ischemia and perforation. Tube cecostomy may be a viable option for patients who are stable but have not resolved and can performed through an open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous approach. **Alternative Interventions**\nAdjuncts and alternative treatments have been used for colonic obstruction. Laser coagulation may facilitate the dilation of benign strictures, but treating the underlying cause is essential. For example, antituberculosis medications are used for an obstruction from tuberculosis. Disimpaction may be attempted, digitally or through an enema, for a nonperforated, obstructing stool impaction. If successful, this is followed by a maintenance bowel regimen. Alternatives to surgery have been described for pathology within the colon, including the use of fibrin glue for fistulae and perforations, but the recurrence rate is high with these modalities. Endoscopic treatments have been applied selectively, including through-the-scope and over-the-scope methods, endoscopic suturing, and tracking systems."

Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials\nIn 2022, the Colorectal Endoscopic Stenting Trial (CReST) demonstrated that stenting for left-sided colon malignancy alleviated obstruction in 82% of patients and reduced the rate of emergent stoma formation without a difference in 30-day mortality or 3-year recurrence rates. In 2022, Kanaka et al. analyzed complications and mortality rates associated with stenting for right-sided colon cancers as a bridge to surgery versus emergency resection. Their findings indicated that stenting led to fewer postoperative complications and lower mortality compared to emergency surgery. A retrospective study conducted in China examined 1474 individuals who underwent surgery for colonic obstruction and identified factors related to diagnosis and prognosis. The authors found biologic markers, cell populations, and enzymes positively correlated with obstruction, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A study from the Netherlands in 2021 found a correlation between a longer time to elective surgery following a bridge-to-surgery procedure and overall survival. The authors compared time intervals of greater than and less than 4 weeks to elective surgery for patients who initially underwent temporizing measures for obstructed left-sided colon cancer. In the study, 38 patients underwent intervention before and 56 after 4 weeks, and those with the longer wait time had improved overall survival. Kwaan et al. studied the effect of time-to-intervention for a large bowel obstruction on morbidity and mortality in a group who were admitted and underwent a procedure consisting of colectomy, stoma, or stenting within 2 days of hospital admission."

Pearls and Other Issues\nIn medical centers with interventional radiologists or gastroenterologists, a colonic stent can be inserted using a colonoscope under direct visualization to decompress the bowel and allow for elective surgery when the patient has been clinically optimized. In facilities without advanced technology or expertise, a rectal or nasogastric tube may allow for temporary decompression, but a stoma or resection is often necessary. Patients with a large bowel obstruction from any etiology should be closely monitored. The duration of abdominal distension is more closely associated with the risk for perforation than absolute diameter, and lack of timely intervention can result in significant clinical consequences. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for any indication of perforation, including the possibility of missing an occult perforation on an x-ray or ultrasound.\nThe morbidity and mortality of large bowel obstruction depend on the etiology and presence of comorbidities. In most cases, early intervention results in better outcomes. Mortality is significantly higher with bowel perforation or necrosis. Mortality rates of 15% to 30% have been reported in patients with perforation during large bowel obstruction. Recent use of self-expandable metallic stents for malignant bowel obstruction has yielded good short-term results, but long-term survival is not greatly altered."

    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nSmall bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency resulting from mechanical or functional disruption of intestinal transit. This condition is most frequently caused by postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, tumors, or less common conditions like volvulus, gallstone ileus, or endometriosis. SBO presents with hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and obstipation. The pathophysiology includes bowel distension, impaired venous return, mucosal ischemia, bacterial translocation, and, in severe cases, necrosis, perforation, and peritonitis. Diagnosis involves clinical assessment and imaging, with computed tomography being the gold standard to identify the transition point, ischemia, or perforation. Initial management includes fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and nasogastric decompression, with surgery indicated for strangulation, ischemia, or unresolved obstruction.\nClinicians participating in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of SBO. The course emphasizes the importance of early recognition of complications like ischemia and strangulation and highlights evidence-based protocols for nonoperative and surgical management. This recognition enhances clinician's diagnostic accuracy and decision-making skills, equipping them with the tools to improve patient outcomes in this complex and potentially life-threatening condition.\n**Objectives:**\n- Apply current imaging modalities and strategize a management plan for optimal timing of exploratory surgical procedures to detect the etiology of small bowel obstruction.\n- Implement evidence-based guidelines for a safe initial nonoperative phase of management while monitoring patients for resolution or worsening to prevent complications of small bowel obstruction.\n- Differentiate between mechanical and functional causes of small bowel obstruction using clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.\n- Communicate interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate rapid diagnosis and management options for patients with small bowel obstruction."

Introduction\nSmall bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common and potentially life-threatening surgical emergency that accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. This condition is characterized by the triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension, reflecting the disruption of normal intestinal flow. SBO can be broadly categorized into simple obstructions, which involve mechanical blockage without ischemia, and strangulated obstructions, which are associated with compromised blood flow, bowel ischemia, and potential necrosis. Prompt diagnosis and management are critical to prevent severe complications, including gangrenous bowel and perforation.\nThe most common cause of SBO is postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, while other etiologies include malignancies, inflammatory strictures, and congenital anomalies. Initial management includes fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, nasogastric tube decompression, and early identification of strangulation. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Nonoperative management is often effective for partial obstructions, while surgical intervention, such as adhesiolysis or bowel resection, is required in cases of complete obstruction, ischemia, or perforation. This activity examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management strategies for SBO, emphasizing evidence-based practices and recent advances in care."

This activity examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management strategies for SBO, emphasizing evidence-based practices and recent advances in care. Etiology\nThe etiology of SBO encompasses a broad spectrum of mechanical and functional causes, each impacting management strategies and timing of surgical intervention. Mechanical SBO results from a physical barrier to the passage of bowel contents and can be classified based on the location of the obstruction: intraluminal, such as gallstone ileus; intramural, such as malignant lesions; and extrinsic, such as adhesions. In contrast, functional obstruction, termed ileus or paralytic ileus, arises from impaired peristalsis or metabolic disorders rather than a physical barrier. **Adhesions**\nPostoperative adhesions are the leading cause of SBO in developed countries, accounting for up to 74% of cases, and are the second leading cause in developing nations. They result from fibrotic scar tissue forming after surgeries, which occur in as many as 97% of common surgeries such as appendectomy, colectomy, and gynecological surgery. Adhesions are also seen after laparoscopic surgeries, though less frequently than open procedures. SBO that is secondary to adhesions in an abdomen without prior surgery, ie, a \u201cvirgin abdomen,\u201d is very rarely seen but may occur in conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever and recurrent serositis. The rarity of these types of SBO can result in a delay in diagnosis with complications leading to sepsis and death, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical suspicion and timely imaging for diagnosis\n**Hernias**\nAbdominal wall hernias, external (eg, inguinal or umbilical) and internal, are the second most common cause of SBO in developed countries (globally the leading cause). These hernias account for approximately 2% to 10% of cases and often require surgical intervention to relieve obstruction and prevent complications such as strangulation or ischemia."

Notably, in patients with a \u201cvirgin abdomen,\u201d abdominal wall hernias are the most frequent cause of SBO. Internal hernias account for less than 1% of intestinal obstruction cases. They can be congenital or acquired, and SBOs caused by these hernias are managed operatively. **Malignancies and Tumors**\nMalignancy is the third most common cause of SBO after intraabdominal adhesions and hernias. Malignant bowel obstruction, resulting from primary or metastatic cancers, accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of cases. The most common primary small bowel tumors that cause SBO are adenocarcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Metastases to the small intestine are far more common than primary tumors. The small bowel is a frequent site of metastasis, particularly from tumors of the colon, pancreas, ovary, and melanoma. Other tumors involved in SBO are lymphoma, leiomyomas, and desmoid tumors. **Gallstone Ileus**\nA rare cause, gallstone ileus, occurs when a gallstone enters the bowel through a biliary-enteric fistula, causing obstruction, typically at the ileocecal valve. Diagnosis is based on imaging findings, including the Rigler triad: mechanical obstruction, pneumobilia, and an ectopic gallstone within the bowel lumen. **Inflammatory and Infectious Conditions**\nCrohn disease is a significant cause of SBO, with inflammation due to active disease accounting for 5% of all SBOs. Up to 80% of patients with ileal disease require surgical intervention at some point in their lives. In patients with small bowel Crohn disease, one of the primary surgical indications for small bowel resection is inflammatory SBO, followed by intestinal fistula and abscess. Although many patients develop disease recurrence at the anastomosis, some develop SBO without evidence of inflammation at the transition point. Endometriosis can also lead to acute SBO through inflammation or adhesions. Acute SBO secondary to intestinal endometriosis underscores the pivotal role of laparoscopic surgery in the evaluation of SBO. Infectious processes, such as radiation enteritis, may cause delayed-onset obstruction due to fibrosis and ischemia."

Acute SBO secondary to intestinal endometriosis underscores the pivotal role of laparoscopic surgery in the evaluation of SBO. Infectious processes, such as radiation enteritis, may cause delayed-onset obstruction due to fibrosis and ischemia. Approximately a third of patients with chronic radiation enteritis may ultimately require surgical intervention for indications such as obstruction. **Motility Disorders**\nSBO can also result from intestinal dysmotility (ie, impaired bowel movement without a physical blockage) that can be caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders like chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, where the intestines lack normal peristaltic activity, or by drug-induced motility issues, such as those caused by opioids or anticholinergics. Additionally, enteric myopathies, either primary or secondary to conditions like muscular dystrophy, affect the smooth muscle of the small bowel, leading to motility dysfunction. Enteric neuropathy, caused by neurological or metabolic conditions (eg, diabetes or Parkinson disease), can also disrupt normal motility, presenting with symptoms similar to mechanical SBO. Proper diagnosis requires imaging and sometimes specialized tests to differentiate functional obstructions from mechanical causes, and treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition and supporting motility. **Rare Causes**\nSmall bowel encapsulation is a rare cause of SBO. In this condition, the small intestine is encased by a fibrous membrane within the peritoneum, limiting its movement and potentially causing obstruction. This condition can present as acute or chronic SBO, often requiring imaging such as CT scans for diagnosis. Encapsulation can result from congenital conditions or be secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes. Small bowel volvulus is another uncommon cause, where the bowel twists around its mesentery, obstructing blood flow and causing ischemia. Volvulus can occur anywhere in the small bowel but is more common in the midgut; this leads to bowel distention, pain, and potentially ischemia or necrosis if not treated promptly. Volvulus may be associated with abnormal intestinal mobility or congenital malformations, like malrotation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through radiographic imaging (ie, CT or contrast studies), and surgical intervention is often required to untwist the bowel and prevent ischemia. **Pediatric**\nCongenital or acquired adhesions are the most common causes of SBO. The second most common cause is intussusception."

The second most common cause is intussusception. Epidemiology\nSBO is a common surgical emergency, contributing to 15% to 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain and accounting for approximately 80% of all bowel obstructions. Each year, over 300,000 laparotomies are performed in the United States for SBO. The incidence of SBO is closely associated with the prevalence of abdominal surgeries, as postoperative adhesions are the leading cause, responsible for more than 75% of cases. The risk of SBO increases with the number of prior intraabdominal procedures, emphasizing the importance of surgical history in assessing patient risk. SBO is observed across all age groups but is more common in older adults due to higher rates of abdominal surgeries, malignancies, and hernias. Sex differences in etiology are evident, with women more prone to adhesion-related SBO due to gynecological procedures, while men are more likely to experience hernia-related obstruction. In low-resource settings, hernias are a predominant cause due to limited access to elective hernia repair surgeries. SBO is less common in children and typically results from congenital abnormalities such as malrotation or intussusception. Over the past 4 decades, advancements in imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy, and laparoscopic techniques have significantly altered the management of SBO. Before 1981, surgery was the definitive treatment. Since then, adopting nonoperative protocols has improved patient selection for timely surgical intervention, such as laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Despite these advancements, recurrent SBO remains a concern, with a recurrence rate of 12% to 32% after initial surgical management. Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to complications such as strangulation, bowel ischemia, and sepsis\u2014conditions associated with a mortality rate exceeding 25%."

Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to complications such as strangulation, bowel ischemia, and sepsis\u2014conditions associated with a mortality rate exceeding 25%. Pathophysiology\nSBO results from an interruption in the normal flow of intestinal contents due to a mechanical blockage or functional impairment. This disruption triggers a series of pathological processes affecting the bowel wall, vascular supply, and systemic physiology. These processes can escalate rapidly, especially in cases of strangulation or ischemia, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and intervention. **Mechanical Obstruction**\nIn mechanical SBO, a physical barrier obstructs the bowel lumen, creating a transition point where proximal bowel distention and distal bowel decompression occur. The obstructing lesion prevents the passage of intestinal contents, leading to increased intraluminal pressure proximal to the obstruction. This pressure gradient causes:\n- Proximal bowel distention\n- This may induce vomiting as the bowel attempts to relieve pressure. - Distal bowel decompression\n- This occurs along with inhibition of peristalsis distal to the obstruction, while proximal peristalsis temporarily increases to overcome the blockage. Common causes of mechanical obstruction include adhesions, hernias, tumors, strictures, and volvulus. **Physiological Consequences**\n- Impaired venous flow and bowel wall edema\n- As the proximal bowel distends, venous outflow from the bowel wall is compromised, resulting in bowel wall edema and inflammation. These changes can exacerbate luminal narrowing and impair the oxygenation of the bowel tissue. - Third spacing and fluid loss\n- Increased bowel wall permeability leads to fluid and electrolyte sequestration into the bowel lumen and third spacing into the peritoneal cavity as ascitic fluid. This fluid loss, coupled with vomiting and decreased oral intake, contributes to dehydration, hypovolemia, and metabolic disturbances."

This fluid loss, coupled with vomiting and decreased oral intake, contributes to dehydration, hypovolemia, and metabolic disturbances. - Bacterial translocation\n- The thickened, inflamed, and ischemic bowel wall becomes more permeable, allowing bacteria, predominantly _Escherichia coli_ , to translocate into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity. This can result in peritonitis, bacteremia, and systemic infection. - Ischemia and infarction\n- Prolonged obstruction increases intraluminal pressure to a point where arterial blood flow is compromised. This results in ischemia, necrosis, and, if untreated, perforation. Perforation leads to peritonitis, which can progress to sepsis and death. - Systemic effects\n- The combination of fluid loss, bacterial translocation, and ischemia activates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increasing the risk of septic shock and multiorgan failure. **Distinction Based on Obstruction Location**\n- Proximal SBO\n- Characterized by significant vomiting, minimal abdominal distension, and rapid onset of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances\n- Distal SBO\n- Associated with more pronounced abdominal distension, delayed vomiting, and slower progression of systemic complications\n**Functional Obstruction**\nIn functional SBO, peristalsis fails due to metabolic disturbances, neural inhibition, or inflammation (paralytic ileus).

Histopathology\nThe histopathological changes in SBO evolve in response to the obstruction's severity, duration, and underlying cause. The diagnosis can be confirmed with histology in a unit with expertise in this pathology area. Early stages are marked by mucosal edema, hyperemia, and increased intraluminal pressure, impairing venous return and causing fluid accumulation in the mucosa and submucosa. This fluid results in villous edema and mild inflammatory cell infiltration, primarily by neutrophils and lymphocytes. Capillary dilation and vascular engorgement in the lamina propria lead to hyperemia and increased permeability. As the obstruction progresses, ischemia exacerbates tissue damage, causing mucosal ulceration and sloughing of the epithelial layer, compromising the mucosal barrier. Bowel wall inflammation intensifies with polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and bacterial translocation, particularly by _E coli_ , increases the risk of peritonitis or bacteremia. Prolonged ischemia leads to necrosis, initially affecting the mucosa and extending to the muscularis propria and serosa. The bowel wall thickens with fibrin deposition and inflammation, and in severe cases, full-thickness necrosis appears as coagulative necrosis, where cellular details are lost and tissues exhibit hypereosinophilic staining. In cases of strangulated obstruction caused by herniation, volvulus, or adhesions, hemorrhagic necrosis and venous congestion are common\u2014with the bowel wall darkened and thickened due to blood accumulation. Gangrenous changes, marked by liquefactive necrosis and mixed inflammatory infiltrates, may develop; the serosal surface may show fibrinopurulent exudates, indicating secondary peritonitis. Prolonged ischemia can also cause vascular thrombosis in mesenteric veins, worsening ischemia and infarction. Reperfusion after ischemia leads to oxidative stress and neutrophilic infiltration, contributing to cellular injury and inflammation. Histological features vary depending on the etiology of SBO. For example, adhesions and bands typically show fibrosis and mesothelial hyperplasia at adhesion sites, while strangulated hernias display congestion, necrosis, and inflammation."

History and Physical\n**History**\nA patient's history and physical examination are essential for diagnosing SBO and determining its severity. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain, which is often crampy and colicky, correlating with peristalsis as the bowel attempts to overcome the obstruction. The pain may become constant and severe if the obstruction worsens. Vomiting is another hallmark symptom, especially with proximal obstructions, and may start with gastric contents before becoming bilious as the obstruction becomes more distal. Persistent vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic alkalosis. Abdominal distension, due to the accumulation of gas and fluids above the obstruction, is common and may be particularly noticeable in high or complete obstructions. Changes in bowel movements, including obstipation or decreased stool and gas passage, are also typical, though partial obstructions may still allow for some output early on. A key component of the history is identifying prior abdominal surgeries, particularly those that could lead to adhesions, as postoperative adhesions are the most common cause of SBO. A history of abdominal hernias or malignancies should also be explored, as these conditions are significant risk factors for SBO. Additionally, the patient\u2019s medical history may reveal conditions like Crohn disease, radiation therapy, or neurological disorders, which can predispose them to impaired motility and SBO. **Physical**\nOn physical examination, the patient may appear uncomfortable or anxious due to pain, with signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and tachycardia, especially in the case of persistent vomiting. Abdominal inspection may reveal visible peristalsis and distension, particularly in thin patients."

Percussion typically reveals a tympanic abdomen due to gas-filled loops, though dullness can occur in cases of fluid accumulation or bowel perforation. Early in the obstruction, bowel sounds may be hyperactive or high-pitched as the body attempts to overcome the blockage. However, in more severe cases, bowel sounds may become absent, mainly if strangulation or ischemia is present. A rectal examination may be helpful to check for fecal impaction, which could contribute to the obstruction. In some cases, the absence of stool could suggest a more proximal obstruction. Finally, if peritonitis or bowel perforation is suspected, the patient may develop signs of peritonitis, such as rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding, indicating a surgical emergency. This history and physical exam are critical in establishing the diagnosis, determining whether the obstruction is partial or complete, and guiding further imaging studies and treatment decisions."

Evaluation\nThe evaluation of SBO involves a combination of laboratory tests, radiographic imaging, and occasionally more specialized studies. These tests are crucial for confirming the diagnosis, determining the severity and cause of the obstruction, and guiding appropriate management. **Laboratory Tests**\nLaboratory testing in SBO primarily assesses the patient's overall health, identifies complications, and helps to monitor for signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or infection:\n- Complete blood count (CBC)\n- A CBC may show leukocytosis, indicating infection or inflammation, which can be seen in strangulated obstruction or peritonitis cases. Anemia may be present in cases of chronic obstruction due to subclinical blood loss or nutritional deficiencies. - Electrolytes and renal function\n- A basic or comprehensive metabolic panel can assess hydration status, electrolyte imbalances (such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis), and kidney function. Vomiting, fluid sequestration in the intestines, and third-spacing of fluids can lead to dehydration, which, if severe, may result in prerenal acute kidney injury. - Arterial blood gas (ABG)\n- An ABG panel\n- may reveal metabolic alkalosis in prolonged vomiting or bowel ischemia, while lactic acidosis may indicate bowel ischemia or infarction. - Lactate levels\n- Elevated lactate levels can suggest tissue hypoxia, indicating ischemia or necrosis of the bowel, particularly in the context of strangulated obstruction. - Amylase/lipase\n- Although these tests are typically used to evaluate pancreatitis, they may be elevated in cases of SBO if there is associated pancreatic involvement or strangulation of a segment of the small intestine."

This study can reveal characteristic findings such as:\n- Dilated loops of small bowel\n- Air-fluid levels are visible on upright images, indicating proximal bowel distention. - Absence of gas in the colon\n- This finding suggests a complete obstruction, especially if the obstruction is distal to the small intestine. - Step ladder pattern\n- This pattern of air-fluid levels in the small intestine can indicate obstruction. - Signs of perforation\n- Free air under the diaphragm on an upright chest x-ray suggests perforation. Plain radiography has poor sensitivity, with rates ranging from 50% to 80%. While radiography can serve as an initial screening test for detecting air-fluid levels or free air in the abdomen, it does not provide sufficient imaging to identify the cause, extent, or complications of SBO. A small bowel diameter greater than 6 cm is concerning and indicates a severe obstruction that may pose a high risk for compromised viability. **CT Scan**\nA CT scan of the abdomen is considered the gold standard for diagnosing SBO. CT scans are more sensitive than x-rays for detecting SBO, particularly in assessing the underlying cause. This study can help differentiate between simple and complicated (strangulated or ischemic) SBO. This imaging can be enhanced using intravenous contrast, provided the patient has normal kidney function and no contraindications. Key findings include:\n- Bowel distention\n- This appears similar to that on x-rays but is more detailed and can help quantify the extent."

Key findings include:\n- Bowel distention\n- This appears similar to that on x-rays but is more detailed and can help quantify the extent. - Transition point\n- This is the location of the obstruction, which is critical in planning surgical or conservative management. - Bowel wall thickening\n- This finding is suggestive of ischemia, inflammation, or infection. - Mesenteric stranding\n- In cases of bowel ischemia or perforation, this can be seen. - Signs of perforation\n- Free air or fluid in the abdomen can indicate perforation. - Absence of contrast in bowel\n- In cases of a complete obstruction, contrast may not reach beyond the obstruction site. **Ultrasound**\nAlthough not typically the first choice for diagnosing SBO, abdominal ultrasound can be useful, particularly in children and pregnant women, due to its noninvasive nature. Additionally, ultrasound does not result in radiation exposure and has the benefit of rapid and serial examinations. This study can detect bowel distention, peristalsis, and the presence of fluid or air in the bowel, and is often used in cases of suspected bowel perforation or other intraabdominal pathology. The following are pathological findings that can be seen on ultrasound:\n- A dilated small bowel loop measuring more than 3 cm in diameter suggests an obstruction or ileus. - An edematous bowel wall measuring more than 3 mm indicates an obstruction or other intestinal inflammatory cause. - The noncompressibility of the bowel and the appearance of free fluid suggest obstruction. - Anterograde-retrograde peristalsis is specific for obstruction. - The visualization of a transition point is specific for obstruction. A transition point on ultrasound is demonstrated by a thick-walled, noncompressible bowel loop adjacent to a loop of decompressed small bowel. Ultrasound does not replace a CT scan and should not delay surgical consultation. This study is useful in cases where it can facilitate diagnostic evaluation and rule out other causes."

This is particularly useful for evaluating patients suspected of tumors or foreign bodies causing the obstruction. - Diagnostic laparoscopy\n- In cases where the etiology of the SBO is unclear or there is a suspicion of strangulation, peritonitis, or ischemia, diagnostic laparoscopy may be employed. This minimally invasive operation allows direct visualization of the abdominal cavity, aiding in the diagnosis of the cause and in planning surgical intervention. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n- MRI is occasionally used, particularly in special circumstances such as with patients who are pregnant or when CT is contraindicated. This study provides detailed soft tissue imaging and can be useful for detecting complications like ischemia or tumors."

This study provides detailed soft tissue imaging and can be useful for detecting complications like ischemia or tumors. Treatment / Management\nThe treatment and management of SBO require a multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes early recognition and intervention to optimize patient outcomes. **Initial Resuscitation**\nThe initial management of SBO begins with fluid resuscitation to address hypovolemia caused by third-spacing of fluids, vomiting, and reduced oral intake. Isotonic intravenous fluids, such as lactated Ringer or normal saline, are administered to restore intravascular volume and correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nasogastric tube decompression is employed to alleviate gastric distension and vomiting, reduce the risk of aspiration, and provide symptomatic relief. In prolonged cases or when surgery is delayed, nutritional support via enteral or parenteral routes may be necessary to prevent malnutrition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gut flora, including gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, should be administered, particularly when strangulation or perforation is suspected. Surgical consultation should be obtained promptly, as many cases of SBO, especially those involving complete obstruction or signs of ischemia, require operative management. **Nonoperative Management**\nNonoperative or conservative management is suitable for simple SBO without signs of ischemia, peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. This approach involves bowel rest with the patient kept nil per os to minimize bowel distension. Serial monitoring of vital signs, abdominal exams, and laboratory tests is essential to detect any worsening condition. Water-soluble contrast studies using agents like gastrograffin can help resolve adhesional obstructions and offer prognostic value by indicating whether the obstruction may resolve without surgery. **Indications for Surgery**\nSurgical intervention is indicated for patients with evidence of strangulation, such as fever, tachycardia, localized tenderness, leukocytosis, or acidosis."

Surgical intervention is imperative when SBO fails to resolve with conservative measures or when there are signs of peritonitis or bowel ischemia, ensuring timely and effective treatment. **Surgical Management**\nSurgical options depend on the underlying cause of SBO. Adhesiolysis is the most common procedure, performed laparoscopically or via open surgery, to release fibrous bands causing the obstruction. For strangulated obstruction, resection of the necrotic bowel may be required, followed by either primary anastomosis or stoma formation, depending on the extent of damage and patient stability. In cases of questionable bowel viability or extensive ischemia, second-look laparotomy or temporary abdominal closure techniques, such as vacuum-assisted closure, may be required. Hernia-related obstructions are managed with hernia reduction and repair, while tumor-related obstructions often necessitate bowel resection, sometimes with palliative intent in advanced malignancy cases. Palliative options like octreotide can be employed for malignant obstructions. Preventative strategies, such as laparoscopic techniques and barrier agents like a chemically modified membrane made of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose that's applied to the surface of tissues, help reduce adhesion formation. **Postoperative Care**\nPostoperative care involves close monitoring for complications such as infection, anastomotic leaks, or recurrent obstruction. Early ambulation is encouraged to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and expedite recovery. Nutritional support with gradual reintroduction of oral intake is guided by the resolution of bowel function, evidenced by decreased NG tube output, bowel sounds, and passage of gas or stool. **Management of Functional Obstruction**\nFunctional obstructions, such as paralytic ileus, are treated with supportive measures, including bowel rest, correction of metabolic abnormalities, reduction in narcotic use, and the potential use of prokinetic agents like metoclopramide. **Recurrent Obstructions**\nFor patients with recurrent SBO, often due to adhesions, preventive strategies may include minimally invasive surgical techniques and adhesion barriers during surgery to reduce the formation of future adhesions. **Interdisciplinary Approach**\nOptimal management of SBO relies on collaboration among surgeons, radiologists, gastroenterologists, critical care specialists, pharmacists, and nursing teams."

Prognosis\nThe prognosis of SBO depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, the patient's overall health status, the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment, and whether the obstruction is simple or complicated (eg, involving strangulation or perforation). Early diagnosis and prompt management significantly improve outcomes, while delays in treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. **Simple SBO**\nPatients with simple SBO, where there is no evidence of ischemia or perforation, generally have a favorable prognosis. Nonoperative management resolves most cases of partial or adhesional obstructions without surgery. Recovery is typically rapid if managed appropriately, with mortality rates in these cases being low (1%\u20135%). However, recurrent SBO remains a challenge, particularly in patients with prior surgeries and adhesions. **Complicated SBO**\nComplicated SBO, involving bowel strangulation, ischemia, or perforation, carries a significantly worse prognosis due to the risk of sepsis, peritonitis, and multiorgan failure. Mortality rates in these cases range from 10% to 40%, depending on the extent of bowel compromise and the speed of surgical intervention. Strangulated obstructions, which may progress to gangrene or perforation, demand urgent surgical treatment to minimize life-threatening complications. **Prognostic Factors**\nSeveral factors influence prognosis:\n- Etiology\n- Adhesional SBO generally has a better prognosis than obstruction caused by malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease. Malignant bowel obstruction often indicates advanced disease, with limited curative options and a focus on palliative care. - Age and comorbidities\n- Elderly patients and those with significant comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have higher risks of complications and mortality."

Complications\nSBO can lead to a range of complications, many of which are life-threatening if not promptly recognized and managed. These complications arise from the mechanical disruption of intestinal flow, vascular compromise, or secondary systemic effects. **Mechanical and Local Complications**\n- Bowel ischemia and strangulation\n- Increased intraluminal pressure compromises venous return, leading to bowel wall edema and, eventually, arterial ischemia. Strangulation occurs in approximately 25% of cases, particularly in closed-loop obstructions or hernias, and may result in necrosis, perforation, and gangrene. - Perforation and peritonitis\n- Persistent ischemia or bowel necrosis can lead to perforation, spilling luminal contents into the peritoneal cavity and causing bacterial peritonitis. This is a surgical emergency with a high mortality risk. - Adhesion formation\n- Surgical or inflammatory causes of SBO may result in further adhesion formation, increasing the risk of recurrent obstructions. - Fistula formation\n- Chronic obstructions or associated diseases, such as Crohn disease, can lead to abnormal connections between bowel loops or other organs, complicating management. **Systemic Complications**\n- Sepsis and multiorgan failure\n- Bacterial translocation across ischemic or necrotic bowel walls can lead to bacteremia, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction. - Electrolyte imbalance and dehydration\n- Fluid sequestration within the bowel and vomiting lead to significant fluid and electrolyte losses, causing hypovolemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or acidosis (with bowel ischemia or necrosis). - Malnutrition\n- Prolonged obstruction, especially in chronic or partial cases, can result in malabsorption, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. **Postsurgical Complications**\n- **Anastomotic leak**\n- In cases requiring bowel resection, anastomotic leaks may occur, leading to peritonitis or abscess formation."

Deterrence and Patient Education\n**Deterrence Strategies**\nPreventing SBO focuses on reducing modifiable risk factors and implementing measures to lower recurrence. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery face a heightened risk of adhesional SBO, which constitutes the majority of cases. Using minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopy, can significantly decrease adhesion formation compared to open procedures. Additionally, adhesion barriers like sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose applied during surgery may further reduce the likelihood of adhesions. Early repair of abdominal wall hernias, particularly in high-risk individuals, can prevent incarcerated or strangulated hernias that often lead to SBO. Managing chronic medical conditions, such as Crohn disease or radiation enteritis, through adherence to prescribed treatment regimens can minimize complications like strictures and fistulas that predispose patients to obstruction. **Patient Education**\nEducating patients about SBO is essential for timely recognition and management of the condition. Individuals, especially those with prior abdominal surgeries, cancer, or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, should understand the symptoms and risk factors. Patients should be taught to recognize signs such as abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and an inability to pass stool or gas and to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur. Preventive measures, such as maintaining a balanced fiber-rich diet, can help avoid obstructions caused by constipation or bezoar formation. Those with a history of obstruction should avoid high-risk foods like persimmons or fibrous vegetables. Patients taking medications that impair bowel motility, such as opioids or anticholinergics, should discuss potential adjustments with their healthcare providers to reduce their risk. **Postoperative Education**\nPatients recovering from surgery for SBO require specific discharge instructions to prevent complications and ensure a smooth recovery."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nEffective management of SBO requires a collaborative, patient-centered approach that leverages the skills and expertise of an interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians are central in diagnosing SBO, ordering appropriate imaging, and determining surgical intervention needs. They must communicate clinical findings clearly, as well as anticipated management plans and possible complications, to other team members. Nurses are essential in monitoring patients\u2019 vital signs, fluid balance, and the progression of symptoms, ensuring early detection of complications like ischemia or perforation. They manage nasogastric tube care and educate patients about the condition and its treatment. Pharmacists contribute by optimizing fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and antimicrobial therapy, particularly when addressing sepsis or preparing for surgical intervention.\nCare coordination is pivotal in achieving optimal outcomes for patients with SBO. Clear and consistent communication among team members prevents delays in diagnosis or treatment. For example, radiologists provide timely and accurate imaging interpretation, which informs surgical versus nonoperative management decisions. In the perioperative setting, anesthesiologists work closely with surgeons to ensure patients are stabilized for surgery, while respiratory therapists assist patients with compromised pulmonary function due to abdominal distention. Social workers and case managers support discharge planning and facilitate access to follow-up care or resources for patients recovering from surgical intervention. This comprehensive strategy fosters a safety culture, improves patient outcomes, and enhances team performance by ensuring that every healthcare professional\u2019s expertise is integrated into a unified, patient-focused care plan."
