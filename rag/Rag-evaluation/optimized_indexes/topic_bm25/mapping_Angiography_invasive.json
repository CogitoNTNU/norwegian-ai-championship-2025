    "text": "Introduction\nMedical imaging has benefitted from a boom in innovation in the past 50 years, which has allowed for rapid development in the field of interventional radiology. Angiography is used to image anatomical and structural details of the vascular system by detecting contrast injected into a blood vessel and projecting this on a series of x-rays to outline the inner vessel wall and show flow through the lumen. Starting as a diagnostic tool, angiography underwent a technological transformation over the last century and became a basis for interventional therapy as well. Angiography, initially a static two-dimensional record of the vasculature on screen-films, has evolved to a real-time two-dimensional display of the vasculature on television screens, and three-dimensional reconstruction from computed tomographic scans. Angiography has many advantages as it achieves real-time, dynamic imaging using a traditional imaging device - such as x-rays or computed tomography (CT), and it also offers therapeutic options at the time of initial diagnosis. Conventional angiography is invasive. In addition to providing therapeutic options, invasive angiography remains the gold standard in diagnosing most intravascular pathologies. Advances in imaging technology in the last three decades have expanded the scope of angiography to include non-invasive techniques using CT and magnetic resonance imaging technologies. In CT angiography (CTA), intravenous contrast is administered via a peripheral vein, and triple-phase CT is usually acquired. CTA is based on high-resolution CT data acquisition, with subsequent angiographic two or three-dimensional reconstruction. Advances and adaptations of CTA principles have been of immense benefit to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Whereas this is an excellent first-line investigation and offers information regarding the surrounding soft tissues, it is less useful in investigating blood flow to the extremities due to the small diameter. Interventional angiography provides higher resolution imaging and can detect changes in the small vessels."

Anatomy and Physiology\nThe complete anatomy of the vascular system is beyond the scope of this article. Key anatomical structures relevant to angiography will be discussed. The aorta starts at the aortic root, which in healthy individuals measures up to 4.3 cm. The aorta gives off the left and right main coronary arteries at the level of the sinus of Valsalva. It then continues as the ascending aorta, before turning into the aortic arch. Three important branches originate from the arch:\n- The brachiocephalic trunk divides to form the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. - The left common carotid artery further divides to form the internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery, together with the vertebral artery, will form the circle of Wilis, while the external carotid artery gives off the superior thyroid artery, the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the lingual artery. Other branches of the external carotid artery include the facial artery, the occipital artery, the posterior auricular artery, the maxillary artery, and the superficial temporal artery\n- The left subclavian artery\nThe subclavian artery is divided into three sections by the scalenus anterior muscle. The first part gives off the vertebral artery, which supplies blood to the vertebrobasilar system and the circle of Willis. The other arteries that originate from the first part are the internal mammary artery and the thyrocervical trunk.

    "text": "Technique or Treatment\nAccess for angiography is gained via a large or medium-sized artery, and location varies according to the procedure. The femoral route is usually used as a retrograde approach for procedures involving the iliac vessels, the abdominal and thoracic aorta, the upper limbs, and the head and neck. Due to its large caliber, it allows for larger devices such as stents or occlusive aortic balloons. The radial approach is now commonly used in coronary angiography, as it comes with a lower risk of complications compared to the previous femoral or brachial routes. Larger size sheaths are easily accommodated via the femoral route, and often percutaneous suture devices and collagen plugs are used. For angiography of the lower limbs, an antegrade femoral approach or a popliteal approach is used. An appropriate catheter is introduced via the access site, using a system of guide wires, and advanced to the appropriate vessel depending on the particular procedure. A contrast medium is introduced to outline the vasculature distal to the catheter tip. The X-ray images taken may be still or fluoroscopic, using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) technique, which is obtained by taking the images at 2 to 3 frames per second. The degree of stenosis or other abnormalities is identified by visual assessment. Imaging of the thoracic aorta begins by looking at the aortic root, the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the proximal descending aorta. The patient's head is tilted to the right and in the chin-up position for better access to the branches. An image of the arch at 40\u00b0 LAO (left anterior oblique) is commonly acquired at the start of the procedure as it allows to describe the type of aortic arch which predicts the difficulty of the procedure, as type II and III arches make cannulation of the common carotid more difficult."

Complications\nThough overall complications related to angiography remain low, the risk of complications following conventional angiography is higher in the elderly, patients with reduced cardiac reserve, calcified non-compliant arteries, renal disease, and multiple comorbidities.\n**Minor Complications**\n- Bruising\n- Nausea\n- Pain at the puncture site\n- Minor allergic reactions like rash, itch, or hives\n- Transient deterioration in renal function\n- Transient hot flushes or burning sensation\n**Major Complications**\n- Significant bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm occur in \\<5% of angiograms, and 1 in 100 patients require overnight admission in the observation unit, while 1 in 500\u20131000 patients will require a second intervention or blood transfusion to correct the bleeding.\n- Significant allergic reaction (anaphylactoid reaction)\n- Acute renal failure\nContrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a substantial source of morbidity, which might require a brief period of renal replacement therapy. The essential preventive measures for contrast related complications include adequate peri-procedural hydration and use of minimal contrast volume. Cigarroa et al. estimated the maximal acceptable contrast dose (MACD) using the following equation: (5 x bodyweight in Kg) divided by serum creatinine in mg/dl; up to a maximum volume of 300ml. However, this formula is less useful in high-risk patients such as those with anemia, diabetes, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock, and it is infrequently used in clinical settings. Gurm et al. concluded that the ratio of contrast volume (CV) to the calculated creatinine clearance (CCC) of less than two is associated with a low incidence of CIN. In contrast, the risk of CIN is markedly increased when the ratio exceeds three."

    "text": "An image of the arch at 40\u00b0 LAO (left anterior oblique) is commonly acquired at the start of the procedure as it allows to describe the type of aortic arch which predicts the difficulty of the procedure, as type II and III arches make cannulation of the common carotid more difficult. Complications\nThough overall complications related to angiography remain low, the risk of complications following conventional angiography is higher in the elderly, patients with reduced cardiac reserve, calcified non-compliant arteries, renal disease, and multiple comorbidities.\n**Minor Complications**\n- Bruising\n- Nausea\n- Pain at the puncture site\n- Minor allergic reactions like rash, itch, or hives\n- Transient deterioration in renal function\n- Transient hot flushes or burning sensation\n**Major Complications**\n- Significant bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm occur in \\<5% of angiograms, and 1 in 100 patients require overnight admission in the observation unit, while 1 in 500\u20131000 patients will require a second intervention or blood transfusion to correct the bleeding.\n- Significant allergic reaction (anaphylactoid reaction)\n- Acute renal failure\nContrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a substantial source of morbidity, which might require a brief period of renal replacement therapy. The essential preventive measures for contrast related complications include adequate peri-procedural hydration and use of minimal contrast volume. Cigarroa et al. estimated the maximal acceptable contrast dose (MACD) using the following equation: (5 x bodyweight in Kg) divided by serum creatinine in mg/dl; up to a maximum volume of 300ml. However, this formula is less useful in high-risk patients such as those with anemia, diabetes, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock, and it is infrequently used in clinical settings. Gurm et al. concluded that the ratio of contrast volume (CV) to the calculated creatinine clearance (CCC) of less than two is associated with a low incidence of CIN. In contrast, the risk of CIN is markedly increased when the ratio exceeds three."
