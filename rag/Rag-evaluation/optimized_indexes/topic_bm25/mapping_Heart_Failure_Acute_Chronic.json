    "text": "Anatomy and Physiology\nLoop diuretics administered intravenously remain the first-line therapy for hospitalized ADHF patients. Loop diuretics inhibit Na+/2Cl-/K+ cotransporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which causes decreased sodium and chloride reabsorption and results in natriuresis and diuresis. Loop diuretics also increase the synthesis of prostaglandins, which cause renal and pulmonary vasodilation. This leads to a reduction in pulmonary wedge pressure. This overall causes improvement of dyspnea and decreases ventricular filling pressures.\nRecent studies have suggested that the lack of adequate decongestion achieved by loop diuretics is more common than previously known. In patients with renal insufficiency (as seen in >50% of HF patients), anions compete with receptor sites for tubular transporters, and these patients need higher diuretic doses to achieve the effect. As heart failure (HF) worsens, the dose-response curve for loop diuretics shifts downwards and to the right, causing a need for higher doses of diuretics to achieve the same effect. This is one of the mechanisms that can lead to an effect known as diuretic resistance in some patients. Dose escalation beyond a previously recognized dose ceiling or dose beyond the recommended maximum daily dose suggests diuretic resistance. Long-term administration of loop diuretics can cause a mechanism known as the \u201cbraking phenomenon.\u201d This results from extracellular volume contraction causing an overactivation of the RAAS and sympathetic responses and adaptive epithelial hypertrophy and hyperfunction in the distal nephron, resulting in reduced delivery of solute to the proximal tubule.\nThere are several strategies to overcome this diuretic resistance, one of them including ultrafiltration. Studies suggest that peripheral venovenous ultrafiltration is one of the most promising approaches in managing ADHF patients."

Studies suggest that peripheral venovenous ultrafiltration is one of the most promising approaches in managing ADHF patients. Complications\nAdverse events associated with UF include clotting of UF filters, transient discomfort at the venous access site, central venous catheter infection, catheter malfunction, hypotension, bleeding events, and renal injury. A very small percentage of patients had volume overload refractory to UF. Early studies suggest that UF is unsafe. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Siddiqui et al. concluded that UF is safe and effective in ADHF and that there were no significant adverse events in UF compared to IV diuretics. There were fewer bleeding events with UF than with standard therapy. The increased events of hypotension in UF noted in the studies were clinically insignificant. In addition, the incidence of acute kidney injury in UF and diuretic therapy were comparable. The Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (CARRESS-HF) trial by Bart et al. compared the effect of UF with diuretic therapy on renal function in patients with heart failure who have persistent volume overload and renal function that is declining. The study found that, although UF is associated with a higher increase in serum creatine initially, long-term, the serum creatinine is lower when compared to patients on standard diuretic therapy."

Clinical Significance\nUF therapy is a mechanical modality of fluid removal. It reduces central venous pressure (CVP) without impacting circulating volume. This is accomplished by creating a hydrostatic pressure gradient that triggers a mechanical extraction of fluid across a filter which subsequently results in the separation and removal of isotonic plasma water. Studies show that it can be used effectively to reduce volume overload in patients resistant to conventional diuretic therapy. The UNLOAD (UF versus Intravenous Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for ADHF) trial found that UF is not only an effective alternative therapy for refractory HF but also safely produces greater weight and fluid loss than intravenous diuretics and reduces 90-day HF readmissions and cumulative hospital readmissions. Three recent meta-analyses evaluating the comparative outcomes of UF versus conventional diuretic therapy in reducing volume overload in patients with ADHF found that patients that were able to tolerate UF had a significant reduction in volume overload and weight in comparison to conventional diuretics alone.\nUF can show great benefits for patients in ADHF refractory to standard therapy with diuretics. It also causes iso-osmotic volume loss without changing or creating any electrolyte abnormalities. In addition, it can lead to maximum sodium loss per unit of volume removal compared to IV diuretics. UF can also lead to change in the neurohormonal milieu, which may have clinical significance in heart disease, and it has also been shown to restore diuretic sensitivity."

Introduction\nHeart failure is a growing public health problem that is now the most common cause of hospitalizations in the United States among patients aged 65 and older. The growing prevalence of heart failure is primarily attributed to an aging population and a rise in risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Healthcare professionals should be familiar with the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of heart failure because of the morbidity, mortality, and projected increased prevalence of the condition.\nHeart failure is a clinical syndrome and encompasses a constellation of symptoms secondary to impaired cardiac function; there are numerous etiologies for impaired heart function. The causative factors for heart failure are generally divided into structural or functional categories. Patients who have heart failure can also be classified based on the stage or degree of heart failure and symptoms, including episodes of acute exacerbation and pulmonary edema. Heart failure can be divided into 2 broad categories: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpE) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The incidence of HFpEF increases with age, and most cases of heart failure in older patients are due to HFpEF.\nAcute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common and potentially fatal cause of cardiac dysfunction that can present with acute respiratory distress. In ADHF, pulmonary edema and the rapid accumulation of fluid within the interstitial and alveolar spaces lead to significant dyspnea and respiratory decompensation. There are many different causes of pulmonary edema, though cardiogenic pulmonary edema is usually a result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures."

Etiology\nIn the United States, there are many causes of heart failure\u2014the most common of which is coronary artery disease. Identifying the risk factors for heart failure is important because this condition is preventable. Acknowledging the preventable nature of heart failure, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have updated their classification systems to identify patients without structural abnormalities early, enabling timely and appropriate treatment. Treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension concurrently in alignment with contemporary guidelines reduces the risk of heart failure by approximately 50%. **Risk Factors for Heart Failure**\n- Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n- Connective tissue disorders (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus)\n- Endocrine disorders (ie, diabetes mellitus, thyroid function disorders, growth hormone deficiency)\n- Hypertension\n- High-output conditions (ie, anemia, Paget disease)\n- Valvular heart disease\n- Metabolic causes (ie, obesity)\n- Myocarditis (ie, secondary to human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, medications, or viruses)\n- Infiltrative disorders (ie, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)\n- Peripartum cardiomyopathy\n- Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)\n- Valvular heart disease\n- Medications (ie, amphetamines, anabolic steroids)\n- Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy\n- Toxins (ie, cocaine, alcohol)\n- Nutritional deficiency (ie, L-carnitine deficiency, thiamine)\n**Risk Factors for Acute Heart Failure and Flash Pulmonary Edema**\nAcute heart failure is the worsening of heart failure symptoms to the point that the patient requires intensification of therapy and intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure can be dramatic and rapid in onset, such as flash pulmonary edema, or more gradual with the worsening of symptoms over time until a critical point of decompensation is reached."

Epidemiology\nHeart failure is a major public health problem. This condition is now the most common cause of hospitalization in the United States among patients aged 65 and older, and approximately 91,500 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year. The increasing prevalence of heart failure is most likely secondary to the aging of the population, increased risk factors, better outcomes for acute coronary syndrome survivors, and a reduction in mortality secondary to improved management of chronic conditions. Further, incidence rates for heart failure increase with age for both sexes. The lifetime risk of developing heart failure for those 40 and older residing in the United States is 20%. The risk and incidence of heart failure continue to increase from 20 per 1000 people aged 60 to 65 to over 80 per 1000 people aged 80 and older. There are also differences in risk for heart failure based on the population, with Black individuals having the highest risk and greater 5-year mortality for heart failure than the White population in the United States. The European Society of Cardiology states that the prevalence of heart failure is 1% to 2% and rises to greater than 10% in the population of those aged 70 and older. **Heart Failure Statistics**\n- Heart failure survival has improved over time, yet the absolute 5-year mortality rates from diagnosis for heart failure have remained at 50%\n- Heart failure is the number 1 diagnosis among all hospitalizations, and the cost of annual heart failure care exceeds $30 billion every year. - Most of the cost spent on heart failure patients is for hospitalizations and readmissions."

The presentation of heart failure may vary based on each patient; therefore, it is essential to consider the following during the history and physical:\n- **History:** If the patient has a history of past heart failure, ask if this is the same presentation as when they had previous episodes of heart failure or an acute decompensation. - **Symptom Causes:** Consider noncardiac and other causes of the patient's symptoms, as it is important to ensure a broad differential diagnosis and avoid anchoring bias, premature closer, and diagnostic inertia. - **Heart failure symptoms:**\n- Increasing dyspnea (on exertion, on lying flat or at rest, exercise intolerance)\n- Increasing leg swelling, ascites, edema\n- Increased body weight\n- Palpitations, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (associated with worse prognosis)\n- Chest pain, fatigue\n- Duration of Illness, recent or frequent hospitalizations for heart failure\n- Medications or diet changes\n- Anorexia, cachexia, or early satiety (associated with worse prognosis)\n- Symptoms of transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism (indicate a possible need for anticoagulation)\n- Social history and family history (to assess for possible familial cardiomyopathy, alcohol, or other cause\n- Travel history (exposure risk to some tropical diseases)\n**Physical Examination**\nThe physical examination should include the following:\n- **Vital signs:** Assess blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are important in helping develop and refine the differential diagnosis and help the healthcare professional tailor the physical examination better. - **Check patient weight:** The patient's weight and body mass index should be checked during each office visit. The information can be used to track response to treatment and the potential progression of heart failure or acute decompensated heart failure. Losing weight can also be a warning sign of worsening heart failure."

When a patient is in acute or decompensated heart failure, our focus is on expeditious identification and treatment of life threats. Different classification schemes are available when evaluating chronic heart failure. The classification scheme used to categorize the type and degree of heart failure is based on the presentation and affects the treatment and prognosis of the condition. Heart failure classification schemes are generally based on 1 of the following:\n- Anatomic findings (ie, heart failure with different degrees of ejection fraction)\n- The chamber of the heart involved (including functional)\n- Symptoms of the patient\nAll heart failure patients should also be classified based on the American College Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) stages of heart failure, a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification. **ACCF/AHA Stages of Heart Failure**\nThe risk of heart failure defines the ACC/AHA stages of heart failure, the presence of active heart failure, and whether structural heart disease is present.

Ordering multiple routine tests should be avoided in all patients with heart failure. Basic tests that should merit consideration for all patients evaluated for heart failure are the following:\n- Serum electrolytes and kidney function\n- Complete blood count\n- Lipid level\n- Liver function tests\n- Troponin level if there is concern that myocardial injury is the cause of symptoms\n- Thyroid-stimulating hormone\n- An electrocardiogram\nOther tests that may be considered based on the severity and classification of the patient's condition are:\n- **Chest x-rays** assess for signs of pulmonary congestion or edema in acute decompensated heart failure (see Image.

Treatment / Management\n**Treatment of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema**\nThe focus of treatment for patients with heart failure is dependent on the severity of the symptoms and the stage of heart failure. When patients are in acute decompensated heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, the most important focus for therapeutic interventions is the enhancement of hemodynamic status through the reduction of vascular congestion and improving preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility. In flash pulmonary edema, where there is a rapid onset of heart failure, the initial management and treatment goals are very similar to acute decompensated heart failure. Treatment options for acute decompensated heart failure and flash pulmonary edema are as follows:\n- **ABCs:** As with all patients, it is crucial to assess airway, breathing, and circulation in the initial evaluation and initiate appropriate management based on patient status. In decompensated heart failure, patients should be hooked up to cardiorespiratory monitoring, have IV access and oxygen administered if hypoxic or tachypnoeic, have an electrocardiogram performed, and have labs drawn based on clinical suspicion and patient condition. - **Diuretics:** Most patients presenting with heart failure have a form of volume overload. AHA and ACC guidelines recommend intravenous loop diuretic administration to treat fluid overload. Intravenous administration is preferred over oral diuretics to maximize the bioavailability of the medication and clinical effects. Furosemide is a common treatment for acute decompensated heart failure and flash-pulmonary edema because of its anti-vasoconstrictor and diuretic effects. - **Vasodilators:** Patients with acute decompensated heart failure with hypertension and acute pulmonary edema can benefit from treatment with vasodilators."

Most vasodilators promote smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation to reduce preload and afterload through the cyclic guanine monophosphate pathway. Vasodilation relieves pulmonary vascular congestion and improves left ventricular preload and afterload. The common vasodilator medications used are nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside. - ```\n* Nitroglycerin can be given transdermally, sublingually, or intravenously, depending on the patient's condition. In acute decompensation or flash pulmonary edema, nitroglycerin is best given sublingually or intravenously to allow for titration of effect. ```\n- Sodium nitroprusside is only given intravenously. Patients with renal dysfunction treated with sodium nitroprusside may need to have their cyanide levels monitored. Check with your pharmacist about guidelines for monitoring cyanide levels. - **Ionotropic Medications:** Additional treatment options for patients in cardiogenic shock or who have signs of end-organ dysfunction secondary to hypoperfusion. Inotropes should only be used as a treatment adjunct in acute decompensated heart failure since data from the ADHERE registry suggest increased mortality with use. Dobutamine and mllrinone are 2 inotropes that are more commonly used. Dobutamine is preferable for patients who are beta-blocker-naive, while milrinone is preferred for patients previously taking oral beta blockers who experience acute decompensation. - **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP):** These are noninvasive methods of respiratory support to treat respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. The use of CPAP and BIPAP has reduced the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in heart failure patients with acute respiratory decompensation. In situations where CPAP and BIPAP are ineffective in improving the patient's respiratory status, early intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered to help prevent further decompensation and progression of symptoms. - **Coronary revascularization:** When performed in appropriately selected patients, revascularization can reduce mortality and morbidity by improving diastolic and systolic dysfunction."

Also important to consider are other potentially life-threatening causes of heart failure.\n- **Sepsis:** Patients with sepsis are at risk of multiorgan system failure. Approximately 1 out of 3 patients with sepsis present with reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction reduced ejection fracture, and 1 out of 2 patients with sepsis have left ventricular or right ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis can result in significantly increased mortality. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with an increased mortality risk of 80%, and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with a 60% increased mortality.\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome:** This condition is characterized by acute respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, which could potentially mimic flash pulmonary edema.\n- **Neurological causes:** Hemispheric and hippocampal brain infarcts are associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Infarct of certain areas of the brain tissue can result in a sympathetic storm, and loss of vasomotor homeostasis precipitates neurogenic pulmonary edema (see **Image.** Key Features in the Pathophysiology of Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema).\n- **Pulmonary embolism:** While a massive pulmonary embolism can cause acute cardiac dysfunction secondary to obstruction of blood flow, post-pulmonary embolism syndrome may also present with heart failure-type symptoms. Postpulmonary embolism syndrome and reduced exercise tolerance have been associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, arrhythmia, valvular dysfunction, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n- **Acute coronary syndrome:** Acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction is a common cause of acute decompensated heart failure."

Despite advances made in heart failure treatments, the prognosis of the condition worsens over time, resulting in frequent hospital admissions and premature death. Results from one recent study showed that patients recently diagnosed with new-onset heart failure had a mortality rate of 20.2% at 1 year and 52.6% at 5 years. The 1- and 5-year mortality rates also increase significantly based on the patient's age.

The mortality rates were similar when evaluated across different cardiac ejection fractions.\nThe prognosis is worse for those with heart failure who are hospitalized; those with heart failure commonly require repeat hospitalizations and develop an intolerance for standard treatments as the disease progresses.

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nTreating heart failure and acute decompensated heart failure is challenging despite the use of maximal evidence-based therapy based on the stage of heart failure. Given the limited effect of current treatment strategies on the progression of heart failure, it is important to identify ways to maximize patient outcomes and quality of care by the interprofessional team. Patients at potential risk for heart failure based on comorbidities or other identified risk factors should receive appropriate evidence-based preventative counseling and treatments. When applicable, the primary care clinician who may be the most involved in managing the patient's risk factors should consult other specialists, including cardiologists, endocrinologists, pharmacists, cardiology nurses, and nutritionists, to ensure they provide the best advice and treatment for their patients. Nurses monitor patients, provide education, and collaborate with clinicians and the healthcare team to improve outcomes. Pharmacists review medications, inform patients and their families about potential adverse events, and monitor compliance. Given the propensity of patients with heart failure to require recurrent admissions, often because of non heart failure-related conditions, the collaboration between inpatient and outpatient services can be of benefit in the continuity of care and help promote improved outcomes."

Introduction\nHeart failure (HF), as defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. HF is a common disorder worldwide with a high morbidity and mortality rate. With an estimated prevalence of 26 million people worldwide, CHF contributes to increased healthcare costs, reduces functional capacity, and significantly affects quality of life. Accurately diagnosing and effectively treating the disease is essential to prevent recurrent hospitalizations, decrease morbidity and mortality, and enhance patient outcomes. The etiology of HF is variable and extensive. Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of HF. The general management of HF aims to relieve systemic and pulmonary congestion and stabilize hemodynamic status, regardless of the cause. The treatment of HF requires a multifaceted approach involving patient education, optimal medication administration, and decreasing acute exacerbations. Per the recent ACC/AHA guidelines for HF 2022, patients with HF are classified based on left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas clinical and laboratory parameters are integrated to stage patients. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification stratifies and defines the functional capacity and severity of HF symptoms. This system is subjectively determined by clinicians and is widely used in clinical practice to direct therapy. Management of patients depends on the classification and staging of the disease."

The following parameters are used to classify HF based on LVEF:\n- **HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** : LV EF \u226440%\n- **HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction** : LVEF 41% to 49% and evidence of HF (spontaneous or provokable elevated cardiac biomarkers or elevated filling pressures)\n- **HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** : LVEF \u226550% and evidence of HF (spontaneous or provokable elevated cardiac biomarkers or elevated filling pressures)\n- **HF with improved ejection fraction** : LV EF >40%, with previously documented LV EF \u226440%\nThe ACC/AHA Stages of HF are as follows:\n- Stage A: At risk for HF. No current or past symptoms, structural heart disease, or evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers, but risk factors are present. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxic medications, or having a genetic variant for cardiomyopathy. - Stage B: Pre-HF. Patients have no signs or symptoms of HF but have risk factors and structural heart disease, evidence of elevated filling pressures (by invasive or noninvasive assessment), or persistently elevated cardiomarkers in the absence of other reasons for elevated markers, like chronic kidney disease or myocarditis. - Stage C: Symptomatic HF. Patients with current or past history of HF symptoms. - Stage D: Advanced HF. Patients with refractory symptoms that interfere with daily life or recurrent hospitalization despite targeted guideline-directed medical therapy. For stage C and stage D HF patients, the following NYHA classification of HF symptoms should be used:\n- **Class I** : Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity\n- **Class II** : Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity\n- **Class III** : Symptom onset with minimal activity\n- ```\n* Class III a: No dyspnea at rest\n```\n- Class III b: Recent onset of dyspnea at rest\n- **Class IV** : Symptoms at rest"

    "text": "Etiology\n**Heart Failure Etiologies**\nThe etiologies of HF are extensive, though coronary artery disease (CAD) causing ischemic heart disease is the most common cause. Every attempt should be made to identify causative factors to help guide treatment strategies. The etiologies can be broadly classified as intrinsic heart disease and pathologies that are infiltrative, congenital, valvular, myocarditis-related, high-output failure, and secondary to systemic disease. These classifications have significant overlap. The 4 most common etiologies responsible for about two-thirds of HF cases are ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertensive heart disease, and rheumatic heart disease. Higher-income countries have higher rates of ischemic heart disease and COPD; lower-income countries have higher rates of hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and myocarditis. **Ischemic heart disease**\nIschemic heart disease is by far the most common cause of HF worldwide. Ischemia leads to a lack of blood flow to heart muscles, reducing the EF. Incidence is increasing in developing countries as they adopt a more Western diet and lifestyle, and improved medical care decreases the infectious burden in these countries (myocarditis is often infection-related.) **Valvular heart disease**\nValvular heart disease is another common intrinsic heart condition that can cause HF. Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in children and young adults worldwide. It is caused by an immune response to group A Streptococcus and primarily causes mitral and aortic stenosis. Age-related degeneration is the most common overall cause of valvular disease, and the aortic valve is the most commonly affected. Women are more likely to experience mitral valve rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse, while men are more likely to suffer from aortic valve diseases such as regurgitation or stenosis. Endocarditis is also more common in men. **Hypertension**\nHypertension causes HF even in the absence of CAD or ischemic heart disease."

Endocarditis is also more common in men. **Hypertension**\nHypertension causes HF even in the absence of CAD or ischemic heart disease. High blood pressure causes mechanical stress by increased afterload and neurohormonal changes that increase ventricular mass. Hypertension is also strongly associated with other comorbidities for HF development, and aggressively treating hypertension is shown to lower the incidence of HF. **Cardiomyopathy**\nCardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by enlarged ventricles with impaired function not related to secondary causes such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, or congenital heart disease. The most common types of cardiomyopathies are hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and left ventricular noncompaction. In addition to CHF, cardiomyopathy can present as arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, further compelling the identification of underlying disorders. Many of these conditions have a genetic basis, and a detailed family history of sudden cardiac death, especially in first-degree relatives older than 35 years, should be taken. Over 50 identified genes contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy alone. Genetic determinants have variable phenotypic expression, and many nongenetic factors also affect the clinical symptoms. Some of these factors include diabetes, toxic exposure, or pregnancy. Fabry disease is a rare glycogen storage disease that can cause CHF symptoms through a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pattern. **Inflammatory cardiomyopathy**\nInflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis along with ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. The most common cause is viral infection. Other etiologies are bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infections; toxic substances or drugs; and immune-mediated diseases. Chagas disease is caused by _Trypanosoma cruzi,_ which is endemic in Latin America \\_\\_ and commonly causes myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and CHF. Other viral causes of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy include adenoviruses, enteroviruses, herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Viruses can also activate autoimmune myocarditis, including HIV, hepatitis C virus, influenzas A and B, and coronaviruses (including COVID-19). When associated with CHF, these conditions tend to have a poor prognosis."

When associated with CHF, these conditions tend to have a poor prognosis. **Infiltrative cardiomyopathies**\nInfiltrative cardiomyopathies cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern (similar to the genetically determined restrictive cardiomyopathy variant), which is notable for normal ventricular systolic function but with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling dynamics. This is often associated with a high E/A ratio showing increased early filling and delayed late filling. Cardiac amyloidosis results from misfolded protein deposits in the heart; this leads to cardiomyocyte separation, cellular toxicity, and tissue stiffness. Patients are preload dependent and are prone to symptomatic hypotension. Currently, tamifidis is the only medication known to prevent cardiac amyloidosis. It prevents, but does not reverse, amyloid deposition. Its high cost is also a limiting factor. Sarcoidosis is an acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by conduction defects and arrhythmias caused by the formation of granulomas. The most common cardiac manifestation is CHF. Due to the associated conduction abnormalities, beta-blockers must be used with caution. Cardiac hemochromatosis is present in 15% to 20% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition initially presents with a restrictive pattern but develops into biventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy physiology can develop hypotension when treated with traditional CHF medications due to preload dependence, so caution should be used to avoid systemic hypoperfusion. **Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy**\nTakotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (colloquially broken-heart syndrome) is an underrecognized cause of HF, which causes transient left-ventricular wall abnormalities that are not localized to a specific vascular territory. It has several proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms, including coronary vasospasm, microcirculatory dysfunction, and increased sympathetic nervous system activation. This condition is treated with medications typical for HF with the addition of antithrombotic medications in certain clinical situations with wall motion abnormalities. Recognized cases increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. **Peripartum cardiomyopathy**\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of maternal mortality. During pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 20% to 30% due to increased heart rate and stroke volume."

During pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 20% to 30% due to increased heart rate and stroke volume. It presents with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction during late pregnancy, postpartum, or up to several months after delivery. There is likely an underlying genetic component, and it is more common in women with advanced maternal age, Black race, and multifetal pregnancies. If wall motion abnormalities are present, anticoagulation is essential due to the hypercoagulable state caused by pregnancy. Recovery is variable by global region and inversely correlates with lowered EF. **Obesity**\nObesity is a leading cause of CHF in patients younger than 40 years, according to the \"Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity\" (the CHARM study). The \"obesity paradox\" described elsewhere has significant study flaws and is derived from older data. Up to 10% of CHF cases are thought to be attributable to obesity alone. Patients with obesity are more likely to have HFpEF, possibly secondary to adipose-produced cytokines, eg, IL-1b, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1. Adipose tissue also degrades natriuretic peptides. **Tachycardia and arrhythmia**\nTachycardia and arrhythmia can induce a low-output CHF state. Dilation of all cardiac chambers and preservation or thinning of biventricular wall thickness is usually noted. Electrophysiologic changes accompany this, including prolonged duration and decreased amplitude of action potentials in the myocytes. All of these factors induce the typical neurohormonal response causing CHF. With rate control, these changes are often reversible due to myocardial hibernation. **Thyrotoxicosis**\nThyrotoxicosis is a rare cause of HF despite initiating a hyperdynamic circulatory state. This may be partially due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, causing sodium and water retention, as well as upregulation of erythropoietin-stimulating agent, both of which will cause increased blood volume. Sustained tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation can also cause CHF. **High-output cardiac failure**\nHigh-output cardiac failure can be associated with thiamine deficiency, which is a rare condition found primarily among patients who are elderly, homeless, or have alcohol abuse disorder."

Epidemiology\nThe global magnitude of the disease cannot be accurately assessed given the significant differences in geographical distribution, assessment methods, lack of imaging modalities, and nonadherence to the uniform staging and diagnosis of the disease. Approximately 1.2 million hospitalizations were due to CHF in 2017, with an increase in the percentage of patients with HFpEF compared to HFrEF. By some reports, the incidence rate has plateaued; however, the prevalence increases as more patients receive therapy. Moreover, treatment has not translated to improved quality of life or a decrease in the number of hospitalizations for patients with CHF. According to the Global Health Data Exchange registry, the current worldwide prevalence of CHF is 64.34 million cases. This translates to 9.91 million years lost due to disability and 346.17 billion United States dollars in healthcare expenditure. Age is a major determinant of HF. Regardless of the cause or the definition used to classify patients with HF, the prevalence of HF increases steeply with age. The Framingham Heart Study showed CHF prevalence to be 8 per 1000 males aged 50 to 59 years, with an increase to 66 per 1000 males aged 80 to 89. The incidence of HF in men doubles with each 10-year age increase after the age of 65, whereas in women, for the same age cohort, the incidence triples. Men have higher rates of heart disease and CHF than women worldwide. The global registry also notes a predilection for a race with a 25% higher prevalence of HF in Black patients than in White patients. HF is still the primary cause of hospitalization in the elderly population and accounts for 8.5% of cardiovascular-related deaths in the United States."

HF is still the primary cause of hospitalization in the elderly population and accounts for 8.5% of cardiovascular-related deaths in the United States. Pathophysiology\nHF is a progressive disease. Any acute insult to cardiac structure or acute alteration secondary to genetic mutation, cardiac tissue infiltration, ischemia, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, or acute myocardial injury may initiate the compensatory mechanism, which, once exhausted, results in maladaptation. In the initial stages of CHF, several compensatory mechanisms attempt to maintain cardiac output and meet the systemic demands. The chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in reduced beta-receptor responsiveness and adrenaline stores. This results in changes in myocyte regeneration, myocardial hypertrophy, and myocardial hypercontractility. The increased sympathetic drive also results in the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system, systemic vasoconstriction, and sodium retention. In addition, the RAAS system releases angiotensin II, which has been shown to increase myocardial cellular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, contributing to myocardial remodeling. A decrease in cardiac output stimulates the neuroendocrine system by releasing epinephrine, norepinephrine, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and vasopressin. These mediators cause vasoconstriction, leading to increased afterload. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases, which causes an increase in cytosolic calcium in the myocytes. This increases myocardial contractility and further prevents myocardial relaxation. Increased afterload and myocardial contractility, combined with impaired myocardial relaxation, increase myocardial oxygen demand. This paradoxical need for increased cardiac output to meet myocardial demand eventually leads to myocardial cell death and apoptosis. As apoptosis continues, a decrease in cardiac output with increased demand leads to a perpetuating cycle of increased neurohumoral stimulation and maladaptive hemodynamic and myocardial responses. The loss of myocytes decreases EF (cardiac contractility), which leads to incomplete LV emptying. Increased LV volume and pressure cause pulmonary congestion."

The loss of myocytes decreases EF (cardiac contractility), which leads to incomplete LV emptying. Increased LV volume and pressure cause pulmonary congestion. Renal hypoperfusion causes the release of antidiuretic hormone, further potentiating sodium and water retention. Increased central venous and intraabdominal pressure causes reduced renal blood flow, further decreasing GFR. Decompensated CHF is characterized by peripheral vasoconstriction and increased preload delivery to the overburdened heart. The natriuretic peptides BNP and ANP are secreted but are ineffective in counteracting the excess sodium and water retention. Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down several hormones, including BNP, ANP, and bradykinin; it targets several novel therapeutics. Neprilysin is always used with an angiotensin receptor blocker because it increases angiotensin II levels, and when administered with an ACE inhibitor, it causes significant angioedema. Causes of CHF are split about equally between HFrEF and HFpEF but require different treatment plans. In HFpEF, myocardial relaxation decreases, and the stiffness of the ventricle increases due to an increase in ventricular afterload. This perpetuates a similar maladaptive hemodynamic compensation and leads to progressive HF. Patients with HFpEF tend to be older, female, and hypertensive. Atrial fibrillation and anemia are also more likely comorbid conditions. Some evidence has demonstrated that the prognosis is worse than those with HFrEF. However, appropriate targets may not have been identified for optimal therapeutic interventions."

Some evidence has demonstrated that the prognosis is worse than those with HFrEF. However, appropriate targets may not have been identified for optimal therapeutic interventions. History and Physical\n**Clinical History**\nThe diagnosis and classification of HF are primarily based on the presence and severity of symptoms and physical exam findings. A detailed history of symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and functional capacity is imperative to treat the patient adequately. Acute CHF presents primarily with signs of congestion and may also present with organ hypoperfusion or cardiogenic shock. The most commonly reported symptom is shortness of breath. This must be classified as exertional, positional (orthopnea), and acute or chronic. Other commonly reported symptoms of CHF include chest pain, anorexia, and exertional fatigue. Anorexia is due to hepatic congestion, bowel edema, and reduced blood flow to splanchnic circulation. Some patients may present with a recumbent cough due to orthopnea. Patients may also experience abdominal discomfort due to hepatic congestion or ascites. Patients with arrhythmias can present with palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Another symptom that increases morbidity is edema, especially of the lower extremities. This can limit mobility and balance; total body water and weight increases of >20 lbs are not uncommon. While patients with acute HF present with overt respiratory distress, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, patients with chronic heart failure tend to curtail their physical activity; hence, symptoms may be obscured. Identifying triggers of acute decompensation, including recent infection, noncompliance with cardiac medications, use of NSAIDs, or increased salt intake, is essential. **Physical Examination Findings**\nThe findings on physical examination vary with the stage and acuity of the disease. Patients may have isolated symptoms of left-sided HF, right-sided HF, or a combination of both."

Patients may have isolated symptoms of left-sided HF, right-sided HF, or a combination of both. The general appearance of patients with severe CHF or those with acutely decompensated HF includes anxiety, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Patients with chronic decompensated HF can appear cachexic. On chest examination, the classical finding of pulmonary rales translates to heart failure of moderate-to-severe intensity. Wheezing may be present in acute decompensated heart failure. As the severity of pulmonary congestion increases, frothy and blood-tinged sputum may be seen. Notably, the absence of rales does not exclude pulmonary congestion. Jugular venous distention is another classical finding that must be assessed in all patients with HF. In patients with elevated left-sided filling pressures, hepatojugular reflux (sustained increase in JVP of >4 cm after applying pressure over the liver with the patient lying at a 45\u00b0 angle) is often seen. Patients with stage D HF may show signs of poor perfusion, including hypotension, reduced capillary refill, cold extremities, poor mentation, and reduced urine output. There may be pulsus alternans (an alternating weak and strong pulse), suggestive of severe ventricular dysfunction. The pulse can be irregular in the presence of atrial fibrillation or ectopic beats. Some degree of peripheral edema is present with most HF. Weight gain is another method for assessing volume retention, and precise daily weights can be a useful monitoring tool. Precordial findings in patients with HF include an S3 gallop, or displaced apex beat (dilated heart). There may be murmurs of associated valvular lesions such as the pan-systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation, systolic ejection murmur of aortic stenosis, or early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. Patients with pulmonary hypertension may have palpable or loud P2 or parasternal heave. Patients with congenital heart disease may also have associated clubbing, cyanosis, and splitting of the second heart sound. An S3 gallop is the most significant and early finding associated with HF. Patients with hypertensive heart disease may have an S4 or loud A2."

Evaluation\nA comprehensive assessment is required when evaluating a patient with HF. This includes a complete blood count and iron, renal, and liver profiles. Patients require further investigations after the basic metabolic and blood panel, depending on the etiology and clinical stage. **Laboratory Studies**\nLaboratory investigations recommended in patients with HF include:\n- **Complete blood count (CBC)** : A CBC may suggest anemia or leukocytosis suggestive of an infection triggering CHF. - **Renal profile** : A complete renal profile is necessary for all patients with HF. It indicates the degree of renal injury associated with HF and guides medication choice. Determining a patient's baseline renal function before initiating medications, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, or diuretics, is essential. Serum sodium level has prognostic value as a predictor of mortality in patients with chronic HF. \"The Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure\" (OPTIME-CHF) trial demonstrated a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as 30-day mortality in patients with HF who presented with hyponatremia. - **Live enzymes** : An assessment of liver function is usually performed. Hepatic congestion secondary to HF may result in elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). - **Urine studies** : Urine studies can be useful in diagnosis. If amyloidosis is suspected, urine and serum electrophoresis and monoclonal light chain assays should be performed. Bone scintigraphy can be performed if clinical suspicion is high despite negative testing for light chains. - **Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** : BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-ProBNP) levels can aid in differentiating cardiac from noncardiac causes of dyspnea in patients with ambiguous presentations."

BNP is an independent predictor of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and is used to assess mortality risk in patients with HF. BNP levels correlate with NYHA classification, and the utility is primarily used as a marker to evaluate treatment efficacy. NT-ProBNP is the chemically inert N-terminal fragment of BNP and has a longer half-life. The ratio of NT-ProBNP/BNP varies depending on underlying comorbidities and may be a useful tool in the future. In patients with a clear clinical presentation of HF, natriuretic peptides should not be used to drive treatment plans. Clinicians should remember that BNP and NT-ProBNP levels can be elevated in patients with renal dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and older patients. Conversely, BNP levels can be falsely low in patients with obesity, hypothyroidism, and advanced HF (due to myocardial fibrosis). - **Cardiac enzymes** : Troponin-I or T suggests ongoing myocardial injury when persistently elevated and predicts adverse outcomes and mortality. **Additional Diagnostic Studies**\n**Electrocardiogram**\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) may show evidence of prior infarction, chamber enlargement, intraventricular conduction delay, or arrhythmia. This study may also give clues to specific etiologies. A low voltage and pseudo infarction pattern of ECG is seen in cardiac amyloidosis. An epsilon wave is seen in ARVC. ECG also suggests the presence of ventricular desynchrony, with a QRS duration of more than 120 msec, predicting the patient's response to device therapy for HF. **Chest radiographs**\nChest radiographs are used to assess the degree of pulmonary congestion and cardiac contour (to determine the presence of cardiomegaly). Findings indicative of CHF on chest radiographs include enlarged cardiac silhouette, edema at the lung bases, and vascular congestion (see **Image**. Congestive Heart Failure, Radiograph). In florid HF, Kerley B lines may be seen on chest radiographs. The absence of these findings in patients with a suggestive clinical presentation does not rule out CHF."

It quantifies right and left ventricular function, denotes structural abnormalities in cardiac chambers and valves, and helps visualize focal wall motion abnormalities. However, in patients with severe obesity, pregnancy, or mechanical ventilation, it may be challenging to obtain adequate acoustic windows. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an alternative for these patients. To obtain adequate echocardiographic images, adequate rate control is necessary in patients with tachyarrhythmias. In patients with severe LV dysfunction, M-mode echocardiography may show increased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), decreased fractional shortening, increased E-point septal separation, or B-bump or notching of the mitral valve. **Cardiac catheterization**\nCardiac catheterization is often required for diagnosing ischemic cardiomyopathy and can be helpful in accurately evaluating intracardiac pressures, eg, left ventricular end-diastolic or pulmonary artery pressures. **Computed tomography**\nComputed tomography (CT) may be used for the assessment of coronary artery disease in a young patient with ventricular dysfunction (older patients are likely to have baseline calcifications). CT may also be used in patients with congenital heart diseases causing HF. Cardiac CT may help detect tumors causing HF. CT may also be used to evaluate stent patency and graft. **Myocardial perfusion imaging**\nSPECT-myocardial perfusion imaging helps define the presence of ischemia in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular dysfunction and not undergoing coronary angiography. This study is particularly useful for assessing CAD in patients with no history of ischemia but elevated troponin. ECG-gated myocardial perfusion imaging evaluates LVEF, regional wall motion, and regional wall thickening. EF measurement with this study may be affected in patients with an irregular heart rate, low count density, and extracardiac radiotracer uptake. ECG-gated images are also valuable for recognizing artifactual defects seen on SPECT imaging, eg, breast tissue and diaphragmatic attenuation."

It helps with the precise evaluation of volume, chamber sizes, and ventricular function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also assesses the stage of valvular heart disease in detail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also helps evaluate complex congenital heart diseases.

Treatment / Management\nThe goal of therapy for chronic HF is to improve symptoms and quality of life, decrease hospitalizations, and improve cardiac mortality. Pharmacologic treatment aims to control symptoms and to initiate and escalate drugs that reduce mortality and morbidity in HF. Management for the respective stages of HF is outlined by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. **Stage A Heart Failure Management**\nThe recommended treatment for stage A (at-risk for HF) HF include:\n- In patients with hypertension, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be used for the management of hypertension. - In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors are indicated to reduce HF hospitalizations. - Lifestyle modifications, including healthy eating, physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and avoidance of smoking, are indicated. - Prognostication scores are recommended for patients with HF to estimate the risk of future HF events. Examples include the Framingham Heart Failure Risk Score (1999), Health ABC Heart Failure Score (2008), ARIC Risk Score (2012), and PCP-HF score (2019). - Optimal management of cardiovascular diseases in patients known to have CAD should be implemented. - Patients at risk for HF due to exposure to cardiotoxic medications (eg, chemotherapy) should be managed with an interprofessional approach. - Natriuretic peptide screening and periodic evaluation should be performed. **Stage B Heart Failure Management**\nManagement of Stage B (pre-HF) is focused on preventing clinical HF and reducing mortality and adverse cardiovascular events, including:\n- For patients with LVEF \u226440%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent clinical HF and for mortality reduction."

The report noted that the trend correlates with a shift from coronary heart disease as the underlying cause of HF deaths to metabolic diseases and other noncardiac causes of HF, including obesity, diabetes, malignancies, chronic pulmonary diseases, and renal disease. The mortality rate following hospitalization for HF is estimated at around 10% at 30 days, 22% at 1 year, and 42% at 5 years. This can increase to >50% for patients with stage D HF. **Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score**\nThe Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score is a useful tool for determining prognosis in patients presenting to the emergency department with HF. This score is used to determine the 14-day mortality risk, hospital readmission, and acute coronary syndrome to help arrive at safe disposition planning. Patients with a score of 0 are considered low risk. A score of 1 to 2 is considered moderate risk, a score of 3 to 4 is considered high risk, and a score of 5 or higher is considered very high risk."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nHF is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating an interprofessional approach to optimize patient-centered care and outcomes. Physicians, including clinical cardiologists, interventionalists, electrophysiologists, HF specialists, and cardiac imaging specialists, collaborate to diagnose, manage, and treat HF using evidence-based medical and procedural interventions. Advanced practitioners, such as HF nurse practitioners, play a crucial role in ongoing patient assessment, medication titration, and patient education to improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy. Specialty-trained HF nurses are vital in educating patients on lifestyle modifications, symptom recognition, and weight management to prevent exacerbations and reduce hospital admissions. Physical therapists help improve functional capacity and promote safe activity levels, while HF-trained social workers and case managers assess patients in community settings or through home visits to facilitate adherence to care plans and address social determinants of health that may impact disease management.\nEffective interprofessional communication and care coordination are essential to enhancing patient safety, team performance, and long-term outcomes in HF management. Structured communication strategies, such as interdisciplinary rounds and shared electronic health records, ensure seamless information exchange among clinicians. Clinical pharmacists work closely with physicians and nurses to review patient medication lists, optimize pharmacologic therapy, and prevent adverse drug-drug interactions, thereby improving medication safety. Collaboration between primary care clinicians and cardiologists helps ensure continuity of care, minimize adverse effects of medical therapy, and slow disease progression. A well-coordinated, team-based approach significantly improves the quality of life for HF patients by integrating medical, pharmacologic, and lifestyle interventions while reducing hospitalizations and mortality."

Introduction\nHeart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from complex pathophysiological processes that impair ventricular structure or function. These impairments prohibit the ventricle from either filling with or ejecting blood. The signs and symptoms of heart failure, particularly dyspnea, fatigue, and congestion, are demonstrative of the most current definition of heart failure\u2014\"an inability of the heart to pump blood to the body commensurate with its needs, or to so do only at the cost of increased filling pressures.\" Heart failure is a significant public health issue; the incidence and prevalence of heart failure are increasing in the United States and across the globe. Additionally, heart failure is the end stage of many disease processes, and the risk of developing heart failure increases with increasing age. Heart failure is frequently a progressive disease process, and progression is associated with decreased survival, regardless of underlying etiology. To underline these risks and the progression of disease, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have described and defined the following stages of heart failure:\n- **Stage A: At Risk for Heart Failure** - patients at risk for heart failure without symptoms, structural heart disease, or cardiac biomarkers of (ventricular) stretch or injury. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to modify underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure. - **Stage B: Pre-Heart Failure** - patients with evidence of increased filling pressures by invasive or noninvasive methods or patients with risk factors and increased biomarkers of stretch or cardiac injury that are not explained by other disease processes. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to treat risk and structural heart disease to prevent heart failure."

Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality. - **Stage D: Advanced Heart Failure** - patients with marked symptoms of heart failure that interfere with daily life and with recurrent hospitalizations despite attempts to optimize guideline-directed medical therapy. Therapeutic interventions at this stage aim to reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality. Separate from the ACC/AHA Stage of Heart Failure is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure. This classification is a subjective assessment by a clinician to characterize the functional capacity and symptoms of patients with ACC/AHA stage C or D heart failure. The NYHA Classification is an independent predictor of mortality and is employed clinically to determine the suitability of therapeutic interventions for patients with stage C or D heart failure. The 4 NYHA heart failure classes are as follows:\n- **Class I** : asymptomatic\n- **Class II** : symptomatic with moderate activity\n- **Class III** : symptomatic with mild activity\n- **Class IV** : symptomatic at rest. Heart failure is further classified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The prognosis and response to treatment of patients with heart failure differs significantly when patients are stratified based on LVEF. In 2022, the ACC, AHA, and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) released guidelines for the management of heart failure that incorporate the following classification of heart failure by LVEF:\n- **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)** : patients with an LVEF \u226440%\n- **Heart Failure with Improved Ejection Fraction (HFimpEF)** : patients with a previous LVEF \u226440% and a subsequent measurement of LVEF >40%\n- **Heart Failure with Mildly Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF)** : patients with an LVEF 41% to 49% with evidence of spontaneous or provokable increased left ventricular filling pressures (LVFPs), characterized by elevated natriuretic peptides or hemodynamic measurements."

    "text": "Etiology\nHeart failure is the common endpoint for many disease processes. Worldwide, the most common underlying etiology of heart failure is ischemic heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, which confers a relative risk of heart failure of 8.1. Independent risk factors for the development of heart failure as identified during the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study include male sex, cigarette smoking, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and valvular disease. Social determinants of health, such as education, occupation, and income, also contribute to the development of heart failure. **Predisposing Conditions for Primary Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction**\nThe risk factors, underlying etiologies, and pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF differ significantly; HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for all heart failure subtypes; aging significantly influences the development of HFpEF more than HFrEF. However, individuals younger than 65 can develop HFpEF; this may represent a unique age-based phenotype. This same increased influence is seen for atrial fibrillation, female sex, and pulmonary hypertension of any etiology. Obesity and diabetes are also significant risk factors and predictors of HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF and obesity tend to be younger than patients with HFpEF and an average body mass index. While arterial hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of HFpEF across all populations, obesity is a disproportionately substantial risk factor for patients who identify as African American or Hispanic. HFpEF is rarely due to a single identifiable clinical condition but arises in patients with various risk factors; the predominant risk factor may or may not indicate a specific phenotype of HFpEF\u2014thus, the heterogeneity of the disease."

These conditions are sometimes referred to as \"HFpEF mimics.\" These mimics include but are not limited to restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies of any etiology, constrictive pericarditis, and valvular heart disease. In the United States, left-sided valvular disease is the most commonly encountered HFpEF mimic, and aortic stenosis should be suspected in all patients with signs, symptoms, or suspicion of HFpEF. **Etiologies of Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction**\nPatients with HFpEF are at increased risk for deterioration of cardiac function in the setting of various commonly encountered clinical conditions. The development of a clinical condition requiring increased cardiac output that the failing heart cannot meet increases the risk of acute pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Examples of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions that may induce the acute decompensation of patients with HFpEF include but are not limited to:\n- Acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease\n- Anemia\n- Chronic pulmonary disease, or the exacerbation thereof\n- Dysrhythmia, particularly tachyarrhythmia, especially new-onset atrial fibrillation\n- Infection\n- Ischemia\n- Increased salt intake or water retention\n- Medication noncompliance, including antihypertensive or diuretics\n- Poorly controlled or uncontrolled hypertension."

Worldwide estimates for individuals living with heart failure exceed 60 million people, equating to a prevalence of 1% to 3% of the global population. Heart failure is the most common reason for hospitalization for patients 65 and older in the United States, and rates of hospitalizations increased from 2014 to 2017. Approximately 6.7 million Americans older than 25 are estimated to have some form of heart failure; this number is expected to increase to 8.5 million Americans by 2030. The incidence and prevalence of heart failure increase with age. The lifetime risk of heart failure has increased from approximately 20% to 24%, possibly due to an increase in life expectancy and the incidence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Data gathered from the second 25-year epoch of the Framingham Heart Study (1990-2014) has demonstrated that the lifetime risk of HFpEF approximates 19.3%, exceeding the approximate 11.4% lifetime risk of HFrEF. This appears to be particularly true for women, whose apparent lifetime risk of HFpEF is 10.7% compared to 5.8% for HFrEF; these risks vary with ethnicity. The incidence and prevalence of HFpEF varies among populations and is increasing overall; this increase may partially be due to improved diagnostic capabilities and more uniform diagnostic parameters. Tsao et al. reported an increase of 53% in HFpEF diagnoses among participants in the Framingham Heart Study and Cardiovascular Health Study between 2000 and 2009. Chang et al. reported an 8.2% increase in HFpEF diagnoses among Black women compared to a 5.9% increase for White women; all patients participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study between 2005 and 2014. The same study demonstrated a rise in HFpEF diagnoses for Black men (5.7%) and White men (6.3%)."

Contrarily, data derived from Olmstead County in Minnesota demonstrated a decrease of 28% in the incidence of HFpEF diagnoses between 2000 and 2010. While it is clear that the overall prevalence of heart failure is increasing globally, the incidence and prevalence of heart failure demonstrate significant geographic differences. However, data are lacking from some geographic areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and differences in diagnostic criteria and reporting practices across the globe limit the accuracy of comparative data. Despite these limitations, when available data are derived from studies that define HFpEF as an ejection fraction of \u226550%, stark geographic differences in prevalence emerge. Shiga et al. reported an HFpEF prevalence of 43% in 1245 patients with heart failure hospitalized in Japan between 2013 and 2014. Wang et al. evaluated 5236 patients in a community-based heart failure management program in Australia and reported a 37.4% prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses. In contrast, the prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses in the European Society of Cardiology long-term registry and Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Registry was only 16%."

    "text": "Wang et al. evaluated 5236 patients in a community-based heart failure management program in Australia and reported a 37.4% prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses. In contrast, the prevalence of HFpEF diagnoses in the European Society of Cardiology long-term registry and Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Registry was only 16%. Pathophysiology\nThe clinical manifestations of HFpEF are ultimately due to complex pathophysiological processes in cardiomyocyte structure and function, resulting in hemodynamic derangements. However, the pathophysiology of HFpEF is likely not limited to the cardiomyocyte (see **Image. ** Pathophysiology of Heart Failure). Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of HFpEF. Obesity is a chronic systemic inflammatory state that induces hemodynamic derangements and hormonal abnormalities that stress the cardiovascular system. Overweight and obese individuals demonstrate subclinical changes in the structure and function of the left ventricle, even in the presence of a normal ejection fraction. Increased adiposity is associated with worsening left ventricular diastolic function regardless of left ventricular mass. Central obesity is associated with age-related increases in ventricular end-systolic elastance in women but not in men; obesity and female sex are significant risk factors for the development of HFpEF. Additionally, right ventricular function is impaired in patients with HFpEF; right ventricular dysfunction is more marked in obese patients with HFpEF than in those with a normal body mass index. Integral to the pathophysiology of HFpEF is the concept of diminished physiologic reserve. Abnormalities in skeletal muscle and vascular endothelium significantly contribute to decreased reserve. Exercise tolerance and capacity are decreased in patients with HFpEF, as demonstrated by more severe dyspnea and fatigue at matched workloads than controls. This appears particularly true in older patients with HFpEF. Additionally, patients with HFpEF demonstrate impaired peripheral oxygen extraction during exercise; the exact etiology of this impairment remains undefined but may represent intrinsic deficiencies in the function of skeletal muscle, vascular endothelium, or mitochondria."

Additionally, patients with HFpEF demonstrate impaired peripheral oxygen extraction during exercise; the exact etiology of this impairment remains undefined but may represent intrinsic deficiencies in the function of skeletal muscle, vascular endothelium, or mitochondria. Patients with HFpEF demonstrate a reduction in total arterial compliance during submaximal and peak exercise. While oxygen transport and utilization are impaired in all patients with HFpEF regardless of the degree of exercise intolerance, exact impairments vary among patients, and underlying comorbidities strongly influence impairment. While the cellular mechanisms contributing to HFpEF remain ill-defined, the result of cellular and tissue pathophysiologic processes is structural remodeling of the left ventricle, a subsequent decrease in left ventricular reserve, abnormal hemodynamics, and the secondary organ dysfunction that causes the clinical syndrome of HFpEF. Historically, HFpEF was thought to present in patients with concentric ventricular remodeling; recent studies have demonstrated that HFpEF may be observed in patients with any form of cardiac remodeling, and many patients with HFpEF have normal ventricular structure. Despite the heterogeneity of left ventricular structure, the most prominent hemodynamic finding in patients with HFpEF is elevated LVFPs. Patients in the early stages of HFpEF have normal LVFPs at rest, and elevations only occur with exercise. As the disease progresses, elevations in LVFPs are observed at rest. These elevations in LVFPs are the result of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction secondary to incomplete myocardial relaxation, increased ventricular stiffness with subsequent decreased ventricular distensibility, and a shift in the Frank-Starling mechanism initially during exercise and eventually at rest. Elevations in LVFPs, even when inconsistent, induce structural remodeling of the left atrium. Significant differences in left atrial structure and function exist between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF; left atrial function is more closely correlated with outcomes in HFpEF. Compared to patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF have smaller left atrial volumes. However, patients with HFpEF have increased left atrial peak pressures, stiffness, and wall stress and are more likely to have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation further exacerbates the remodeling and dysfunction of the left atrium, which increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension."

Atrial fibrillation further exacerbates the remodeling and dysfunction of the left atrium, which increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension. History and Physical\nPatients with HFpEF typically exhibit intolerance to physical activity characterized by exertional dyspnea (98%) and fatigue (59%). With the progression of HFpEF, these symptoms will occur with lower activity levels and may be accompanied by evidence of congestion. Some patients with HFpEF are clinically asymptomatic, or their symptoms are so mild they go unnoticed. The remaining clinical manifestations of HFpEF are typically the same as seen in other heart failure subtypes, including HFrEF. Obtaining a thorough medical history and performing a comprehensive physical examination facilitate the classification of heart failure, which helps guide therapeutic interventions. The signs and symptoms of heart failure overlap with many other disease processes. Worsening ventricular dysfunction results in more severe symptoms and apparent signs. However, there is no single sign or symptom pathognomonic for heart failure. **Medical History**\nA comprehensive medical history should include a thorough medication history, including patient medication compliance. Inquiries into cardiovascular risk factors, known cardiovascular diagnoses, and prior cardiovascular interventions are mandatory. Any family history of heart failure in the 3 previous generations should be noted; many cardiomyopathies have a genetic component. Quantification of current and prior tobacco and alcohol use, as well as any history of exposure to drugs of abuse, must be pursued. An assessment of social determinants of health is recommended. Symptoms that patients with heart failure commonly describe include dyspnea, initially with exertion and then at rest. Patients may describe orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Dulled mental status or \"brain fog\" is not uncommon. Daytime oliguria with resulting nocturia is regularly seen as extravasation of vascular fluid worsens."

Dulled mental status or \"brain fog\" is not uncommon. Daytime oliguria with resulting nocturia is regularly seen as extravasation of vascular fluid worsens. Peripheral edema of the distal lower extremities may initially resolve with elevation; patients commonly report going to bed with swollen feet that normalize by morning. Eventually, this edema may become pitting. Right upper quadrant pain is sometimes reported and is evidence of liver capsular distention. Anorexia and nausea may be evidence of decreased perfusion of the bowel and bowel edema. Exertional chest pain is also a common presenting symptom. **Physical Examination**\nPhysical examination findings vary with the severity of the heart failure. Patients with isolated HFpEF who are not acutely decompensated are most likely to demonstrate mild systolic hypertension, and approximately 10% to 20% have some degree of jugular venous distention. Evidence of diaphoresis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia are indicative of severe heart failure or acute decompensation. Contrarily, patients with severe decompensation may be hypotensive due to decreased peripheral tissue perfusion. Cardiopulmonary auscultation may reveal rales or an S3 or loud P2 heart sound. Pitting edema of the lower extremities may be observed; presacral pitting edema may be noted in nonambulatory patients. Hepatomegaly may be observed, which may be tender in acute decompensation. A hepatojugular reflex and ascites demonstrable by a fluid wave or changes in abdominal percussion are evidence of significant peripheral congestion."

Evaluation\nExertional dyspnea is a common clinical complaint. The clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure are reported and observed in many disease processes. Additionally, the overt manifestations of HFpEF are common to all subtypes of heart failure, making diagnosing HFpEF challenging. It is reasonable to suspect HFpEF as a possible diagnosis in any patient with exertional dyspnea and one of the following clinical parameters not otherwise explained by an alternative diagnosis:\n- Age 60 or older\n- Atrial fibrillation\n- Chronic kidney disease\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Diabetes\n- Hypertension\n- Overweight/obesity\nDiagnostic algorithms such as the HFA-PEFF (Heart Failure Association. **P** retest Assessment, **E** chocardiography and natriuretic peptide, **F** unctional testing, **F** inal etiology) and H2FPEF (**H** eavy, **2** or more hypertensive drugs, atrial **F** ibrillation, **P** ulmonary hypertension, **E** lder older than 60, elevated **F** illing pressures) have been developed and evaluated to identify HFpEF noninvasively.

An evidence-based diagnostic approach to patients with suspected HFpEF is outlined in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. For patients presenting with a sign or symptom of HFpEF, additional testing is recommended to establish the diagnosis and, if possible, the specific etiology; the presence of underlying comorbidities should also be determined and documented (see **Image. ** Flowsheet). **Initial Evaluation: Laboratory Testing**\n**Complete blood count:** Anemia is an established risk factor for heart failure and negatively affects clinical outcomes; the negative impact is inversely proportional to the hemoglobin level."

It has been proposed that several MASLD-associated HFpEF phenotypes are commonly encountered in clinical practice. **Iron studies, including serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation:** Intravenous iron therapy in symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with heart failure has been shown to improve functional status and quality of life and reduce hospitalizations for worsening heart failure. **Thyroid-stimulating hormone:** Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states are underlying risk factors for the development of heart failure, and low triiodothyronine syndrome is commonly encountered in patients with HFpEF. **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP):** Measurement of either natriuretic peptide is helpful to exclude or support a diagnosis of heart failure. No scientific evidence exists to advocate using one test over another; using their respective values and endpoints interchangeably is inappropriate. However, measuring natriuretic peptides in the outpatient setting in patients with dyspnea and an equivocal physical examination provides minimal diagnostic value. Many cardiac and noncardiac conditions can cause elevation in natriuretic peptide levels, including advancing age, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease."

The need to categorize heart failure is considered an indication to perform TTE. Determination of LVEF is the critical step in classifying heart failure and guides evidence-based therapeutic interventions. If TTE is inadequate, other cardiac imaging studies such as cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac computed tomography, or radionuclide imaging can be considered. However, TTE provides a wealth of information in a noninvasive manner, including the size, function, motion, and geometry of all cardiac chambers and valves, estimates of LVFPs, and estimates of atrial, systolic pulmonary artery, and central venous pressures."

Treatment / Management\n**Therapeutic Interventions in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction**\nThe goals of therapy for HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, prevent disease progression, reduce hospitalizations, and effectively manage underlying comorbidities. To this end, lifestyle and behavioral modifications are a cornerstone of therapeutic intervention. **Lifestyle interventions**\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF. Exercise training, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, and weight loss improve functional status, exercise performance, rates of heart failure-specific hospitalization, and quality of life in patients with HFpEF. Caloric restriction and exercise training may have positive additive effects in patients with HFpEF, especially if they are older with concomitant obesity. In addition to caloric restriction, at least 1 study has demonstrated that sodium restriction as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improves ventricular diastolic function and arterial elastance in patients with HFpEF and hypertension. **Antihypertensive therapies**\nDiuretics, angiotensin receptor\u2013neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) are the preferred pharmacologic interventions if blood pressure is uncontrolled in a patient with HFpEF. The currently recommended blood pressure goal is below 130/80 mm Hg. The nonrandomized Optimize-HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) registry demonstrated improved 30-day mortality and decreased hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared to no diuretic therapy after hospital discharge for heart failure. Bumetanide and torsemide have better bioavailability than furosemide. Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics."

Diuretic resistance is a common problem and may be due to excessive dietary sodium consumption, using medications that negatively affect diuretic action, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or underlying chronic kidney disease. A meta-analysis of 11 trials of 14,262 patients in sinus rhythm, including 244 patients with HFpEF, demonstrated that beta blockers reduce mortality and have beneficial effects. Patients with HFpEF and concomitant coronary artery disease also benefit from beta-blocker administration. The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial of 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and an LVEF of greater than 45% that demonstrated some reduction in hospitalization rates for heart failure. This was particularly true for patients with an LVEF of less than 55% to 60% and those with elevated BNP. A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan, as compared with valsartan, has a tendency to lower the risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations overall, but more so in women with HFpEF than men; the average LVEF in study participants was 57%. **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy**\nThe effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy on cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF has been demonstrated in the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) and Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-PRESERVED) trials. The DELIVER trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin decreased the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with HFpEF. The EMPEROR-PRESERVED trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalizations, decline in kidney function, and improved quality of life in patients with HFpEF. The effects of SGLTi therapy are consistent for patients with HFpEF across all age groups, and increasing age has not been associated with an increase in adverse events."

SGLT2i therapy should be considered in all patients with HFpEF, with or without underlying type 2 diabetes, as early as index hospitalization after initial medical stabilization. In patients with HFpEF, obesity, and underlying type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonists are beneficial if dual therapy is required. **Rate control in atrial fibrillation**\nBeta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred therapies for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFpEF. Digoxin may be considered in hypotensive patients. Atrial fibrillation in patients with HFpEF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, or a mechanical mitral valve requires anticoagulation regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score. The 2023 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation recommends catheter ablation as a first-line therapy to improve symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in younger patients with fewer comorbidities. **Additional therapies**\nIn patients with HFpEF and suspected sleep apnea, consultation with sleep medicine for possible polysomnography is recommended. Fatigue is a common symptom of heart failure, and daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of sleep apnea; obesity is a risk factor for both disease processes. Using CardioMEMS, a pulmonary artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring system, improves quality of life and decreases hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF and frequent hospitalizations. Additionally, CardioMEMS utilization has been shown to improve underlying metabolic comorbidities in tandem with improving pulmonary artery pressures. Coronary angiogram and revascularization should be considered if ischemia is driving symptoms of HFpEF. The 2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of heart failure receive palliative and supportive care. In the context of patients with HFpEF, palliative care is defined as \"patient- and family-centered care that optimizes health-related quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering.\" Primary palliative care should begin early in the course of illness, and the interdisciplinary team can address many primary needs."

Components of primary palliative care include high-quality communication, anticipatory guidance, advance care planning, home and case management assistance, care coordination, and addressing barriers to care such as food insecurity and transportation needs. **Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction**\nMultidisciplinary shock team assessment and intervention can improve 30-day all-cause mortality and reduce in-hospital mortality in patients with clinical and hemodynamics-proven cardiogenic shock of any etiology. Intravenous vasopressor support can temporarily improve hemodynamics in patients with cardiogenic shock and improve end-organ perfusion; norepinephrine is preferred except in patients with tachyarrhythmias who benefit from phenylephrine. Vasopressor support allows time for diuresis and correction of precipitating factors like arrhythmia and ischemia. Appropriate ventilatory support and diuresis are the cornerstones of therapy for patients with acutely decompensated HFpEF. In most cases, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazide diuretics; there is no scientific evidence to support one loop diuretic over another in acutely decompensated patients with HFpEF. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial revealed no clinically significant differences in symptomatic improvement between bolus or continuous intravenous loop diuretics. Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide, thiazide-like, or acetazolamide. Adding metolazone increases the risk of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality compared to loop diuretics alone. Contrarily, the Acetazolamide in Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume OveRload (ADVOR) trial demonstrated that adding acetazolamide to loop diuretics increases the incidence of successful decongestion in patients with acute heart failure within three days compared to placebo. Following the initial stabilization of hemodynamics and ventilation, assessing and managing ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitating factors and comorbidities is paramount. Urgent revascularization is preferred in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. Intravenous or topical nitroglycerin is preferred in patients with hypertensive urgency or emergency and pulmonary edema; nitroglycerin decreases preload in patients with pulmonary edema."

A discussion of the signs and symptoms that may indicate the acute decompensation of heart failure and when to contact a healthcare practitioner. Taking Medicine to Control Heart Failure. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nThe management of HFpEF requires a collaborative effort among healthcare professionals, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists, and others, to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, ensure patient safety, and optimize team performance. Given that heart failure represents a common endpoint for various disease processes, including ischemic heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, addressing the underlying etiologies and risk factors is crucial. HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with predisposing conditions that involve increasing age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Additionally, HFpEF may result from multiple risk factors, including sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, iron deficiency, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dysrhythmias. The complexity of HFpEF necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, and the exact pathogenic role of each risk factor remains incompletely understood. Diagnosing HFpEF is challenging due to common clinical manifestations and the overlap with other heart failure subtypes. Diagnostic algorithms, such as HFA-PEFF and H2FPEF, along with additional testing like echocardiography and natriuretic peptide measurement, are employed to confirm the diagnosis. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure provides an evidence-based diagnostic approach. Therapeutic interventions for HFpEF focus on reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, preventing disease progression, and managing comorbidities. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise training, weight loss, and sodium restriction, are cornerstones of treatment. Antihypertensive therapies, including diuretics, ARNIs, ARBs, and MRAs, are recommended, with a blood pressure goal lower than 130/80 mm Hg. Beta-blockers, sacubitril-valsartan, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are shown to have beneficial effects."
