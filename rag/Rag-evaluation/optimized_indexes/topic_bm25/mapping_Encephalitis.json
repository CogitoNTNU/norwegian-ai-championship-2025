    "text": "Evaluation\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis is the primary diagnostic tool for PAM, whereas tissue diagnosis is essential for GAE. Unfortunately, amebic meningoencephalitis is very rarely diagnosed before autopsy. Laboratory findings suggestive of PAM include leukocytosis with a left shift. The CSF opening pressure is very high. The CSF white cell count ranges from 300 to 26,000 cells/mm with polymorphonuclear predominance. CSF red blood cells are usually seen, and hemorrhagic fluid is seen as the disease progresses. Hypoglycorrhachia and elevated protein are characteristic. A definitive diagnosis is made by observation of motile trophozoites on centrifuged CSF wet mount preparation. Giemsa or trichrome stains help in identifying morphologic features of the trophozoites _._ The diagnosis can also be made by using laboratory testing for _Naegleria fowleri_ nucleic acid in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens or _Naegleria fowleri_ antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens.\nTo establish the diagnosis of GAE, brain tissue demonstrating trophozoites and cysts is needed. Moderate granulomatous inflammation with prominent vascular involvement is typically present on brain biopsy. CSF parameters show mild pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low or normal glucose concentration. Rarely,_Acanthamoeba_ trophozoites may be seen on the Giemsa stain of the CSF sediment. Head computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should precede lumbar puncture if clinical signs of focal central nervous system involvement or elevated intracranial pressure are present. MRI of the brain shows the presence of single or multiple space-occupying lesions with ring enhancement. Computed tomography may show progressive hydrocephalus, meningeal thickening, pseudotumoral lesions, largely isolated lesions, or multifocal ring-enhancing lesions. On post-mortem examination, significant edema and hemorrhage of the brain are seen."

Computed tomography may show progressive hydrocephalus, meningeal thickening, pseudotumoral lesions, largely isolated lesions, or multifocal ring-enhancing lesions. On post-mortem examination, significant edema and hemorrhage of the brain are seen. Treatment / Management\nDue to the rarity of the disease and lack of clinical trials, the definitive treatment for GAE is not clear at this time. A combination of drugs is used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend combination treatment with pentamidine, sulfadiazine, flucytosine, and either fluconazole or itraconazole. Multiple other regimens are also recommended. Chronic Acanthamoeba meningitis was successfully treated in 2 children with a combination of oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and ketoconazole. Resection of brain lesions may help as well. Similarly, the optimal treatment of PAM is unknown; reports range from 9 to 30 days. For the treatment of PAM amphotericin B, both intravenously and intrathecally is recommended, but considering the fulminant course of the disease and high mortality rates, a combination of drugs is generally used. Reports include the use of amphotericin in addition to rifampin, fluconazole, miltefosine, and azithromycin. Posaconazole has also been shown to be effective in mouse models of disease. It may replace fluconazole as the azole of choice, although further studies are warranted to confirm this choice. Only one case of GAE due to _Sappinia_ has been reported in humans (attributed to _S diploidea_). The patient was a previously healthy male farmer who engaged in handling livestock. The disease manifested as headache, vomiting, blurry vision, and loss of consciousness following a sinus infection. Histopathology of a single 2 cm focal lesion in the posterior left temporal lobe demonstrated trophozoites (40 to 60 microns in diameter) with two nuclei. The infection was likely acquired by inhalation."

Pearls and Other Issues\nOther important information to note includes the following:\n- Patients with PAM typically have a history of swimming, diving, bathing, or playing in warm, generally stagnant freshwater during the previous 1 to 9 days.\n- GAE presents as a subacute to chronic disease process with weeks to months of progressive headache, low-grade fevers, visual disturbances, behavioral abnormalities, and focal neurologic deficits.\n- Two patterns of clinical presentation have been described with _Balamuthia mandrillaris._ While some patients present with an initial skin lesion followed by neurologic manifestations in weeks or months, others present with CNS involvement. The skin lesion consists of an asymptomatic nonulcerated plaque, most commonly on the central face or the knee area. Wide resection of the skin may prove to be therapeutic.\n- A definitive diagnosis of PAM is made by observation of motile trophozoites on centrifuged CSF wet mount preparation.\n- Approximately 11 survivors of PAM have been reported in the literature."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nAmebic encephalitis is an exceptionally rare and highly lethal central nervous system infection caused by free-living amoebae found in freshwater, lakes, and rivers. There are two types of amebic encephalitis: primary amebic meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis. The initial symptoms of PAM are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, while the symptoms of GAM can mimic a brain abscess or meningitis. These infections are almost always fatal. The high mortality rate is due to a lack of optimal treatment, the rarity of the disease, and delays in diagnosis. Clinicians working in communities with potential exposure to large stagnant bodies of freshwater should play a role in educating patients about the risk and providing information about how to mitigate the risk. If the disease is being considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient, early laboratory evaluation and emergent consultations with infectious disease specialists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons are recommended to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. Patients with amebic meningoencephalitis may require monitoring in the intensive care unit. A hypothermia protocol may be considered as this has been shown to increase survival. An interprofessional healthcare team, including intensivists, infectious disease specialists, nurses, social workers, and pharmacists (specialized in infectious disease), may help facilitate family support and provide updates regarding the condition and prognosis of the patient. Intensive care nurses monitor patients and notify the team of status changes. The few reported survivors have been left with severe neurological disabilities and sequelae of encephalitis. Infectious disease pharmacists review treatment protocols, assess microbial susceptibility to the regimen chosen, and check for drug-drug interactions, reporting their findings to the prescribing/ordering clinician."
