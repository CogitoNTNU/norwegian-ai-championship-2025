PE typically originates as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. Together, PE and DVT form the spectrum of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Symptoms of PE vary and are often nonspecific, including dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and syncope. Severe cases may involve hemodynamic instability and signs of right ventricular strain. Diagnosis combines clinical probability scoring systems like the Wells and Geneva criteria with tests such as D-dimer levels, CT pulmonary angiography, and ultrasound. Hemodynamically unstable patients may require bedside imaging for rapid diagnosis.\nManagement of PE includes supportive measures, anticoagulation as the mainstay of treatment, and reperfusion strategies for severe cases. Thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, and surgical embolectomy are options for hemodynamically unstable patients. Long-term anticoagulation is essential to prevent recurrence, with duration tailored to individual risk factors. Recognizing and promptly treating PE is critical to reducing its high mortality and morbidity rates.

Introduction\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot that has arisen from a different area obstructs the pulmonary arteries. Most commonly, PE originates from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. PE usually occurs when a part of this thrombus breaks off and enters the pulmonary circulation. PE rarely occurs from embolizing other materials into the pulmonary circulation, eg, air, fat, or tumor cells. Together, PE and DVT comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factors for PE include genetic predispositions like thrombophilia and acquired conditions, including prolonged immobility, surgery, and malignancy.\nDespite advancements in diagnostic tools and treatment options, the nonspecific symptoms of PE (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope) often overlap with other cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, making timely diagnosis challenging for clinicians. Prompt recognition and management of PE are critical, as delayed intervention can lead to severe complications, including hemodynamic instability, right ventricular failure, and sudden death. Risk stratification tools such as the Wells criteria and Geneva score, alongside diagnostic imaging, are essential for accurate diagnosis. However, the underutilization of these tools, coupled with variations in therapeutic approaches, underscores the need for standardized clinical protocols. Clinicians can improve patient outcomes through enhanced knowledge and proficiency in identifying risk factors, employing diagnostic strategies, and initiating evidence-based treatments."

Clinicians can improve patient outcomes through enhanced knowledge and proficiency in identifying risk factors, employing diagnostic strategies, and initiating evidence-based treatments. Etiology\n**Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism**\nMost PEs originate as lower extremity DVTs. Hence, PE risk factors are the same as DVT. The Virchow triad of hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and endothelial injury provides an understanding of these risk factors. Risk factors can be classified as genetic and acquired. Genetic risk factors include thrombophilia, eg, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Acquired risk factors include immobilization for prolonged periods (eg, bed rest of longer than 3 days, any type of travel for >4 hours), recent orthopedic surgery, malignancy, indwelling venous catheter, obesity, pregnancy, cigarette smoking, and oral contraceptive pill use. Smoking is a risk factor for all causes of pulmonary infarction, including those associated with PE. Paradoxically, younger age (peaking at 40) and increased height are associated with an increased likelihood of developing a PE complicated by pulmonary infarction, while obesity is associated with a reduced likelihood. Other predisposing factors for VTE include:\n- Fracture of lower limb\n- Hospitalization for heart failure or atrial fibrillation/flutter within the previous 3 months\n- Hip or knee replacement\n- Major trauma\n- History of previous venous thromboembolism\n- Central venous lines\n- Chemotherapy\n- Congestive heart failure or respiratory failure\n- Hormone replacement therapy\n- Oral contraceptive therapy\n- Postpartum period\n- Infection (specifically pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and HIV)\n- Cancer (highest risk in metastatic disease)\n- Thrombophilia\n- Bed rest longer than 3 days\n- Obesity\n- Pregnancy\nCancer carries a high risk for thrombus formation and, hence, PE. Pancreatic cancer, hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk for VTE."

    "text": "Pancreatic cancer, hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk for VTE. Pathophysiology\nPE occurs when a blot clot enters the pulmonary circulation. Multiple emboli are typically involved within the lower lung lobes more frequently than the upper lobes; bilateral lung involvement is also more common. Large emboli tend to obstruct the main pulmonary artery, causing saddle embolus with deleterious cardiovascular consequences. In contrast, smaller-sized emboli block the peripheral arteries and can lead to pulmonary infarction, manifested by intra-alveolar hemorrhage. PE leads to impaired gas exchange due to obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed, leading to a mismatch in the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio because alveolar ventilation remains the same. Still, pulmonary capillary blood flow decreases, leading to dead space ventilation and hypoxemia. Also, mediators, eg, serotonin, are released, which cause vasospasm and further decrease pulmonary flow in unaffected lung areas. Local accumulation of inflammatory mediators alters lung surfactant and stimulates respiratory drive, resulting in hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis. In PE, pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to the mechanical obstruction of the vascular bed with thrombus and hypoxic vasoconstriction. Pulmonary artery pressure increases if thromboembolic occlusion is >30% to 50% of the total cross-sectional area of the pulmonary arterial bed. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance increases the right ventricular afterload, which impedes right ventricular outflow and causes right ventricular dilation and flattening or bowing of the interventricular septum. Developing the right bundle branch block may increase the desynchronization of the ventricles. The decreased right ventricular outflow and concomitant right ventricular dilation reduce left ventricular filling, compromising cardiac output. As a result, left ventricular filling is reduced in early diastole, reducing cardiac output and causing systemic hypotension and hemodynamic instability. Right ventricle failure due to acute pressure overload is the primary cause of death in severe PE."

Right ventricle failure due to acute pressure overload is the primary cause of death in severe PE. Given the above pathophysiological considerations, clinical symptoms and signs of overt right ventricular failure and hemodynamic instability indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30-day) mortality. Additionally, the early literature suggested that patients with underlying cardiac disease were at the greatest risk for developing a pulmonary infarction associated with acute PE, as poor collateral circulation, in combination with pulmonary thromboembolism, was thought to result in infarction. However, recent studies suggest the opposite. Specifically, younger patients without cardiopulmonary disease were found to be more likely to suffer a pulmonary infarction secondary to PE. Experts hypothesize that longstanding local tissue hypoxia from chronic cardiopulmonary disease states leads to more robust bronchial vascular collateralization, protecting parenchyma from infarction. The lung parenchyma receives its oxygen supply from 3 nonredundant sources: deoxygenated blood from pulmonary arteries, oxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation, and direct oxygen diffusion from alveoli. A sufficient impedance from one of these sources can cause infarction and subsequent tissue necrosis. Inflammatory mediators from ischemic parenchyma can further limit gas exchange following the resultant vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction. When ischemia of lung tissue is not reversed promptly, infarction ensues. A unilateral infarct occurs in 77% to 87% of pulmonary infarctions, with the strongest predilection for the right lower lobe. Multiple studies show a stark predominance of pulmonary infarction in the lower lobes relative to the upper lobes, thought to be due to gravity\u2019s influence on the unique relationship between alveolar, pulmonary, and bronchial arterial pressure."

History and Physical\n**Clinical History**\nA timely diagnosis of PE is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Notably, 30% of untreated patients with PEs die, while only 8% die after timely therapy. Unfortunately, diagnosing PE can be difficult due to the variety of nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms in patients with acute PE. The most common symptoms of PE include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, presyncope, and syncope. Dyspnea may be acute and severe in a central PE, whereas mild and transient dyspnea is observed in small peripheral PE. In patients with preexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnea may be the only symptom. Chest pain is a frequent symptom usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal emboli causing pulmonary infarction. In central PE, chest pain may be from underlying right ventricular ischemia and needs to be differentiated from an acute coronary syndrome or aortic dissection. Less common presentations include arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), syncope, and hemodynamic collapse. Hemodynamic instability is a rare but essential form of clinical presentation, as it indicates central or extensive PE with severely reduced hemodynamic reserve. Syncope may occur and may be associated with a higher prevalence of hemodynamic instability and right ventricular dysfunction. Recognizing that patients with large PE may sometimes be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms is crucial. PE may often be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally during diagnostic workup for another disease. Therefore, in addition to PE symptoms, clinicians should look for VTE risk factors to determine the clinical probability of PE. **Physical Examination Findings**\nOn examination, patients with PE might have tachypnea and tachycardia, which are common but nonspecific findings."

Evaluation\n**Diagnostic Evaluation of Acute Pulmonary Embolus**\nThe diagnosis of an acute PE comprises various laboratory and imaging studies in conjunction with clinical probability scoring systems, such as the Wells and Geneva criteria. **Arterial blood gas analysis**\nUnexplained hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph should raise clinical suspicion for PE. Widened alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen, respiratory alkalosis, and hypocapnia are common findings on arterial blood gas (ABG) as a pathophysiological response to PE. Notably, respiratory or lactic acidosis is uncommon but can be present in patients with massive PE associated with obstructive shock and respiratory arrest. **Brain natriuretic peptide**\nElevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has limited diagnostic importance in patients suspected of having PE. Right ventricular pressure overload because of acute PE is associated with more myocardial stretch, releasing BNP and N-terminal-proBNP. Thus, the levels of natriuretic peptides in blood reflect the severity of right ventricular dysfunction in acute PE. **Troponin**\nSerum troponin I is beneficial prognostically but not diagnostically. As a marker of right ventricular dysfunction, troponin levels are elevated in 30% to 50% of patients with moderate to large PE and are linked to clinical deterioration and death after PE. **D-dimer**\nD-dimer levels are elevated in plasma whenever an acute thrombotic process occurs in the body because the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways are activated simultaneously. D-dimer testing has a high negative predictive value; hence, a normal D-dimer level makes acute PE or DVT unlikely. However, since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not used to confirm PE."

However, since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not used to confirm PE. As many D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their clinical setting. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a diagnostic sensitivity of at least 95%. ELISA can exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with either low or intermediate pretest probability. A negative ELISA D-dimer and low clinical probability can exclude PE in approximately 30% of suspected patients without further testing. The specificity of D-dimer decreases steadily with age to approximately 10% in patients older than 80. Using age-adjusted cut-offs for patients older than 50 may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in older adults. In one study, using the age-adjusted cut-off instead of the standard D-dimer cut-off of 500 ng/mL or more increased the number of patients in whom the possibility of PE could be ruled out from 6.4% to 30%, without additional false-negative findings. The formula is age (years) x 10 ng/mL for patients older than 50. For example, patient age 75 = age-adjusted d-dimer of 750 ng/mL. **Electrocardiography**\nElectrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities in patients with suspected PE are nonspecific. The most common ECG findings in PE are tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment, T-wave changes, S1Q3T3 pattern, right ventricular strain, and new incomplete right bundle branch block, which are uncommon (see **Image**. Electrocardiogram, Pulmonary Embolism). **Chest radiograph**\nIn PE, a chest radiograph (CXR) is usually normal or might show nonspecific abnormalities such as atelectasis or effusion. It helps to rule out alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. CXR image may be the first clue toward diagnosing pulmonary infarction (see **Image. ** Wedge-Shaped Pulmonary Infarction). A \"Hampton hump\" (wedge-shaped consolidation at the lung periphery), Westermark sign (radiographic oligemia or increased lucency), and Fleischer sign (prominent pulmonary artery) are specific findings but lack sensitivity to be diagnostically sufficient. A sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82%, respectively, with Hampton hump, have been quoted in the literature (see **Image."

A sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82%, respectively, with Hampton hump, have been quoted in the literature (see **Image. ** Hampton Hump). Other features, such as atelectasis or focal consolidation, may be present but are neither sensitive nor specific. The Westermark sign is the sharp cut-off of pulmonary vessels with distal hypoperfusion in a segmental distribution within the lung; these findings are rare but specific to acute PE. Westermark sign may be seen in up to 2% of the cases, resulting from a combination of dilation of the pulmonary artery proximal to the thrombus and the collapse of the distal vasculature. **Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA)**\nMultidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the diagnostic modality of choice for patients with suspected PE. CTPA allows appropriate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The PIOPED (Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis) II study showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for CTPA in PE diagnosis. Moreover, CTPA is the most commonly used imaging technique to diagnose pulmonary infarction in combination with appropriate clinical context (see **Image. ** Pulmonary Embolism). CT findings associated with pulmonary infarction include a feeding vessel or \"vessel sign,\" central lucency, and a semicircular shape. The finding of air bronchograms made a pulmonary infarction less likely. If a vessel sign with a central lucency and no air bronchogram is present on CT, the specificity for detecting pulmonary infarction is 99%. PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pretest clinical probability on the predictive value of CTPA. A normal CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE at 96% and 89% in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability, respectively, but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pretest probability was high. Contrarily, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92% to 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pretest likelihood of PE."

Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgment and the CTPA result. The present data suggest that a negative CTPA result is adequate for excluding PE in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability. Whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated remains controversial. CTPA may be relatively contraindicated in moderate to severe iodinated contrast allergy or renal insufficiency (eGFR \\<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The risk of these contraindications must be measured against the clinical significance of performing the CTPA examination and the availability of other imaging modalities, eg, ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan). If clinically feasible, CTPA should be postponed for premedication for a history of allergy or IV hydration for renal insufficiency. CTPA can detect right ventricular enlargement and other indicators of right ventricular dysfunction. Enlarged right ventricular has predictive value, supported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study in 457 patients. In that study, right ventricular enlargement (right ventricular/left ventricular ratio \u22650.9) was a strong and independent predictor of a severe in-hospital outcome in the overall population and hemodynamically stable patients. **Lung scintigraphy**\nThe planar V/Q scan is an established diagnostic test for suspected PE, mainly performed for patients in whom CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive or when additional testing is needed. A normal chest radiograph is usually required before V/Q scanning. Scans performed on patients with abnormal chest radiographs are likely false positives because the images do not appear normal or a low probability of PE in such patients is present. V/Q scanning remains the test of choice for diagnosing PE in pregnancy for those with a normal chest radiograph. Other patients include those with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and those with severe renal failure."

Other patients include those with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and those with severe renal failure. Planar lung scan results are frequently classified into 3 tiers: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and nondiagnostic scan. Multiple studies have suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. An analysis from the PIOPED II study advocated that a high-probability V/Q scan can confirm PE. However, the positive predictive value of a high-probability V/Q scan is not enough to confirm the PE diagnosis in patients with a low clinical probability. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they require further diagnostic testing. **Pulmonary angiography**\nIn pulmonary angiography, contrast is injected via a catheter introduced into the right heart under fluoroscopy, which was the gold standard in the past for diagnosing PE. The diagnosis of acute PE is made on the evidence of a thrombus, either as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch or a filling defect. With the widespread emergence of CTPA, pulmonary angiography is infrequently used and reserved for rare circumstances for patients with a high clinical probability of PE, in whom CTPA or V/Q scanning is nondiagnostic. Pulmonary angiography seems inferior to CTPA; the results are operator-dependent and highly variable. Therefore, catheter-based pulmonary angiography is performed in patients who need therapeutic benefit since it helps with diagnosis and therapeutic interventions aimed at clot lysis. **Magnetic resonance angiography**\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) regarding suspected PE has been assessed for several years. However, large-scale studies show that this promising technique is not recommended as a first-line test for diagnosing PE due to its low sensitivity, low availability in most emergency settings, and the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans. However, clinicians may consider this imaging option to evaluate PE in patients in whom neither CTPA nor V/Q scan can be performed. Potential advantages include no exposure to radiation. MR pulmonary angiography was studied prospectively in 371 adults with suspected PE."

Among the 48% of patients with technically adequate images, MR pulmonary angiography and MR pulmonary venography have shown a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. **Echocardiography**\nTransthoracic echocardiography can rarely definitively diagnose PE when the thrombus is visualized in the proximal pulmonary arteries. The diagnosis of PE on echocardiography is supported by the presence of a clot in the right heart or new right heart strain, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected PE. An echocardiogram may be helpful to establish a possible diagnosis and justify the emergency use of thrombolytic therapy (see **Image. ** Transesophageal Echocardiography, Pulmonary Embolism). Significant considerations are apparent when using echocardiography to establish a diagnosis of PE. Given the right ventricular's peculiar shape, no single echocardiographic parameter gives quick and accurate right ventricular size or function information. That is why echocardiographic criteria for diagnosing PE have varied between different studies. Because of the negative predictive value of 40% to 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. On the other hand, signs of right ventricular overload or dysfunction may also be present without acute PE and may be due to coexisting cardiac or respiratory disease. Right ventricular dilation is seen in \u226525% of patients with PE on echo and is helpful for risk stratification of the disease. More specific echocardiography findings confer a high positive predictive value for PE with preexisting cardiorespiratory illness. This includes the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the right ventricular outflow tract) \\<60 milliseconds with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient less than 60 mm Hg ('60/60' sign) or McConnell sign (with depressed contractility of the right ventricular free wall compared to the right ventricular apex), is suggestive of PE."

Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation \\<90%. Mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but clinicians should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation. Acute right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over-distend the right ventricular, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output. Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC)/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors may be needed for hemodynamic support. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with PEs. **Anticoagulation**\nRemembering that anticoagulation is the mainstay of treating acute PE is vital. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; fondaparinux) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred since they lower the incidence of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. UFH is usually only used in patients with hemodynamic instability in whom primary reperfusion treatment might be required or in patients with renal impairment. Newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) can also be used for anticoagulation in PE. **Anticoagulation and hemodynamic stability**\nThe treatment for patients with suspected PE is stratified according to the type of PE (hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the clinician's suspicion index. Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE."

Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE. Anticoagulation is started before diagnostic imaging is obtained for hemodynamically stable patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE. For hemodynamically stable patients with a low clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 24 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion of PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 4 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, IVC filter placement should be considered when the diagnosis of PE is confirmed. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE who are hemodynamically unstable, emergent CTPA, portable perfusion scanning, or bedside transthoracic echocardiography should be performed whenever possible. Primary reperfusion treatment, usually thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamically unstable acute PE. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapy are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis. Following reperfusion treatment and hemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from parenteral to oral anticoagulation. **Reperfusion Strategies**\n**Thrombolysis**\nThrombolysis has shown an effective reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance in patients with PE compared to UFH alone; a decrease in right ventricular dilation on echocardiography assesses these improvements. Thrombolysis is preferred when therapy can be instituted within 48 hours of symptom onset, but it has still shown benefit in patients whose symptoms began less than 14 days ago. A meta-analysis suggested a significant reduction in mortality and recurrent PE using thrombolytics. Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial identified the benefits of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE. It demonstrated that thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but it also showed an increased risk of severe bleeding with thrombolytics."

It demonstrated that thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but it also showed an increased risk of severe bleeding with thrombolytics. Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular disease (eg, arteriovenous malformation), known malignant intracranial neoplasm, ischemic stroke within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, recent surgery encroaching on the spinal canal or brain, and recent significant closed-head or facial trauma with radiographic evidence of bony fracture or brain injury. **Catheter-directed treatment**\nCatheter-directed treatment involves the insertion of a catheter into the pulmonary arteries, which is then used for ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, suction embolectomy, rotational embolectomy, thrombus aspiration, or combining mechanical fragmentation with pharmacological catheter-directed thrombolysis. Different studies have shown a success rate of up to 87% for catheter-directed therapies. Catheter-assisted embolectomy techniques carry the inherent risk of perforating the pulmonary arteries, leading to massive hemoptysis or cardiac tamponade. These complications are rare but fatal. **Surgical embolectomy**\nSurgical embolectomy is usually indicated in a patient with hemodynamically unstable PE in whom thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) is contraindicated or in patients with failed thrombolysis. For thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy, no difference in mortality is evident, but the thrombolysis group had a higher risk of stroke and repeated intervention. **Vena cava filters**\nVena cava filters block the path of travel of emboli and prevent them from entering the pulmonary circulation. Filters are indicated in patients with venous thromboembolism who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulants and in patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation. Retrievable filters are preferred, such that after the contraindication has resolved, the filter can be removed, and patients should be anticoagulated. This is because the Prevention of Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism by Vena Cava Interruption (PREPIC) study showed that the insertion of a permanent vena cava filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent PE and a substantial increase in the risk of DVT, without a remarkable difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death."

    "text": "**Long-Term Treatment and Prevention of Recurrence**\nThe aim of anticoagulation after the acute management of PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and prevent the recurrence of VTE over the long term. Clinical trials have assessed various durations of anticoagulant therapy with VKAs for VTE. The findings of these studies established a treatment protocol for acute PE. First, all patients with PE should receive 3 months or more of anticoagulant treatment. Second, after the anticoagulant treatment is stopped, the risk of recurrence is expected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3 to 6 months compared with more prolonged treatment periods (eg, 12 to 24 months). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by \u226490%, but the risk of bleeding partially offsets this benefit. Oral anticoagulants are highly efficient in preventing recurrent VTE at the time of treatment, but after the discontinuation of treatment, they do not eliminate the risk of subsequent recurrence. Notably, about 30% of PEs are unprovoked. Unprovoked PE (ie, PE in the absence of an identifiable risk factor) is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of recurrence compared to patients who had a provoked PE. Patients with persistent risk factors (eg, cancer or elevated antiphospholipid antibodies) have a higher rate of recurrence than those with transient risk factors (eg, immobilization, surgery, or trauma). Consequently, the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains uncertain and should be individualized. A minimum of 3 months is usually recommended, but a more extended period is required if the PE was unprovoked or persistent risk factors are evident. This need for longer anticoagulation should be assessed at the end of 3 months by considering the patient's bleeding risk. Those with a high bleeding risk can limit therapy to 3 months. Special considerations are required for patients with active cancer, given their increased risk for a VTE event."

Prognosis\nShock and right ventricular dysfunction confer a poor prognosis and predict mortality in patients diagnosed with PE. Patients with PE and a coexisting DVT are also at an increased risk for death. While earlier reports reported a high rate of mortality following pulmonary infarction, a study from 2018 found the survival to discharge rate of those suffering from a pulmonary infarction to be high at around 97%. Several prognostic models have been designed, but the PE Severity Index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) are the most commonly used. The PESI score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with an established diagnosis of PE.

Inadequate anticoagulation is the most common reason for recurrent venous thromboembolism while on therapy.\n**Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension**\nThe development of persistent or progressive dyspnea, particularly during the first 3 months to 2 years after diagnosis, should prompt the clinician to investigate the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which affects up to 5% of patients. In patients who remain persistently symptomatic months to years after an acute PE, follow-up CT, ventilation-perfusion scans, or echocardiography should be performed. These modalities demonstrate pulmonary hypertension in CTEPH.\nOn the V/Q scan, patients with CTEPH generally have at least 1 segmental or more significant mismatched ventilation-perfusion defect. For those patients with evidence of CTEPH on V/Q lung scanning, right heart catheterization, and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction or a secondary arteriopathy, for all patients with CTEPH, lifelong anticoagulant therapy is recommended.

Introduction\nAn estimated 10 million individuals worldwide experience venous thromboembolism annually, leading to over 500,000 fatalities in Europe and a range of 100,000 to 300,000 deaths in the US. Pulmonary embolisms can manifest with varying degrees of severity, ranging from asymptomatic to sudden death. This broad spectrum highlights the importance of accurately assessing pulmonary embolism severity from the outset. Given this diversity, it is critical to stratify patients based on their pulmonary embolism-related risk to tailor treatment approaches effectively. While anticoagulation therapy generally suffices for patients at low risk of complications, the benefits of active thrombus removal, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), become increasingly evident with the severity of pulmonary embolism.\nCDT has emerged as a nuanced treatment option, particularly for patients with intermediate to high-risk pulmonary embolism. This intervention aims to reduce the thrombus burden in the pulmonary arteries, potentially improving right ventricular function and patient outcomes. However, the application of CDT is not without risks, as the potential for bleeding and other complications must be weighed against the therapeutic benefits. The landscape of interventional therapies for pulmonary embolism is evolving, with new devices and techniques being developed and approved for clinical use. This dynamic field necessitates a clear understanding of the current state of endovascular interventions and the development of evidence to guide their application in various clinical scenarios."

This dynamic field necessitates a clear understanding of the current state of endovascular interventions and the development of evidence to guide their application in various clinical scenarios. Anatomy and Physiology\nPulmonary embolisms usually originate from the deep veins or pelvis of the lower extremities. Dislodgement of a deep vein thrombosis can cause the blood clot to travel up the venous system through the right heart and become lodged in the pulmonary vasculature. Common locations for a pulmonary embolism to lodge include the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary artery, and segmental or subsegmental branches. Once lodged in the pulmonary vasculature, the blockage may result in hemodynamic heart strain and a decrease in blood supply to the downstream pulmonary parenchyma, depending on the size and location of the pulmonary embolism. This obstruction can lead to right ventricular failure due to acute pressure overload, which is a significant cause of mortality in severe pulmonary embolism cases. Obstruction of over 30% to 50% of the pulmonary arterial bed's cross-sectional area leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary embolism-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by thromboxane A2 and serotonin release, increases pulmonary vascular resistance and decreases arterial compliance.\nThe resultant right ventricular dilation alters the myocardium's contractile properties, increasing wall tension and myocyte stretch, prolonging right ventricular contraction time, and triggering compensatory neurohumoral activation for inotropic and chronotropic stimulation. However, the right ventricles' limited capacity to sustain high pulmonary artery pressure can lead to hemodynamic instability. Excessive neurohumoral activation, potentially causing myocarditis, and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can further damage the right ventricular myocardium. Respiratory failure in pulmonary embolism primarily arises from hemodynamic disturbances leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Additionally, there is the potential for right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale, which exacerbates hypoxemia and increases the risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke."

Additionally, there is the potential for right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale, which exacerbates hypoxemia and increases the risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke. Indications\nMeticulous patient selection remains the cornerstone of endovascular strategies in pulmonary embolism management. Three critical considerations guide the decision to proceed with CDT:\n1. Disease severity and acuity:\n1. Massive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis is the primary choice, offering lower all-cause mortality. In cases where systemic thrombolysis fails, endovascular approaches, including CDT, become potential options within a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) approach, considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and surgical embolectomy for life-saving situations.\n1. Submassive pulmonary embolism: Systemic thrombolysis provides a mortality benefit but raises major bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage.. American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association guidelines consider CDT for deterioration or when adverse prognosis indicators are present. The European Society of Cardiology advocates 2-step risk stratification with validated tools like the pulmonary embolism Severity Index followed by imaging and biomarker assessment. If both clinical and objective assessments indicate high risk and impending cardiopulmonary deterioration is likely, CDT may be considered. This reflects the ongoing need for robust randomized trials. Existing data on ultrasound-assisted CDT shows promise; exceeding heparin alone improves right ventricular size within 24 hours without major bleeding or recurrent venous thromboembolism.\n1. Low-risk pulmonary embolism: Endovascular interventions are generally contraindicated due to low morbidity and mortality. The exception might be large saddle emboli without hemodynamic or right ventricular issues. Ongoing trials on optimal dosing and duration are underway.\n1. Major adverse bleeding risk: Balancing potential CDT benefits with individual bleeding risks is crucial. Comorbidities and bleeding history require careful evaluation.\n1. Patient-specific considerations: Shared decision-making, incorporating patient values, preferences, and goals, is paramount. It ensures that treatment aligns with individual circumstances and desires."

Two such mechanisms are the established EKOS Intelligent Drug Delivery System (IDDC) and the recently approved Bashir Endovascular Catheter (BEC-CDT), each equipped with distinctive instruments to combat pulmonary embolism clots. **EKOS-CDT**\n- Central conductor: The EKOS-IDDC serves as the central conduit for intervention. This multi-lumen catheter allows simultaneous delivery of a thrombolytic agent (eg, rt-PA) and saline coolant directly to the target thrombus. - Sonic disruption module: The MicroSonic Device (MSD) nested within the IDDC harbors multiple ultrasound transducers that emit targeted low-frequency sonic waves to facilitate clot fragmentation and enhance drug penetration. - Hemodynamic monitoring: Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters (eg, pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output) and electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the procedure and guiding therapeutic adjustments. **BEC-CDT**\n- Expandable catheter: The 7-F BEC-CDT occupies the central role in this system. Its unique feature is an expandable \"basket\" equipped with 48 orifices, allowing for strategic deployment and maximizing drug-thrombus contact within the clot. - Pulse spray delivery: A dedicated syringe administers controlled \"pulse sprays\" of the thrombolytic agent, creating initial fissures within the clot. Subsequently, a continuous infusion pump ensures sustained thrombolysis. - Fluoroscopic visualization: Real-time fluoroscopy offers visual guidance for catheter placement, ensuring optimal positioning of the expanding basket within the target thrombus. **Shared Instrumental Landscape**\n- Venous access establishment: Both procedures require initial venous access, typically achieved using a micropuncture needle and introducer sheath, contingent upon individual patient anatomy and institutional protocols."

Personnel\nThe new guidelines recommend a PERT approach at healthcare facilities. The PERT is a multidisciplinary team specialized in diagnosing and managing acute pulmonary embolism. It brings together experts from various specialties to collaborate on optimal patient care. PERTs usually focus on submassive and massive pulmonary embolism cases but can also benefit low-risk patients with major contraindications to standard anticoagulation, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Critical considerations for PERT activation include the following:\n- The initiation of anticoagulation remains crucial and should not be delayed unless contraindicated. - PERT activation should occur concurrently with implementing treatment recommendations. - The PERT structure varies by institution but may involve specialties such as critical care, pulmonology, cardiology, interventional radiology, and more. - Each member plays a specific role in patient care, from diagnosis and risk stratification to procedures and medication management. The PERT algorithm provides a general framework and may require adaptation based on specific institutional protocols and patient needs. The following steps encompass the PERT approach to the management of pulmonary embolism:\n1. **Patient identification:** Identify patients with suspected or confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, especially submassive or massive cases. Consider low-risk pulmonary embolism with significant contraindications to anticoagulation. 1. **PERT activation:** Trigger activation based on predefined criteria (eg, pulmonary embolism severity and comorbidities). Ensure a precise mechanism for team notification and assembly. 1. **Initial assessment:** The emergency medicine or admitting team performs initial patient evaluation and diagnosis. They gather relevant data such as clinical presentation, risk factors, vital signs, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. 1. **Multidisciplinary consultation:** PERT convenes to discuss the case and treatment options."

Technique or Treatment\nThe EKOS system employs low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a specialized catheter to disaggregate fibrin strands within the clot. This disaggregation increases the clot's permeability, enabling deeper penetration and enhanced efficacy of co-administered thrombolytic agents like rt-PA. Additionally, the ultrasound energy generates microstreaming effects, further facilitating drug transport within the clot. It is essential to take a step-by-step approach to USAT. **Patient Selection and Preparation**\nMeticulous patient selection based on risk stratification and established inclusion/exclusion criteria is paramount for successful US-CDT. Informed consent and pre-procedural imaging, such as echocardiography, are mandatory steps. **Catheter Placement**\nVenous access is typically obtained via the common femoral vein. A guidewire and angiographic catheter navigate to the embolic occlusion in the pulmonary artery. The EKOS-IDDC replaces the angiographic catheter, allowing a precise positioning of the MSD-containing ultrasound transducers within the IDDC. **Treatment Delivery**\nSimultaneous rt-PA infusion and saline coolant administration commence through the IDDC at precisely determined rates. Adjustments based on patient factors, such as weight and comorbidities, may be made to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize complications. Concomitant ultrasound delivery begins, utilizing specific protocols based on institutional guidelines and patient characteristics. Hemodynamic monitoring and continuous ECG are essential throughout the procedure to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy. The initial treatment duration varies depending on institutional protocols and individual patient factors, typically 12 to 24 hours. Rt-PA dose and ultrasound delivery adjustments are tailored to the patient's clinical response and potential complications. Close monitoring for bleeding, compartment syndrome, and other potential complications is crucial throughout the procedure. Upon treatment completion, the EKOS devices are meticulously removed."

Close monitoring for bleeding, compartment syndrome, and other potential complications is crucial throughout the procedure. Upon treatment completion, the EKOS devices are meticulously removed. Clinical Significance\nSystemic thrombolysis remains the standard for high-risk acute pulmonary embolism patients, but its bleeding risk, particularly in older individuals, raises concerns. The optimal strategy remains unclear for those with intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction. Full-dose systemic thrombolysis offers minimal mortality benefits while exposing patients to potential bleeding complications. CDT emerges as a potential game-changer. This precise approach delivers clot-busting medication directly to the blockage, offering the possibility of reduced bleeding by lowering the thrombolytic dose. This makes it particularly attractive for high-risk pulmonary embolism patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis. Early data, though primarily observational, paints a promising picture. CDT reduces right ventricular dysfunction, a key predictor of mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, and shows promise in improving short-term functional limitations and hemodynamic measures. However, definitive recommendations await more robust evidence from ongoing randomized controlled trials like PE-TRACT and HI-PEITHO, which compare CDT to standard anticoagulation in intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism patients. Until then, expert interventional cardiologists must rely on individualized assessments and collaborative decision-making within pulmonary embolism response teams. These teams, empowered by local protocols and resources, can tailor therapy to each patient's needs. Implementing pulmonary embolism response teams and encouraging participation in clinical trials are key to unlocking CDT's full potential and improving outcomes for this vulnerable population."

Implementing pulmonary embolism response teams and encouraging participation in clinical trials are key to unlocking CDT's full potential and improving outcomes for this vulnerable population. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nCDT offers improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe, hemodynamically unstable, massive, or submassive pulmonary embolisms. Without CDT, these patients are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The current guidelines recommend that all healthcare facilities treating pulmonary embolisms establish a PERT. The PERT team is an interprofessional team comprising specialists from various clinical fields, including emergency medicine, critical care, cardiology, internal medicine, radiology, and specialty-trained nurses from critical care, radiology, and emergency care. Clinical pharmacists, especially those trained in critical care, cardiac care, and anticoagulation, are also essential members of this team. Working collaboratively, they can efficiently and effectively deliver CDT to improve patient care. Once CDT is chosen as a management course, the team should counsel the patient and family regarding the procedure's risks and benefits. A trained clinical provider knowledgeable in the risks and benefits should have this discussion with the nurses to ensure informed consent has been obtained. An anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist should then evaluate the patient to determine the need, mode, and safety of anesthetic delivery. An imaging specialist or structuralist may then be consulted for further recommendations on the size and burden of the pulmonary embolism. The emergency care and critical care nurses must assist in monitoring the patient during the procedure and subsequent infusion therapy for hemodynamic or neurologic complications. The clinical pharmacists assist the interventional team by providing appropriate medication and dosing for the procedure. The critical care pharmacist must help the team adjust other concurrent medications to minimize adverse side effects. Multiple studies have shown that the institution of a PERT can reduce adverse events in pulmonary embolism care ."
