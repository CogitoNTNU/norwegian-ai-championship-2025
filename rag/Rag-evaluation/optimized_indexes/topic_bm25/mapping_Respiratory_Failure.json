    "text": "Continuing Education Activity\nAcute abdominal pain is a common emergency room complaint, with causes ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions requiring urgent intervention. The differential diagnosis is broad, including infections, inflammatory processes, vascular occlusion, aortic dissection, bowel obstruction, undiagnosed tumors, or a ruptured viscous. Patients often present with sudden abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, or distension. A thorough history and physical examination, including vital signs and an abdominal assessment, are essential. Signs of peritonitis, shock, or obstruction necessitate urgent evaluation. Clinicians should tailor further diagnostic testing based on clinical presentation while providing appropriate analgesia.\nThis activity for healthcare professionals enhances the learner's understanding of evaluating and managing patients presenting with an acute abdomen. They will learn to differentiate between benign and life-threatening conditions, refine their clinical decision-making skills, and implement evidence-based strategies for imaging utilization. The activity will emphasize the importance of thorough history-taking and physical examination, appropriate use of ultrasound and computed tomography scans, and recognizing critical findings that necessitate urgent intervention. Participants will gain a deeper insight into the condition's clinical manifestations, diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic interventions. Clinicians can optimize patient care, mitigate unnecessary testing, ensure timely and appropriate specialty referrals, improve patient safety, and enhance healthcare outcomes by properly evaluating patients with an acute abdomen. Greater proficiency increases the learner's ability to collaborate within an interprofessional team caring for patients with acute abdominal pain.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify key signs and symptoms indicative of an acute abdomen to facilitate early diagnosis.\n- Differentiate between various causes of acute abdomen, such as surgical and nonsurgical conditions.\n- Implement evidence-based treatment protocols tailored to the underlying cause of acute abdomen.\n- Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to ensure comprehensive patient care and follow-up care plans to monitor recovery and prevent complications."

Introduction\nAcute abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints of patients presenting to the emergency room. Although the underlying cause is often benign, serious underlying pathology may also be present, and clinicians must be able to recognize patients who require urgent evaluation and intervention. The causes of an acute abdomen are diverse, making the differential diagnosis complex. Some potential causes include infections, inflammatory processes, vascular occlusion, aortic dissection, or bowel obstruction. Less apparent sources may involve undiagnosed tumors or a ruptured viscous. Patients typically experience a sudden onset of abdominal pain potentially accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension. The evaluation of acute abdominal pain begins with obtaining a detailed description of the pain, including the location, presence of radiation, timing, quality, severity, aggravating or relieving factors, and associated symptoms. All patients should have their vital signs measured and undergo a complete abdominal examination, including inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation, with the remaining physical examination guided by the patient's history. Patients with an acute abdomen appear acutely ill with such features as shock, peritonitis, guarding, absent bowel sounds, and rebound tenderness. Other findings may include evidence of dehydration, dysuria, vomiting, and altered bowel activity. Patients with unstable vital signs, signs of peritonitis, or suspected life-threatening conditions, such as acute bowel obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, perforation, or ectopic pregnancy, require urgent or surgical evaluation. In addition, patients presenting with fever, jaundice, or right upper quadrant pain should also undergo prompt assessment. A patient presenting with abdominal pain that does not appear acute should similarly undergo thorough questioning. Clinicians should determine further evaluation, including laboratory and imaging, based on symptoms."

A patient presenting with abdominal pain that does not appear acute should similarly undergo thorough questioning. Clinicians should determine further evaluation, including laboratory and imaging, based on symptoms. Etiology\nThe acute abdomen encompasses various potential causes, ranging from gastrointestinal and genitourinary issues to vascular and infectious conditions. Clinicians must obtain a detailed history, perform a thorough physical examination, conduct imaging studies, and obtain laboratory results to identify the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management accurately.\nThe following list includes potential gastrointestinal causes of the acute abdomen:\n- Appendicitis;\n- Perforated peptic ulcer;\n- Acute pancreatitis;\n- Cholecystitis;\n- Diverticulitis;\n- Ruptured diverticulum;\n- Ovarian torsion;\n- Volvulus;\n- Small bowel obstruction;\n- Lacerated spleen or liver; and\n- Ischemic bowel.\nPeritonitis, commonly resulting from bacterial infection, is another potential cause of an acute abdomen. This condition can arise from various conditions, including surgery, organ perforation, pelvic inflammatory disease, ascites, tuberculosis, liver disease, malignancy, trauma, feeding tubes, and peritoneal dialysis. Vascular events causing an acute abdomen are mesenteric ischemia and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Obstetric and gynecologic causes include a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ovarian torsion. Urologic conditions, such as ureteral colic and pyelonephritis, can also present with acute abdominal pain. Newborns and infants can present with conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, and intussusception. The most common cause of acute abdomen in the pediatric population is acute appendicitis."

Newborns and infants can present with conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, and intussusception. The most common cause of acute abdomen in the pediatric population is acute appendicitis. Epidemiology\nAbdominal pain is responsible for 7% to 10% of emergency department visits and accounts for 5 to 10 million patient encounters annually in the United States. Nearly 9% of all pediatric primary care visits are due to acute abdominal pain. A recent retrospective study reveals that nonspecific abdominal pain and renal colic make up nearly 60% of these diagnoses. In patients older than 65, conditions such as diverticulitis and cholecystitis are more common, whereas those younger than 65 are more commonly diagnosed with renal colic and appendicitis.\nAcute abdomen accounts for approximately 14% of patients who present with nontraumatic abdominal pain. The incidence of acute abdomen is higher in males compared to females, with an incidence of 62.61% and 37.39%, respectively. In adults, patients are most commonly affected in their mid to late twenties, with appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and acute pancreatitis being the most common causes. In the pediatric population, the most common etiology of acute abdomen varies by age. In infants, incarcerated inguinal hernia and intussusception are the most common causes, whereas acute appendicitis is the most prevalent in children older than 1."

In infants, incarcerated inguinal hernia and intussusception are the most common causes, whereas acute appendicitis is the most prevalent in children older than 1. Pathophysiology\nClinicians describe abdominal pain as visceral, somatoparietal, or referred depending on the pain receptors involved. **Visceral Pain Receptors**\nVisceral pain receptors are located on serosal surfaces, in the mesentery, within intestinal muscle, and in the mucosa of hollow organs. Stretch is the primary stimulus involved in visceral pain perception. However, additional mechanical and chemical stimuli, such as tension, distention, contraction, traction, compression, torsion, and ischemia, stimulate these receptors. Unmyelinated C-fibers entering the spinal cord bilaterally at multiple levels transmit visceral pain, which patients commonly describe as dull, poorly localized, and felt along the midline. Visceral pain is associated with 3 anatomical pain regions. Pain from foregut structures, such as the lower esophagus and stomach, occurs in the epigastric area; midgut structures, such as the small intestine, in the periumbilical region; and hindgut structures, such as the colon, in the lower abdomen. **Somatoparietal Pain Receptors**\nSomatoparietal pain receptors, located in the parietal peritoneum, the muscle, and the skin, are activated by inflammation, stretching, or tearing. These pain signals are transmitted by myelinated A-\u03b4 fibers to specific dorsal root ganglia. Patients often describe somatoparietal pain as a sharp, more intense, and more localized sensation compared to visceral pain. **Referred Pain**\nReferred pain occurs due to the convergence of afferent neurons from different areas at a shared spinal cord level. When visceral and somatic pain signals converge, the brain cannot distinguish the visceral signals from the more common signals that arise from somatic receptors. As a result, the brain attributes the pain to the more familiar somatic regions rather than the internal organs."

    "text": "**Physical Examination**\nThe physical examination must be focused and completed promptly. Clinicians should note abnormal vital signs and the overall discomfort of the patient. A complete abdominal examination, beginning with inspection, is essential. A patient who is completely immobilized and experiences increased pain when bumped or when the bed is moved is a sign of peritonitis. Writhing in pain is often an indication of ischemia or biliary colic. Clinicians should auscultate bowel sounds before palpating the abdomen, as this may reveal absent or hypoactive bowel sounds. Tinkling, high-pitched sounds often indicate a bowel obstruction. Percussion follows, lightly at first, to identify ascites and hepatomegaly. Patients with peritonitis experience pain with gentle percussion. Tympany signifies a distended bowel, and dullness may indicate a mass. Shifting dullness indicates ascites. Palpation with the examining hand can reveal rebound tenderness and guarding suggestive of peritonitis. Clinicians should note the location of the positive palpatory findings to provide clues to the underlying cause. Classic teaching demands a rectal examination for every patient with abdominal pain. Literature suggests that a rectal examination, at least in appendicitis, adds no helpful information. Indeed, a rectal examination is essential when gastrointestinal bleeding or prostate issues are suspected. A pelvic examination is necessary in females with lower abdominal pain or when clinicians suspect pelvic pathology. A young male with lower abdominal pain needs a testicular examination to exclude testicular torsion. Examination for hernias should be routine. Clinicians should examine the eyes and skin for jaundice. Patients with cardiac or respiratory symptoms must undergo a cardiovascular and respiratory examination. Evidence of extraintestinal manifestations can indicate the presence of inflammatory bowel disease. **Classic Presentation of Abdominal Pain**\nAlthough some causes of abdominal pain have classic presentations, many conditions do not present typically. Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, regardless of the presentation. The following examples are some of the common presentations of acute abdominal pain that require urgent or emergent intervention."

Therefore, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, regardless of the presentation. The following examples are some of the common presentations of acute abdominal pain that require urgent or emergent intervention. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: Most patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm are asymptomatic. If symptomatic, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm typically presents with abdominal, back, or flank pain. The classic presentation of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is severe pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Abdominal obstruction: Clinicians should suspect an intestinal obstruction when a patient presents with pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Classic examination findings include abdominal distension, high-pitched or absent bowel sounds, tenderness, and a tympanic abdomen. Acute appendicitis: The pain of appendicitis typically begins in the periumbilical region and migrates to the right lower quadrant over McBurney's point. Associated symptoms are anorexia, nausea, low-grade fever, and vomiting. Acute cholecystitis: This condition typically presents with severe, persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting more than 4 to 6 hours, accompanied by fever, abdominal guarding, a positive Murphy's sign, and an elevated white blood cell count. Acute cholangitis: Acute cholangitis occurs when a stone occludes the biliary or hepatic ducts and presents with vague right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice, known as Charcot's triad. The obstruction results in dilation and bacterial superinfection of the duct. Acute diverticulitis: Left lower quadrant pain is the most common presenting complaint of acute diverticulitis, although right lower quadrant diverticulitis is also possible. Additional possible associated symptoms are localized guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. A rectal examination may reveal occult blood on stool testing or a mass or tenderness if a distal sigmoid abscess is present. Acute pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis manifests as severe persistent left upper quadrant (LUQ) and epigastric pain radiating to the back. Nausea and vomiting are also commonly associated symptoms. Descending aortic dissection: Aortic dissection can present with chest, back, and abdominal pain. Descending aortic dissections are more likely to cause abdominal pain. Patients may describe the pain as sharp, ripping, or tearing."

Descending aortic dissections are more likely to cause abdominal pain. Patients may describe the pain as sharp, ripping, or tearing. Additional associated symptoms are hypotension, although hypertension is more commonly associated with descending aortic dissections and pulse deficits. Syncope, focal neurological deficits, and acute aortic regurgitation are more commonly associated with ascending aortic dissections. Ectopic pregnancy: First-trimester vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain 6 to 8 weeks after the last menstrual period are the classic presenting features of an ectopic pregnancy. Incarcerated hernia: Incarcerated hernias may be painful to palpation. The overlying skin may be erythematous, and the patient may be febrile. Patients generally do not have peritonitis as the necrotic bowel remains in the incarcerated sac. However, if the incarcerated hernia is reduced, peritoneal signs may develop. Intestinal malrotation with volvulus: Children with intestinal malrotation and volvulus present with abdominal pain, often out of proportion to examination findings, bilious vomiting, peritonitis, hematochezia, abdominal distension, and hemodynamic instability. A cecal or sigmoid volvulus in adults generally presents with a gradual onset of abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, and constipation or constipation but can present with severe acute abdominal pain. Vomiting typically begins a few days after the pain starts. The pain linked to a cecal or sigmoid volvulus is generally persistent and intense, with intermittent colicky episodes occurring during peristalsis. Intussusception: An infant or toddler with an intussusception classically presents with sudden, severe, and progressively worsening abdominal pain. The pain presents as intermittent episodes of inconsolable crying and pulling the legs up toward the abdomen. The episodes generally occur every 15 to 20 min and increase in frequency and intensity. Vomiting is also a common symptom. Initially, the vomit may be nonbilious but often turns bilious as the condition advances. Occasionally, the clinician may palpate a sausage-shaped mass in the right abdomen. Approximately 25% of affected children have bloody stools, but stool guiac is often positive."

Occasionally, the clinician may palpate a sausage-shaped mass in the right abdomen. Approximately 25% of affected children have bloody stools, but stool guiac is often positive. Rarely do the stools appear like the classic currant jelly often described, as this is a late finding due to significant bleeding and sloughing of the mucosa. Mesenteric ischemia: Mesenteric ischemia presents as acute, severe, and diffuse abdominal pain. The pain is often disproportionate to what the clinician finds on examination. Acute colonic ischemia is generally on the left side and associated with hematochezia and tenesmus. At the same time, an arterial embolism to the proximal superior mesenteric artery presents with pain in the periumbilical area. Please see StatPearls' companion reference, \"Acute Mesenteric Ischemia,\" for more information. Necrotizing enterocolitis: The most common sign of necrotizing enterocolitis is a sudden change in feeding tolerance. [](https://www.statpearls.com/keywords/adminreviewdiffs/?id=173117#ref_32855506) Additional findings may include abdominal wall erythema, crepitus, and induration. Infants may also experience apnea, temperature instability, and lethargy. Hypotension and septic shock occur in severe cases. Ovarian torsion: Ovarian torsion manifests as severe pelvic pain, nausea, and vomiting in a patient with an adnexal mass. Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract: Patients with perforation may present with chest, neck, or abdominal pain. The sudden onset of worsening pain after medical instrumentation should alert the clinician to the possibility of perforation. Associated symptoms depend on the organ affected and the contents released. Patients can develop peritonitis, a fistula, or an abscess if the fluid remains contained. Splenic rupture: Splenic rupture is typically due to trauma. Patients may complain of left upper abdominal, left chest wall, or left shoulder pain. Pain referred to the left shoulder that worsens with inspiration is called Kehr's sign and is due to blood adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm irritating the phrenic nerve. Testicular torsion: Testicular torsion typically presents in children and adolescents with severe testicular and lower abdominal pain. Commonly associated symptoms are nausea and vomiting."

Evaluation\nThe history and physical examination guide the diagnostic evaluation of acute abdominal pain. Patients with unstable vital signs, evidence of peritonitis, or suspected life-threatening conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, myocardial infarction, bowel obstruction, abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute mesenteric ischemia, or perforation warrant urgent evaluation in the emergency department. Patients with potential life-threatening abdominal pathology should undergo simultaneous evaluation and resuscitation. Healthcare professionals initially assess the patient's general appearance, airway, breathing, and vital signs. A bedside fingerstick glucose can assess for possible diabetic ketoacidosis, an electrocardiogram assesses for cardiac and electrolyte abnormalities, and a bedside ultrasound is a quick tool used to assess for abdominal aortic aneurysm, hydronephrosis, pericardial effusion, and hemoperitoneum. If the suspected etiology is perforation of an abdominal organ or sepsis due to an abdominal origin, an upright portable chest radiograph is the initial imaging test of choice. If the bedside ultrasound and upright chest radiograph do not provide adequate diagnostic clues, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast is the next step. An abdominal and pelvic ultrasound is the initial imaging modality in pregnant patients evaluating for an intrauterine pregnancy, appendicitis, nephrolithiasis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and uterine rupture. If the ultrasound is not helpful and additional imaging is necessary, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the next step. For less emergent cases, the location of the pain helps guide evaluation, much like it does when developing the differential diagnosis. When examining children, it is essential to consider the child's age and the likely diagnosis. **Right Upper Quadrant Pain**\nRight upper quadrant pain is associated with the liver or biliary tree."

When examining children, it is essential to consider the child's age and the likely diagnosis. **Right Upper Quadrant Pain**\nRight upper quadrant pain is associated with the liver or biliary tree. However, as the liver only becomes painful when its capsule is stretched, the primary causes are related to the biliary tree. Patients with right upper quadrant pain should undergo a thorough workup, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolyte, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, lipase, and amylase. In addition, an abdominal ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice. **Epigastric Pain**\nThe initial evaluation of epigastric pain is the same as that of right upper quadrant pain. Patients with cardiac risk factors and symptoms suggestive of a cardiac issue\u2014such as dyspnea, exertional symptoms, diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting\u2014should undergo an electrocardiogram, troponin testing, and a chest radiograph. Based on the results, further evaluations may include echocardiography, stress testing, coronary CT angiography, and angiography. Endoscopy may be indicated for patients with suspected peptic ulcer disease. **Left Upper Quadrant Pain**\nLUQ pain may be due to underlying splenic or epigastric causes. Patients with splenic pathology likely experience early satiety, abdominal fullness or distension, or pain referred to the chest or left shoulder. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging tool for determining the size of the spleen. A CBC can evaluate for hematologic disorders, whereas serum transaminases assess potential liver involvement. Additional laboratory tests include HIV testing if indicated, blood cultures for suspected infection, and a glucocerebrosidase assay to exclude Gaucher disease. CT or MRI may be necessary for focal lesions such as infarctions or abscesses. Chest radiograph may reveal a pleural effusion associated with a splenic abscess. Additional testing depends on the initial evaluation results, with patients with suspected malignancy requiring bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. **Lower Abdominal Pain**\nLower abdominal pain can arise from the distal colon, pelvis, and testicles. Clinicians must exclude pregnancy in all patients with childbearing potential. Potential pelvic sources of the acute abdomen include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and ovarian torsion."

In addition, clinicians must consider urinary tract obstruction and infection, appendicitis, incarcerated hernia, and diverticulitis.

Suggested diagnostic testing includes the following:\n- CBC for patients with bleeding or signs of infection\n- Type and cross-match for individuals with significant hemorrhage\n- Urinalysis and possibly urine culture for suspected urinary tract infection or acute complicated urinary tract infection\n- Blood cultures for suspected disseminated infection\n- Testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis in patients with risk factors or symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease\n- Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound to assess for free fluid indicating a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, or trauma and locating a pregnancy in patients with a positive pregnancy test\n- CT of the abdomen and pelvis in nonpregnant adults with suspected appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, or nephrolithiasis or when the ultrasound findings are unrevealing\n- Colonoscopy for patients with anemia and abdominal pain to evaluate for colon cancer or subacute abdominal pain and diarrhea to assess for inflammatory bowel disease\n- Scrotal ultrasound for abnormal scrotal examination\n**Diffuse Abdominal Pain**\nDiffuse abdominal pain can be more challenging to diagnose and result from pulmonary, cardiac, or intraabdominal pathologies.

Clinicians can access the criteria at the American College of Radiology's website: . **Children**\nThe evaluation of abdominal pain in children follows a similar approach to adults but requires specific considerations. Clinicians must exclude malrotation, a surgical emergency, in a child younger than 1 who presents with bilious vomiting. Children with abdominal pain and pharyngitis should undergo rapid strep testing. Healthcare professionals infrequently use CT scans of the abdomen in children due to the risks associated with radiation exposure. For children presenting with bilious vomiting, severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, or signs of peritonitis, an abdominal radiograph is usually the initial diagnostic step. This imaging modality swiftly detects perforation through the presence of free air and identifies bowel obstruction by revealing air-fluid levels and distended bowel loops. Ultrasound effectively visualizes intussusception, whereas a contrast enema can diagnose and treat intussusception. An upper gastrointestinal contrast series remains the imaging study of choice for malrotation with volvulus. Children who present with classic signs of appendicitis should undergo evaluation by a pediatric surgeon before undergoing imaging. If the presentation is atypical or the examination findings are unclear, imaging with abdominal ultrasound is preferred."

Treatment / Management\nClinicians initiate resuscitation alongside the initial evaluation, not delaying specialty consultation while awaiting imaging results. They promptly attach patients to a cardiac monitor and treat those with peritonitis, hypotension, or a toxic appearance by establishing large-bore IV access, administering crystalloid fluids, and using vasopressors for septic shock. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or chronic glucocorticoid use receive stress-dose steroids, and patients with evidence of hypovolemia and hemorrhage receive blood products. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic enteric organisms are necessary when infection, peritoneal contamination, or sepsis is suspected.\nHealthcare professionals should remember that adequate pain management is essential and does not alter the assessment. Potential interventions include acetaminophen, parenteral ketorolac, and opioids. Clinicians must exercise caution with ketorolac, as it can exacerbate gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and acute kidney injury. The diagnosis dictates further intervention and specialty consultation. Typical specialty involvement includes general or vascular surgery, gynecology, interventional radiology, urology, and gastroenterology. Patients with suspected perforation and pneumoperitoneum on initial radiographs warrant immediate surgical referral.

Because the differential diagnoses for abdominal pain are extensive, providing information regarding the symptoms of potentially life-threatening causes will help guide patients on when to seek immediate medical care. Patients should understand that the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain is a sign of a potentially serious underlying condition. Additional symptoms that should raise concern are nausea, vomiting, fever, blood in the stool or vomit, dark, tarry stools, or pain that worsens when someone bumps them or if they hit a bump in the road while riding in the car. Symptoms unique to children may be inconsolable crying or intermittent colicky pain.\nPatients can lower their risk of acute abdomen by adopting a healthy lifestyle, consuming a well-balanced diet, and limiting alcohol and tobacco use. Additionally, regularly monitoring chronic conditions such as gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease, along with following recommended screening guidelines for colon cancer and abdominal aortic aneurysms, can help prevent its occurrence. Clinicians should educate patients taking high-risk medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on the signs of adverse effects like peptic ulcer disease and when to seek medical care. Healthcare professionals must educate patients on the importance of following postoperative instructions. Proper patient education can prevent postoperative complications like wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism."

Proper patient education can prevent postoperative complications like wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nSevere, often rapid onset abdominal pain that necessitates prompt evaluation and management characterizes an acute abdomen. Clinically, it may manifest as localized or diffuse pain, peritoneal signs such as guarding and rebound tenderness, hemodynamic instability, and associated symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fever, or altered bowel habits. A comprehensive history and physical examination, focusing on pain characteristics and risk factors, guide the initial diagnostic and management approach. Laboratory tests and imaging studies aid in diagnosis, with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria as a valuable tool in selecting the most effective imaging modality. These criteria enhance care quality, optimize radiology use, minimize unnecessary radiation exposure, and prevent diagnostic delays.\nManagement varies based on the underlying etiology, ranging from supportive care and antibiotics for infections to urgent surgical intervention for conditions such as perforation, ischemia, or obstruction. Early consultation with surgeons and other specialists and serial reassessments are crucial to preventing complications.\nWhile surgeons often play a central role, an interdisciplinary healthcare team is essential for optimal patient outcomes. Nurses contribute by monitoring vital signs, pain levels, and postoperative recovery, including bowel function and wound healing. Pharmacists ensure appropriate analgesic, antiemetic, and antibiotic selection and dosing. Radiologists are instrumental in diagnosing underlying causes and providing interventional therapies when needed, while physical therapists facilitate early ambulation and functional recovery.\nEffective interprofessional communication is vital for seamless collaboration and coordinated care. Healthcare professionals must exchange relevant patient information, discuss treatment plans, and address concerns promptly to ensure timely and appropriate management. By integrating their expertise, fostering teamwork, and emphasizing clear communication, physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals can enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and optimize team performance in managing acute abdominal conditions."

In 2017, in the United States of America, however, the incidence of respiratory failure was found to be 1,275 cases per 100,000 adults. The case definition used in this study included all diagnosis codes that included respiratory failure as a component. The epidemiology of respiratory failure is dependent mainly on the cause leading to the failure. Below, we list some common causes of respiratory failure and the relevant trends:\n- Acute myocardial infarction-related (AMI-RF): Between the years 2000 and 2014, 439,436 admissions due to AMI-RF were noted in 57% and required mechanical ventilation in 43% of total cases.\n- Acute respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ranges in incidence from 10-80/100,000/y based on where it is recorded worldwide. This is partly due to different practices and thresholds for intubation in these cases and the use of different definitions of ARDs. According to one report, it is estimated that 10% of all patients admitted to ICU and 23% of mechanically ventilated patients meet ARDS criteria.\n- Acute respiratory failure related to Coronavirus (COVID-19): It is estimated early in the COVID-19 pandemic that up to 79% of hospitalized patients developed respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.\n- Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is the third most common etiology in patients hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure."

Pathophysiology\n**T** **ype 1 respiratory failure:**\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Type 1 respiratory failure is a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg with a normal or decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). Depending on the cause of hypoxemia, the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient may be normal or increased. Formulas of the A-a gradient and alveolar gas equation are provided below, as these concepts are helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure. A-a gradient:\n- A-a gradient = PAO2 - PaO2, where\n- PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen\n- PaO2 = Arterial partial pressure of oxygen\nAlveolar gas equation:\n- PAO2 = FiO2 (PB - Pwater) - PaCO2/0.8, or PIo2= (PB - 47) \u00d7 FIo2,\n- PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen\n- FiO2 = Fraction of inspired oxygen\n- PB = Barometric (Atmospheric) pressure\n- Pwater = Vapor pressure of water at body temperature (37\u00b0C)=47 mmHg\n- PaCO2 = Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide\nEtiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with normal A-a gradients include:\n- **Alveolar hypoventilation:** Alveolar hypoventilation increases the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that an increase in PaCO2 causes a decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2). In this situation, the A-a gradient is normal, as the PAO2 and PaO2 decrease in equal magnitudes. When severe, alveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure. (as discussed later in this section under Type 2 respiratory failure)."

(as discussed later in this section under Type 2 respiratory failure). - **Low atmospheric pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen:** The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) decreases with low atmospheric pressures (Patm) and with low levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In either situation, the A-a gradient remains normal, and the PaCO2 is decreased, given the response to hypoxia is hyperventilation. Clinically, this cause of respiratory failure occurs at high altitudes. Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with increased A-a gradients include:\n- **Diffusion defect:** Gas exchange between the environment and the body occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. Structural changes to the alveolar component of the alveolar-capillary interface, such as decreased surface area or increased thickness, may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. Additionally, reducing pulmonary capillary transit time through the alveolar-capillary interface may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. In either situation, hypercapnia does not occur, as carbon dioxide diffuses more readily across the alveolar-capillary membrane than oxygen. Etiologies of diffusion defects include:\n- Emphysema\n- Interstitial lung disease\n- ****Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch:**** The alveolar gas composition depends on the balance of alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary blood flow that occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. When perfectly matched, the V/Q ratio is equal to one. When ventilation is excessive to perfusion, the V/Q ratio is greater than one; Dead space ventilation occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches infinity. When perfusion is excessive to ventilation, the V/Q ratio is less than one; Shunt occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches zero. In healthy subjects, however, the V/Q ratio is approximately 0.8, as the balance between ventilation and perfusion differs from the apex to the base of the lungs. V/Q mismatch is the most common cause of Type 1 respiratory failure. Etiologies of V/Q mismatch include:\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n- Congestive heart failure\n- Pulmonary embolism\n- ****Right-to-left shunt:**** As discussed above, shunt occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches zero."

The absence of gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary interface represents a true shunt and is analogous to intracardiac right-to-left shunting seen in atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale. Unlike V/Q mismatch, true shunt does not improve with supplemental oxygen therapy. Etiologies of pulmonary right-to-left shunts include:\n- Arteriovenous malformation\n- Complete atelectasis\n- Severe pneumonia\n- Severe pulmonary edema\n**Type 2 Respiratory Failure**\nHypercapnic respiratory failure is defined as an increase in arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) (PaCO)> 45 mmHg with a pH < 7.35 due to respiratory pump failure and/or increased CO2 production. In general, according to the modified alveolar ventilation equation, the PaCO2 level is proportionally related to the rate of CO2 production (VCO2) and inversely associated with the rate of CO2 elimination (i.e., alveolar ventilation) (PaCO2 =VCO2 /VA). The relationship between minute ventilation and CO2 production in response to exercise can be affected by age and pregnancy. Alveolar ventilation (VA) is the product of minute ventilation (VE) and the ratio of dead space (VD) to tidal volume (Vt) (VA = VE x [1 - VD/Vt]). While decreased VA is the most common reason for the respiratory failure of hypercapnia, increased CO2 production is a very rare reason. Depending on the cause of respiratory failure, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) may be normal or decreased. The two main paradigms responsible for hypercapnia respiratory failure are either manifested by \"won't breathe\" due to a central drive issue or \"can't breathe\" as a result of a peripheral neuromuscular defect, resistive loading (narrow airway) or restrictive defect that lead to hypoventilation and hypercapnia. **Respiratory pump failure:** The respiratory pump is comprised of the chest wall, the pulmonary parenchyma, the muscles of respiration, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. The inability to ventilate can occur if any of the components mentioned above of the respiratory pump fails."

Hypoventilation typically occurs once dead space ventilation exceeds 50% of total ventilation. - Muscle abnormalities: Diaphragmatic paralysis, diffuse atrophy, muscular dystrophy, and ruptured diaphragm may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation. **Increased dead space:** Dead space (VD) refers to areas of the lung that are not anatomically or physiologically able to exchange gas. Tachypnea can contribute to high CO2 by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/Vt). High alveolar VA and the associated ventilation-perfusion mismatch are considered one of the main mechanisms for developing hypercapnia in individuals with COPD. **Increased CO production:** CO2 is a by-product of oxidative metabolism, and high CO2 production may occur due to fever, exercise, hyperalimentation, sepsis, and thyrotoxicosis. High CO2 production becomes pathologic if the compensatory increase in minute ventilation mechanism fails. **Alveolar hypoventilation: A** lveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure.

History and Physical\nRespiratory failure is a syndrome with a myriad of etiologies; therefore, a thorough history and physical examination are required to narrow the differential diagnosis. **History**\nPatients typically present with respiratory symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, and wheezing); however, symptoms from other organ systems (ie, chest pain, decreased appetite, heartburn, fever, and significant weight loss) are important. Loss of smell and/or exposure to sick people or unprotect contact with individuals with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is essential in suspecting COVID-19 illness and associated respiratory failure, particularly in high-risk patients (older patients, men, and morbidly obese). For a specific population, the presence of immunocompromised conditions or taking immunosuppressants is also essential in risk-stratifying patients at risk for respiratory failure early on. For patients already diagnosed with airway disease, it is important to assess inhaler compliance and technique, recent steroid use, as well as exposure to environmental triggers. For patients with hypertension and chronic cough, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be investigated. Social history is also crucial when considering respiratory failure. Alcohol use and sexually transmitted diseases may lead to an immunocompromised state, making patients more susceptible to certain infections, while a sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism. Habits such as having birds and hobbies such as diving and flying may have implications when considering etiologies of respiratory failure. Most importantly, a patient's tobacco smoking history should be investigated, including exposure to second-hand smoke, marijuana smoking, smoking e-cigarettes, and vaping."

As such, a single algorithm for evaluating respiratory failure does not exist. Appropriate diagnostic studies may include laboratory assays (i.e., complete blood count with the differential, comprehensive metabolic panel with magnesium/phosphorous, procalcitonin, troponin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone), infectious workup (i.e., blood cultures, sputum cultures, respiratory pathogen panel test, and urinary antigen test), and 12-lead electrocardiography. Evaluation of respiratory failure with arterial blood gas, capnometry, radiography, pulse oximetry, and ultrasonography are discussed below. **Arterial Blood Gas**\nArterial blood gas (ABG) is the gold standard for diagnosing respiratory failure. At a minimum, the information obtained from an ABG includes pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and serum bicarbonate (HCO3). It should be noted that the HCO3 obtained from an ABG is a calculated value and may, therefore, be inaccurate. Analysis of an ABG should instead be performed using a measured HCO3 obtained from a basic metabolic panel. Oxygenation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaO2. Hypoxemia is defined as a PaO2 less than 60 mmHg. Ventilation is assessed through the interpretation of the PaCO2. Hypercapnia is defined as a PaCO2 greater than 45 mmHg. Information from the ABG can also be used to differentiate acute from chronic respiratory failure by evaluating the renal response to PaCO2. In respiratory acidosis, the kidneys respond by increasing the absorption of HCO3 in the proximal convoluted tube. As this is a slow process, the magnitude of HCO3 absorption in acute respiratory acidosis is less than the magnitude of HCO3 absorption in chronic respiratory acidosis. This difference allows for the distinction between the chronicity in acute and chronic respiratory failure. **Capnometry**\nCapnometry, the measurement of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas, may be qualitative or quantitative."

Colorimetric capnometry is a qualitative measure of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas that relies on the color change of a pH-sensitive indicator. Infrared capnometry is a quantitative measure of carbon dioxide in exhaled gas that relies on measuring the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Quantitative capnometry provides more information than qualitative capnometry. In the non-pathological state, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the end of expiration, or end-tidal pCO2 (PETCO2), approximates the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood (PaCO2). The PaCO2 is typically 2 to 3 mmHg greater than the PETCO2. In the pathological state, where gas exchange is impaired, the difference between the PaCO2 and PETCO2 becomes greater than 3 mmHg due to increased dead space ventilation. Values obtained from quantitative capnometry can be plotted graphically and displayed as waveform capnography. Analysis of these waveforms allows for detecting pathological states (i.e., apnea, bronchospasm, hyperventilation, and hypoventilation). **Radiography**\nVarious imaging modalities are available for the evaluation of respiratory failure. Such options include plain films, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, angiography, and ultrasonography. **Pulse Oximetry**\nPulse oximetry relies on spectrophotometry, the process of identifying the composition of a substance via measurement of the absorption of specific wavelengths of light transmitted through the substance in question. The composition and structural configuration of hemoglobin are dependent upon molecular oxygen. In the tense state, oxygenated hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen. In the relaxed state, deoxygenated hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the conformational states of the hemoglobin molecule as deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs light at wavelengths of 660 nm, and oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs light at wavelengths of 940 nm. Measurement of arterial oxygenation is ensured through the analysis of pulsatile blood. Proprietary algorithms allow for the conversion of light absorption to the fraction of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen, known as oxygen saturation (SpO2)."

The protocol allows for reproducible analysis and relies on standardized thoracic locations (BLUE points) and ten ultrasonographic signs or profiles. The BLUE protocol is performed by analyzing the ultrasonographic profiles obtained at each of the three BLUE points on each side of the body. The standardized BLUE points are known as the Upper BLUE point, the Lower BLUE point, and the postero-lateral alveolar and/or pleural syndrome (PLAPS)-point. In total, there are six BLUE points.

Treatment / Management\nTreatment of respiratory failure should be directed towards the underlying cause while providing support with oxygenation and ventilation, if necessary. The treatment includes supportive measures and treatment of the underlying cause. However, the initial steps in managing patients with acute respiratory failure should start by assessing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). Supportive measures depend on patent airways to maintain adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and correction of blood gas abnormalities. **Correction of Hypoxemia**\nThe goal is to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation, generally achieved with an arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 60 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), about 90%. Uncontrolled oxygen supplementation can result in oxygen toxicity and CO2 (carbon dioxide) narcosis. The inspired oxygen concentration should be adjusted at the lowest level (90-94%), which is sufficient for tissue oxygenation. Oxygen can be delivered by several routes depending on the clinical situations in which we may use a nasal cannula, simple face mask, nonrebreathing mask, or high-flow nasal cannula. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be needed in refractory cases. **Correction of Hypercapnia and Respiratory Acidosis**\nThis may be achieved by treating the underlying cause or providing ventilatory support. **Ventilatory Support**\nPatients with severe acute respiratory failure are usually intubated."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nDiagnosing the underlying cause of respiratory failure and its treatment is challenging as this syndrome can result from numerous pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes. Therefore, consultation with other specialties (i.e., cardiology and neurology) may be mandatory. Moreover, discussing radiographic findings with a radiologist can sometimes be necessary. Additionally, complications from respiratory failure may be due to improper patient positioning and poor adherence to infection control policies. Fortunately, nurses are vital interprofessional healthcare team members, assuring appropriate patient positioning. Nursing is also responsible for feeding, monitoring, and suctioning the patient and can offer patient counseling while serving as a contact point for the various specialties involved in the case. All interprofessional team members are responsible for keeping meticulous records of every interaction and intervention with the patient so that every care team member has access to the same accurate, updated patient information.\nSince patients with respiratory failure may require multiple medications, the pharmacist is instrumental in ensuring safe medication administration, medication reconciliation, answering drug questions for the care team, and providing medication counseling for the patient. Finally, respiratory therapists also care for a patient with respiratory failure (i.e., administration of oxygen and chest physiotherapy). All interprofessional team members must engage in meticulous documentation and report any changes in patient status to the appropriate team members for possible corrective action. This interprofessional team works to improve patient care and outcomes through collaborative activity and open communication."
