    "text": "Indications\nIn patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM, beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are used first at maximally tolerated doses. Either adding disopyramide to the regimen or SRT should be considered in patients who continue to have symptoms despite medical management. However, patients' preferences, age, and comorbid conditions should be considered when selecting the type of SRT. Surgical myomectomy is recommended for symptomatic patients requiring cardiac surgery for other conditions like multi-vessel coronary artery diseases (CAD), hemodynamically significant valvular disease at a comprehensive HCM center by experienced surgeons. As an alternative, ASA is recommended in comprehensive HCM centers by an experienced operator for prohibitive or high surgical risk patients with associated comorbid conditions or advanced age or patients refusing open-heart surgery.\nThe following criteria have to be met before considering ASA:\n1. Septal reduction therapy is recommended in patients with clinical symptoms like severe dyspnea or chest pain (NYHA III or class IV), or symptoms like presyncope or syncope during exertion interfering with daily activities due to LVOT obstruction and peak gradient of \u226550mmHg at rest or with provocation in patients with septal hypertrophy and SAM of mitral valves.\n1. Targeted anterior septal wall thickness>15mm. Septal thickness>30mm results in a suboptimal outcome.\n1. A septal perforator perfuses the septal area of interest, causing dynamic LVOT obstruction and gradient.\n1. No significant CAD."

A septal perforator perfuses the septal area of interest, causing dynamic LVOT obstruction and gradient. 1. No significant CAD. Technique or Treatment\nA temporary transvenous pacemaker should be placed and kept for 2 or 3 days after the procedure. Dual arterial access should be obtained. A 6F or 7F left coronary guide catheter is used to engage the left main coronary artery, and another access is used to introduce a 5F or 6F pigtail catheter to the left ventricle for measurement of the ventricle, LVOT, and aortic gradients. A coronary wire is advanced to the first septal perforator via a guide catheter in the left main. Then, the wire balloon (OTW) is advanced over the wire and inflated at the proximal portion of the septal perforator to occlude the vessel completely.\nAfter that, the dye is injected into the septal branch to ensure no reflux into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and no collaterals supplied by this septal branch. Echocardiographic contrast dye is injected into the septal branch to spot the area of interest by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). After delineating the targeted myocardium, 1 to 2 cc of absolute alcohol is injected into the septal perforator via an OTW balloon. Left ventrical to the aorta and LVOT gradients are measured by pigtail and TTE, respectively. Another 1 to 2 cc alcohol infusion can be repeated if a \\<50% reduction in gradients is noted. The OTW balloon should be inflated 10 minutes after the last alcohol infusion. Then, a coronary angiogram is performed to view LAD for any unintended consequences."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nASA performed by experienced interventional cardiologists in comprehensive HCM centers undoubtedly enhances procedural outcomes. Studies have shown the overall mortality from the procedures is \\<1% and the survival rate is similar to surgical myomectomy. Appropriate patient selection is the key to procedural success. Highly trained nursing staff aids in identifying potentially life-threatening complications, augmenting the need for immediate intervention. A skilled and experienced surgeon should also be on standby to handle any potential procedure-related complications. This requires collaborating with qualified staff support and a multidisciplinary team at every level to achieve great procedural success. A full discussion of the available treatment options should be held with symptomatic patients.\nThe success rates, risks, and benefits should be explained in detail. Referral to centers with comprehensive HCM care and excellent clinical outcomes should be appropriate for eligible SRT patients. For severely symptomatic eligible patients with LVOT obstruction due to HCM, SRT can be performed as an alternative to an escalation of medical therapy after shared decision-making and explaining the risks and benefits of all available treatment options."

    "text": "Pathophysiology\nMany cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are due to idiopathic etiology. But, it also can arise from various myocardial insults. Enlargement of the ventricles can either be secondary to LV failure or secondary to a primary cardiomyopathic process and can be associated with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Reduction in systolic function is believed to be caused by myocardial remodeling that results in an increase in both end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes.\nThe progressive dilatation of the ventricles leads to significant tricuspid and mitral valve insufficiency, which further lower the ejection fraction and increase the ventricular wall stress and end systolic volumes. Early compensatory mechanisms include an increase in heart rate and tone of the peripheral vascular system. However, these compensatory mechanisms lead to geometric remodeling of the ventricles and eventually this leads to worsening of the myocardial injury. At the same time, there is neurohumoral activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system and an increase in circulating levels of catecholamines. In addition, levels of natriuretic peptides are also increased. Eventually these compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed and the heart fails.\nHistologic examination or the myocardium typically shows nonspecific changes of fibrosis and hypertrophy. It also reveals myocardial injury with a marked infiltrate by inflammatory cells."

Histologic examination or the myocardium typically shows nonspecific changes of fibrosis and hypertrophy. It also reveals myocardial injury with a marked infiltrate by inflammatory cells. History and Physical\nThe majority of cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) present between the ages of 20 and 60; however, DCM can be seen in children or the elderly. A large number of patients with DCM may have a long latent period where they are clinically asymptomatic. When symptoms do arise, they are the result of LV systolic dysfunction. In addition to a focused cardiac history and examination, a more thorough evaluation is recommended to identify any systemic disease or secondary causes.\nClassic symptoms include paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, malaise, and weakness also can be present. More severe cases can present with thromboembolic complications, conduction disturbances, arrhythmias or even sudden cardiac death. Physical examination findings are largely not specific to other causes of cardiomyopathy and consist of typical findings seen with congestive heart failure.\nFindings include crackles in the lung fields, elevated jugular venous pressures, peripheral edema, and an S3 gallop. Classically, the point of maximum impulse or PMI is displaced laterally. Tricuspid or mitral regurgitation murmurs are not uncommon as a result of ventricular enlargement and annular dilation. Neck examination may reveal jugular venous distension, A-wave, large V waves, and positive hepatojugular reflux."

Neck examination may reveal jugular venous distension, A-wave, large V waves, and positive hepatojugular reflux. Evaluation\nEvaluation for secondary causes of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) always should be pursued prior to making the diagnosis of idiopathic DCM. Workup is focused on identifying any possible reversible causes. Recommended laboratory testing includes thyroid function tests, HIV serology, electrolytes, and iron studies (to rule out hemochromatosis). Urine toxicology screen and alcohol level can be checked when substance abuse is suspected. In certain familial cases, genetic testing should be considered. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels may be obtained in cases where the diagnosis is unclear. Low levels of BNP are useful in ruling out CHF. In addition, levels of BNP are useful for prognosis.\nOne should also rule out hypothyroidism and anemia.\nChest X-ray may show cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary effusions and venous congestion. Electrocardiogram (EKG) may show nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities. ECG may also reveal atrial fibrillation.\nOxygen consumption per minute of less than 14 ml/kg/min indicates a poor prognosis.\nEchocardiography is crucial in making the diagnosis of DCM and provides an objective assessment of ventricular size, function, and any associated valvular abnormalities. Echocardiography also can identify the presence of a mural thrombus. Finally, echocardiography can help in differentiating DCM from hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy.\nCoronary angiography should be performed in those without a known history of CAD to further define coronary anatomy and rule out occult ischemic disease as the cause of DCM. Very rarely, a myocardial biopsy is needed for the evaluation of storage diseases or infiltrative causes when suspected. As mentioned, histologic findings of idiopathic DCM are nonspecific, and biopsy exposes patients to unnecessary risk."

As mentioned, histologic findings of idiopathic DCM are nonspecific, and biopsy exposes patients to unnecessary risk. Treatment / Management\nBesides treating any identifiable and reversible underlying causes, the management and treatment of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) are in concordance with the standard heart failure guidelines. In patients with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation, intravenous loop diuretics are given to treat hypervolemia. Management of chronic and stable disease with oral diuretics often is needed to achieve a euvolemic state. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have shown benefit in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and are recommended in patients with DCM. Aldosterone receptor blockade with spironolactone or eplerenone also is recommended in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure class II-IV and systolic dysfunction. Similarly, beta-blockade with carvedilol, bisoprolol, or long-acting metoprolol is recommended in all patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction without any contraindications. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine also has shown to increase survival amongst those with advanced disease. Anticoagulation should be used for patients with artificial valves, atrial fibrillation, and known mural thrombus. Oral anticoagulants can reduce the risk of stroke, but the risk of bleeding is always present. Finally, patients with disease refractory to maximum medical therapy should be considered for cardiac transplantation and LVAD as a bridge or for \"destination\" therapy in those who are not candidates for transplantation. Implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can be considered and are recommended by the heart failure guidelines. A heart transplant is an option but the lack of donors is a major stumbling block."

A heart transplant is an option but the lack of donors is a major stumbling block. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a progressive heart disorder with no cure. Eventually, most patients progress to heart failure and close to 50% are dead within five years. Today many treatments have been devised for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy, but for most of them, there is a lack of evidence to support their use. There is no longer any question that this disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that specializes in heart disease. The three single most important factors that determine the prognosis are 1) diet, 2) medication compliance, and 3) an exercise program. The disorder should be risk-stratified and managed accordingly. A dietitian or a nurse is vital because one of the best ways to prevent progression to heart failure is by restricting fluid and salt intake. The family must be told to weigh the patient and offer foods that are low in salt. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient remains compliant with the medications. There is ample evidence indicating that participating in an exercise program can reduce symptoms and lower all-cause mortality. If the patient is deemed to be a candidate for a heart transplant, the heart transplant team should be consulted early on. Close communication between the team is vital if one wants to improve outcomes. **Outcomes**\nThe outcomes of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy depend on the cause, ejection fraction, and comorbidity. At least 50% are dead within five years, and many others go on to develop heart failure. Despite many treatments available, the majority remain experimental."

    "text": "Pathophysiology\nAlcohol-induced cardiotoxicity can be characterized by acute and chronic. Acute can be defined as large volume acute consumption of alcohol promotes myocardial inflammation leading to increased troponin concentration in serum, tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and rarely ventricular fibrillation. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause multi-organ damage including myocardial dysfunction. There are no specific targeted histological or immunological biomarkers for the diagnosis of alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy. The key diagnostic element is the absence of coronary artery disease. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated in the development of cardiomyopathy however one key factor undergoing active research is the role of genetic mutation and susceptibility to develop cardiomyopathy. The postulated mechanism includes mitochondria damage, oxidative stress injury, apoptosis, modification of actin and myosin structure, and alteration of calcium homeostasis. Alcohol consumption causes an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Studies have shown an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in myocytes following alcohol consumption and thus causes oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA leading to cardiac dysfunction. These changes are related to both direct alcohol toxicity on cardiac cells and the indirect toxicity of major alcohol metabolites such as acetaldehyde. The pathogenesis of ACM also involves interaction between genetically related factors, such as HLA subtypes or the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme allele as well as non-genetic factors including thiamine deficiency and exposure of various substances that are directly toxic to cardiac cells. These structural and intracellular alterations cause activation in compensatory mechanisms in response to cardiac dysfunction such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increase sympathetic signal firing and an increase in brain natriuretic peptide release. These mechanisms are responsible for an increase in preload, left ventricular dilation, and decreased cardiac output which all contribute to the clinical manifestation of ACM. A study by Ware et al."
