    "text": "History and Physical\nClinical presentation often begins as a mild allergic reaction. The primary symptoms depend on the mode of exposure to the causative antigen. While cutaneous flushing with pruritus and urticaria are common, they may not develop until after respiratory symptoms occur, which is common in oral exposures. Fullness or a \"lump in the throat,\" persistent clearing of the throat, or difficulty breathing are all concerning symptoms of anaphylaxis and should be treated aggressively. Other respiratory symptoms include hoarseness, wheezing, and stridor. Rapid treatment should be initiated with intramuscular epinephrine if any of these symptoms are present. Anaphylaxis is a rapidly evolving presentation, usually within 1 hour of exposure. Roughly half of the anaphylactic-related fatalities occur within this first hour; therefore, the first hour after the initial symptom onset is the most crucial for treatment. It is important to note that the more rapid the onset and progression of symptoms, the more severe the disease process. Morbidity and mortality are most often related to loss of airway and distributive shock. Early recognition and aggressive treatment greatly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The first hour is not the only time of concern, however, as anaphylactic reactions can also occur biphasically in up to 20% of cases. Even after successful management of the initial presenting symptoms, there can be a recurrence of symptoms peaking 8 to 11 hours after the initial reaction. While the biphasic response is only clinically significant in 4 to 5% of patients with diagnosed anaphylaxis, the potentially fatal second reaction should not be dismissed after treatment of the initial reaction. While most of the focus is on the above symptoms of respiratory, cutaneous, and hypotension, it is important to understand and evaluate for any other signs of end-organ damage from hypo-perfusion. This may include abdominal pain and cramps, vomiting, hypotonia, syncope, or incontinence. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms occur in 25 to 30% of patients."

Evaluation\nDiagnosing anaphylaxis is clinical; thus, laboratory studies or other diagnostics are unnecessary. Most anaphylactic deaths occur within the first hour after antigen exposure. Rapid recognition and action are imperative. Consideration for anaphylaxis is appropriate in the presence of 2 or more involved systems, even in the absence of airway involvement or hypotension (see above). A consensus criterion has been constructed to improve clinical recognition to prevent delayed treatment, as this poses a great risk to patients. See **Image. ** Anaphylaxis. **Clinical Criteria for Anaphylaxis (1 of the following with onset within minutes to hours)**\n_Unknown exposure to an antigen yet rapidly developing urticaria or other skin/mucosal layer symptoms associa_ _ted with any 1 of the following:_\n1. Respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia, inability to maintain patency; persistent cough or throat clearing can be heralding symptoms)\n1.

It is not required to meet these criteria to treat; it is only to serve as a guide for diagnosis. Angioedema can also mimic these symptoms. A key differentiation between angioedema and anaphylaxis is urticaria; the oral symptoms and need for airway control can otherwise mimic each other. When in doubt, treat aggressively. Laboratory testing is of little to no use, as there is no accurate testing for diagnosis or confirmation. Serum histamine is of no use due to transient elevation and late presentation. Serum tryptase can be considered for confirmation of an anaphylactic episode as it remains elevated for several hours; however, as a diagnostic modality, this has low sensitivity. Kounis syndrome (allergic angina): This is myocardial infarction or ischemia that can occur in the setting of anaphylaxis."

Kounis syndrome (allergic angina): This is myocardial infarction or ischemia that can occur in the setting of anaphylaxis. Treatment / Management\n**Triage**\nTriage any allergic reaction with urgency as they are at risk for rapid deterioration with the development of anaphylaxis, if not already anaphylactic. **Airway**\nAirway management is paramount. Thoroughly examine the patient for airway patency or any indications of an impending loss of airway. Perioral edema, stridor, and angioedema are very high risk, and obtaining a definitive airway is imperative. Delay may reduce the chances of successful intubation as continued swelling occurs, increasing the risk for a surgical airway. **Decontamination**\nAfter the airway is secured, decontaminating offending agents (if known) is the next priority to prevent continued exposure and clinical worsening. Remove any stingers, if present. Do not attempt gastric lavage in cases of ingestion, as this may not be effective and delays treatment. **Epinephrine**\nEpinephrine is given through intramuscular injection and at a dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1,000 concentration of epinephrine. Pediatric dosing is 0.01 mg/kg or 0.15 mg intramuscularly (epinephrine injection for pediatric dosage). Intramuscular delivery has proven to provide more rapid delivery and produce better outcomes than subcutaneous or intravascular. Note if intravenous epinephrine is to be given, the concentration required is 1:10,000; see the next paragraph. The thigh is preferred to the deltoid when possible. Repeat studies have shown that providers often wait too long before giving epinephrine; it is the treatment of choice, and the rapid benefit much outweighs the risks of withholding treatment. While most patients require only a single dose, repeat doses may be given every 5 to 10 minutes as needed until symptoms improve."

While most patients require only a single dose, repeat doses may be given every 5 to 10 minutes as needed until symptoms improve. If patients require multiple doses, a continuous infusion of epinephrine may be considered; start an initial intravenous infusion of 0.1 mg of 1:10,000, given over 5 to 10 minutes. If more is required, begin infusion at 1 microgram per minute and titrate to effect. Stop intravenous infusion if arrhythmia or chest pain develops. The risk of cardiovascular complications is much greater for intravenous epinephrine. For beta-blocked patients, close blood pressure monitoring is suggested due to the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects from epinephrine. **IV Fluid Resuscitation**\nAnaphylaxis induces a distributive shock that typically is responsive to fluid resuscitation and the above epinephrine. One to 2 L or 10 to 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid bolus should be given for observed hypotension. Albumin or hypertonic solutions are not indicated. **Adjunctive Therapies**\nWhen anaphylaxis is diagnosed, co-treatment is often initiated with steroids, antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators, and vasopressors. Glucagon can also be used if indicated. These agents can assist in refractory initial anaphylaxis or prevent recurrence and biphasic reactions. **Corticosteroids**\nCorticosteroids are given to reduce the length or biphasic response of anaphylaxis. There is minimal literature to support this use, specifically in anaphylaxis, but it has been proven effective in reactive airway diseases. Therefore, the use, dosages, and proposed mechanism of action mimic those of airway management protocols. Methylprednisolone (80 to 125 mg IV) or hydrocortisone (250 to 500 mg IV) are the accepted treatments during the acute phase, after which oral treatment of prednisone (40 to 60 mg daily or divided twice per day) is continued for 3 to 5 days. Again, if the source is unknown or there is a concern for a prolonged time before physician follow-up, a steroid taper of up to 2 weeks may be provided. Mineralocorticoid activity is responsible for fluid retention; dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are the preferred agents for those at risk as they induce the least mineralocorticoid effect."

While the clinical benefit is unproven in anaphylaxis, its utility is evident in more minor allergic processes. In severe cases, H2 blockers such as famotidine 20 mg intravenous (given over 2 minutes) or cimetidine (300 mg IV) may also be used in conjunction with H-\u00adblocker as there is evidence suggesting histamine has crossover selectivity of receptors. Note that cimetidine has multiple precautions in at-risk populations such as renal or hepatic impaired patients or those taking beta-blockers. While intravenous is the initial route during stabilization, once the patient is stabilized, they may be switched to oral if continued therapy is desired. **Bronchodilators**\nBronchodilators are useful adjuncts in patients with bronchospasm. Patients with previous histories of respiratory disease, most notably asthma, are at the highest risk. Treated with inhaled beta-agonists is the first-line treatment for wheezing; albuterol alone or as ipratropium bromide/albuterol. If there is refractory wheezing, intravenous magnesium is appropriate with dosage and treatment similar to severe asthma exacerbations. **Vasopressors**\nVasopressors may be substituted when a patient requires more doses of epinephrine but have unacceptable side effects from the epinephrine intravenous infusion (arrhythmia or chest pain). If no clear second-line pressor is identified, treatment guidelines would follow those of any other patient in hypotensive shock. **Glucagon**\nGlucagon is the reversal agent for beta-blockers and can be used as such if needed in cases where anaphylaxis is resistant to treatment in patients with beta-blockade. Known side effects include nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, dizziness, and hyperglycemia. A therapeutic agent under research:\n**Sirtuin 6**\nA NAD-dependent deacetylase suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type C transcription. This, in turn, leads to negative regulation of the FcERI signaling cascade in mast cells. Hence, activation of Sirt6 can be tried as a therapeutic strategy for anaphylaxis."

Prognosis\nWith rapid and adequate treatment and monitoring, the risk of morbidity and mortality is low. Rapid access to medical care and identification of the disease process are essential to patient prognosis. As stated above, the first hour after symptoms exposure is responsible for half of the related fatalities. Hospital admission is required in 4% or less of acute allergic reactions diagnosed in the emergency department. If epinephrine is required, as in cases of anaphylaxis, complete resolution is noted. Emergency department observation for 4 hours is recommended. If no further intervention is required, the patient can be discharged home with a prescription for an epinephrine autoinjector, and follow-up is appropriate. If the patient requires airway intervention, is refractory to treatment, or is deemed unstable, admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring is advised. Patients with a history of biphasic reactions, severe reactions, beta-blocker use, older, those who live alone, or those with poor access to health care or deemed at risk should be monitored longer. Along with the prescription for an epinephrine pen, antihistamines and corticosteroids are appropriate for 3 to 5 days. If the inciting source is unknown and the patient has a prolonged time before follow-up, consider corticosteroid use for 1 to 2 weeks with an appropriate taper. Also, consider writing for multiple epinephrine autoinjectors to ensure they are kept in various locations (home, school, work, and vehicle). Educate and document the need for 24-hour access to the epinephrine autoinjector if symptoms begin to recur."

Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n**An Evidence-based Approach to Anaphylaxis**\nAnaphylaxis is a rapid systemic and unpredictable disorder that is life-threatening. The disorder often occurs after exposure to certain antigens, mostly insect venom, food, or medications. The condition is immune-mediated and rapidly induces symptoms. For those who have not encountered anaphylaxis, the diagnosis can be difficult. In the United States, the rates of anaphylaxis have doubled over the past 20 years, and at least 1500 people die from the disorder each year. The potentially life-threatening nature of the disorder makes it imperative that one be prepared and offer prompt treatment. This is 1 of the few medical disorders during which a healthcare worker does not have the luxury of time. Having epinephrine on hand can be life-saving if one wants to avoid a fatal outcome. However, despite considerable evidence that epinephrine is the drug of choice, it is under-used. Instead, many healthcare workers use an antihistamine, a drug that does not prevent or relieve all the manifestations of anaphylaxis. In addition, the antihistamine does not even start to work for 1 to 3 hours, depending on the route of administration. Given these findings, all healthcare workers must be educated on anaphylaxis and its treatment. Evidence indicates that healthcare workers are critical for managing and preventing anaphylaxis. Since people may develop anaphylaxis almost anywhere, all healthcare workers must know the signs and symptoms of the disorder and know how to administer epinephrine. The pharmacist is in a key position to educate the patient and family about anaphylaxis. Plus, the pharmacist can teach the patient and family to carry epinephrine with them all the time."
