    "text": "Introduction\nCentral sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by transient diminution or cessation of the respiratory rhythm generator located within the pontomedullary region of the brain. In general, CSA represents an array of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) conditions due to the brief absence of ventilatory output during sleep. CSA manifests as a cyclical phenomenon/pattern during sleep; periods of apnea or hypopnea alternating with hyperpnea. Although there is a lack of effort during central events, it has been found that the upper airway narrows or nearly collapses during these events. Upper airway narrowing consistently occurs at the retropalatal level during induced hypocapnic central apnea (video 1) and induced central hypopnea.\nThough the prevalence of CSA is lower than OSA, both conditions often coexist, and patients can exhibit features of both states. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders \u2013 Third Edition (ICSD-3)  has divided CSA syndromes into several categories based on distinct clinical and polysomnographic features;\n1. Primary CSA\n1. CSA with Cheyne-Stokes Breathing (CSB)\n1. CSA due to a medical disorder without CSB\n1. CSA due to a periodic high-altitude breathing\n1. CSA due to a medication or substance\n1. Treatment-emergent CSA\nBoth hypoventilation and hyperventilation can result in central apneas, and each one acts through a distinct pathophysiological pathway. Thus, the degree of alveolar ventilation often serves as a basis for an alternate classification of CSA. Patients with heart failure are often hypocapnic during wakefulness and have an increased propensity to develop hyperventilation related CSA; however, hypoventilation related CSA commonly occur in neuromuscular diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke), overuse of medications with side effects of central nervous system depression (opioids), cervical spinal cord injury and structural abnormalities affecting pulmonary dynamics (kyphoscoliosis)."

    "text": "Pathophysiology\nThe pathophysiology of CSA can be variable due to its temporal relation with different comorbidities. Depending on the underlying medical condition, hypoventilation or hyperventilation with resultant hypocapnia below an apneic threshold is an integral mechanism that reinforces the evolution of central apnea. Reduced ventilatory drive during NREM sleep can induce central apnea and hypopnea even in healthy individuals. The mechanism is complex, but studies have shown that central chemoreceptors and upper airway mechanics play important roles. In addition, ventilatory control can contribute to the resultant central apnea in a susceptible patient population, particularly patients with neuromuscular disorders (such as spinal cord injury) or chest wall abnormalities (such as kyphoscoliosis).\nThe enhanced chemosensitivity to arterial carbon dioxide levels during sleep results in overall increased loop gain, leading to ventilatory instability and CSA, especially in patients with HF. Opioids and other medications with CNS sedating properties can suppress the respiratory rhythm generator located within the brainstem. Thus, the development of CSA can be attributed either to reduced central ventilatory motor output or high loop gain. Regardless of the underlying condition or mechanism, once a cycle has started, it perpetuates the next one, resulting in repetitive episodes of hypoxia and irregular breathing, ultimately leading to upper airway narrowing."

History and Physical\nPatients with CSA present with stereotypical complaints related to disrupted sleep, which are akin to the other forms of sleep apnea. They typically complain of poor-quality sleep, nocturnal awakening, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), morning headache, fatigue, and impaired concentration span. However, snoring occasionally is not a prominent feature of CSA. While OSA and CSA are two different entities, sometimes they coexist, and patients have mixed characteristics. Increased body weight index is associated with an increased risk of OSA; however, patients with CSA are relatively less obese.\nAdditional symptoms are pertinent to the underlying disease process in patients with hypercapnic central apnea. An interesting clinical observation about the patients with HF is that they often don't recognize or report daytime symptoms despite the objective evidence of sleepiness. Increased daytime sympathetic activity can explain this lack of perceived disrupted sleep, which augments alertness and counteracts sleepiness.\nA recent study demonstrated an inverse relationship between the degree of subjective daytime sleepiness and mortality risk. Thus, the presumptive diagnosis of sleep apnea should be considered in HF elderly patients with subjective complaints of fatigue even if they lack typical EDS."

Thus, the presumptive diagnosis of sleep apnea should be considered in HF elderly patients with subjective complaints of fatigue even if they lack typical EDS. Evaluation\nEarly detection and diagnosis of CSA can be challenging solely based on self-reported symptoms of disrupted sleep. Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic test in evaluating central apnea is nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). The diagnostic criteria for CSA were published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) in ICSD-3  and varies according to the type of CSA. It generally requires evidence of recurrent central apneas on PSG recording and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Central apnea is defined as a cessation of flow during sleep for at least 10 seconds without effort (figure 1).\n- Diagnosis of primary CSA can be made if PSG reveals \u22655 central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour of sleep, with a total number of these central events being >50% of total respiratory events in the apnea-hypopnea index with no evidence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB). Additionally, there must be at least one complaint related to disrupted sleep, i.e., sleepiness, insomnia, awakening with shortness of breath, snoring, or witnessed apneas.\n- Diagnosis of CSA with CSB requires the criteria of primary CSA with three or more consecutive central apneas or hypopneas separated by a crescendo\u2013decrescendo respiratory pattern with a cycle length of \u226540 seconds.\n- Diagnosis of treatment-emergent central apnea requires to have a primary diagnosis of OSA (with an apnea-hypopnea index \u2265 5 obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep) followed by resolution of the obstructive apnea and emergence or persistence of CSA (not explained by the presence of other disease or substance) during positive airway pressure (PAP) titration study."

    "text": "Treatment / Management\nThe primary goals in CSA management are to stabilize sleep by suppressing abnormal respiratory events and optimizing the treatment of comorbid conditions. Positive airway pressure (PAP) remains a standard treatment for both central and obstructive apnea that can be delivered as continuous PAP (CPAP), Bi-level PAP therapy (BPAP), and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). Apart from PAP devices, additional therapeutic options include supplemental Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pharmacologic agents. A longitudinal study demonstrated that CPAP and BPAP are more effective for CSA management in HF and opioid use. The heterogeneity of disease necessitates individualized therapies for the proper management of CSA rather than a homogenous treatment approach. The treatment can include mechanical pressure devices, Oxygen, nerve stimulators, and/or pharmacological therapies. **Mechanical Devices**\n- CPAP; has been recommended as the first-line therapy for CSA. Available literature and data support CPAP's beneficial effect on CSA. It can be explained by its ability to maintain airway patency, stabilizing the compensatory ventilatory output. In concurrent obstructive episodes, CPAP is a reasonable therapeutic option. The Canadian CPAP (CANPAP) trial was the most extensive randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of CPAP on morbidity and mortality in patients with CSA and HF. The study did reveal a modest reduction in mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) to 19 events per hour of sleep without significant effect on mortality. A subsequent post hoc analysis showed a reduction in mortality rate in those patients who responded to CPAP therapy. - BPAP; It can be a viable option in hypercapnic CSA, especially if the patient is unresponsive to CPAP. Dohi et al. suggested the effectiveness of BPAP in patients with HF and CSA with CSB. BPAP acts to normalize the AHI by increasing ventilation and augmenting alveolar volume. A longitudinal cross-section study also suggested using CPAP and BiPAP to treat opioid-related CSA. - ASV; is a form of PAP that provides ventilatory support individualized to the patient's effort."

A longitudinal cross-section study also suggested using CPAP and BiPAP to treat opioid-related CSA. - ASV; is a form of PAP that provides ventilatory support individualized to the patient's effort. A servo-controlled inspiratory pressure is delivered over positive end-expiratory pressure based on the detection of apneas. It remains a therapeutic option for CSA patients with preserved EF and improves AHI and left ventricular EF (LVEF). A multicenter largest trial (SERVE-HF) revealed that the use of ASV was associated with increased mortality in HF patients with reduced EF. Therefore, ASV is not recommended for the treatment of CSA in this particular group of patients. Nocturnal oxygen therapy in previous trials has decreased the number of apneic episodes during sleep times for patients with CHF. It also improved NYHA functional class quality of life, and EF was noted at the end of 12-week in patients with central sleep apnea. These findings were confirmed over 52 weeks in a similar trial, ensuring improved quality of life. Unilateral placement of phrenic nerve stimulators is another treatment option for patients with central sleep apnea. A recent study suggested that such therapy was associated with decreased disease severity and improved quality of life. It also resulted in significant improvement in the arousal index, improved quality of life, and a decreased self-reported daytime sleepiness. These benefits were independent of heart failure status. Peripheral nerve stimulation works by restoring the normal physiological mechanics of breathing. Different pharmacological agents have been studied as a potential treatment for central sleep apnea. However, these medications remain investigational, and there is no approved pharmacological treatment for CSA. Hypnotics such as triazolam and zolpidem can reduce wakefulness and unstable sleep. These medications may lead to increased total sleep, decreased central apnea index, and a decrease in brief arousals. Respiratory stimulants such as acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, work by causing mild metabolic acidosis, resulting in increased respiratory drive decreases the frequency of central apneas. Recently, other medications such as Buspirone and Mirtazapine have been studied. Both drugs reduced the susceptibility to developing hypocapnic central apnea in individuals with spinal cord injuries."

This disruption leads to fragmented, nonrestorative sleep. Symptoms include loud, disruptive snoring, witnessed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. This condition has significant implications for cardiovascular health, mental well-being, quality of life, and driving safety. Diagnosis involves polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. Treatment options include continuous positive airway pressure therapy, oral appliances, and surgical interventions.\nThis activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of OSA, as well as examines its causes, risk factors, and advancements in diagnostic techniques. This activity also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in managing OSA and fosters effective communication and teamwork among healthcare professionals. In addition, this activity provides interprofessional healthcare providers with insights into the latest advancements in diagnostic techniques and evidence-based treatment modalities, ensuring comprehensive care delivery and improved patient outcomes in OSA management.\n**Objectives:**\n- Identify key symptoms and risk factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea to accurately recognize at-risk individuals.\n- Implement evidence-based management strategies, including continuous positive airway pressure therapy, oral appliances, and surgery, to improve patient care.\n- Select the most appropriate diagnostic techniques and treatment options based on the individual patient's clinical presentation and preferences.\n- Collaborate with the interprofessional healthcare team to improve outcomes and provide comprehensive care for patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea."

Etiology\nPharyngeal narrowing and closure during sleep is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. Sleep-related reductions in ventilatory drive, neuromuscular factors, and anatomical risk factors all contribute significantly to upper airway obstruction during sleep.\nAnatomical factors that promote pharyngeal narrowing include a large neck circumference, excess soft tissue, bony structures, or blood vessels. Many of these structures can increase pressure around the upper airway, leading to pharyngeal collapsibility and insufficient space for airflow in part of the upper airway during sleep.\nIn addition, the upper airway muscle tone is crucial; when muscle tone decreases, it leads to a repetitive total or partial airway collapse.

    "text": "History and Physical\nPatients with suspected OSA usually present with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping, choking, or witnessed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the most common symptoms. Many patients may only report daytime fatigue, with or without other associated symptoms. Therefore, it is important to objectively assess the distinction between sleepiness and fatigue. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) can be used to quantitatively evaluate the severity of sleepiness. The ESS score ranges from 0 to 24; a score above 9 suggests excessive daytime sleepiness and warrants additional assessment. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) can also be used to assess the severity of fatigue symptoms. The ESS and FSS are helpful tools, as sleepiness and fatigue symptoms may occur concurrently. Other symptoms may include morning headaches, nocturnal reflux, insomnia, and nocturia. Symptoms of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia are more commonly reported by women. The STOP-BANG questionnaire is one of the most widely accepted screening tools for OSA. - Snoring: Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors)? - Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime? - Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep? - Blood pressure: Are you currently being treated for high blood pressure? - BMI: Is your BMI greater than 35 kg/m2? - Age: Are you of age 50 or older? - Neck circumference: Is your neck circumference greater than 40 cm? - Sex: Are you male? The STOP-BANG questionnaire can be used to assess the probability of moderate-to-severe OSA. A high risk is indicated if \"YES\" is selected for 5 or more items, while a low risk is indicated if \"YES\" is answered for fewer than 3 items. Obesity is the most common finding in individuals with OSA."

Obesity is the most common finding in individuals with OSA. Evaluation\nAdult patients with unexplained daytime or sleep-related symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep, should be evaluated for sleep apnea. However, universal screening for OSA is not recommended in asymptomatic patients, except for those at risk due to occupational hazards, such as drivers or pilots. In addition, due to the high prevalence of OSA and its disease burden, patients with specific comorbidities, including refractory atrial fibrillation, resistant hypertension, and a history of stroke, should also be screened for sleep apnea, regardless of symptoms. Nighttime in-laboratory level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing OSA. During the test, patients are monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography belts around the chest and abdomen to monitor motion, an electrocardiogram (ECG) lead, and electromyogram sensors to detect muscle contractions in the chin, chest, and legs (see **Image. ** Polysomnography, 120-Second Window Showing Obstructive Sleep Apnea). Scoring respiratory events in adults relies on 4 primary channels:\n- Oronasal thermal sensor\n- Nasal air pressure transducer\n- Inductance plethysmography (with esophageal manometry or a pressure catheter may be used as alternatives)\n- Pulse oximetry\nA snoring monitor is a required channel but does not contribute to the scoring of respiratory events. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), hypopnea is defined by either 1 of 2 criteria:\n- A reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds, accompanied by at least 4% oxygen desaturation (eg, Medicare criteria)."

Scoring apnea requires both of the following criteria to be met:\n- A drop in the peak signal excursion by more than or equal to 90% of the pre-event baseline flow. - A duration of the flow reduction of more than or equal to 10 seconds. As mentioned below, apneas are usually further classified based on respiratory effort, which is determined by respiratory inductance plethysmography signals (see **Image. ** Polysomnography Showing Central and Obstructive Sleep Apneas). - Obstructive sleep apnea: If an increased effort is present throughout the entire apnea. - Central sleep apnea: If no effort is detected throughout the entire apnea. Mixed apnea is characterized by an absence of effort during the initial portion of the event, followed by the resumption of effort in the latter part of the apnea. Home sleep tests or portable monitoring have gained popularity due to their accessibility and lower cost. However, portable monitoring should be conducted following specific rules and procedures as outlined by the AASM Unattended Portable Monitoring Task Force guidelines. These guidelines include the following criteria:\n- At a minimum, the portable monitoring device must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation. - The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors traditionally used in in-laboratory PSG should also be utilized in portable monitoring. - Portable monitoring testing must be conducted under the oversight of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program, with established written policies and procedures. - An experienced sleep technologist or technician must apply the sensors or provide direct patient education on proper sensor application. - The portable monitoring device must display raw data and allow a trained sleep technologist or technician to manually score or edit automated scoring."

Under these specified conditions, portable monitoring may be used for unattended studies in the patient's home. - A follow-up visit should be scheduled to review test results for all patients undergoing portable monitoring. - Patients with a high pretest probability of moderate-to-severe OSA who receive negative or technically inadequate portable monitoring results should undergo in-laboratory PSG. Unattended portable monitoring and home sleep tests are suitable for adults with a high pretest probability of sleep apnea and no significant medical comorbidities, such as advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or neurological disorders. These are level 3 sleep tests, which include pulse oximetry, heart rate monitoring, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, resistance belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, and a sensor to monitor body position. Moderate and severe sleep apnea can be detected using these tests. However, due to the potential underestimation of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) relative to the total recording time (which may exceed the total sleep time measured in an in-laboratory study), mild sleep apnea may go undiagnosed. In such cases, a repeat in-laboratory study may be necessary. A proposed algorithm for the appropriate use of portable monitoring and in-laboratory PSG is outlined in the **Image. ** Sleep Apnea Testing Modalities. One of the main limitations of home sleep testing is that most studies use total recording time as the denominator for calculating the AHI, rather than total sleep time, due to the absence of EEG sensors to differentiate sleep from wakefulness. This approach can lead to an underestimation of the AHI by at least 20%."

The AASM recommends using the term respiratory event index (REI) to differentiate the indices of respiratory events generated by a home sleep study (without recorded sleep). The AHI and REI represent the average number of obstructive events per hour, during sleep or recording time, respectively. Although most portable monitoring devices include flow sensors, other technologies, such as peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), use alternative methods without flow to identify sleep-disordered breathing events. The severity of OSA obtained using PAT devices is referred to as pAHI, which has been reported to provide indices similar to those derived from PSG-based AHI. The severity of OSA in adults is classified based on AHI, REI, or pAHI as follows:\n- Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour\n- Moderate: Greater than 15 to 30 events per hour\n- Severe: Greater than 30 events per hour\nThe disease burden in mild OSA is controversial and is primarily based on associated clinical sequelae, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep maintenance insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction. Recent studies have challenged the traditional definition and scoring criteria of OSA in adults due to its limitations in capturing the pathophysiological impact on individual patients. Various metrics have been proposed to improve the precision in diagnosing OSA, including hypoxic burden, nocturnal heart rate changes, total sleep time with SpO2 less than 90% (TST90), duration of obstructive events, sleep arousal burden, and even genetic factors."

Treatment / Management\nManaging OSA requires a multifaceted approach that should be tailored to each patient. While treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes, evidence regarding the impact of therapy on mild OSA remains limited or inconsistent, particularly in relation to neurocognition, mood, vehicle accidents, cardiovascular events, stroke, and arrhythmias. **Lifestyle Changes and Treating Underlying Medical Conditions**\nThe importance of weight loss should be emphasized in patients with OSA who are overweight or have obesity. Although weight loss is recommended and can often decrease the severity of OSA, it is usually not curative. Patients should be educated about the impact of sleep duration on their health and encouraged to prioritize getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and certain antidepressants, as these may exacerbate their condition. Concomitant nasal obstruction should be addressed with nasal steroids for allergic rhinitis or surgically for nasal valve collapse. For patients with lung or heart conditions, such as asthma or heart failure, optimizing the treatment of these disorders is crucial. **Positional Therapy**\nOSA that is more pronounced in the supine position can be treated with a positioning device to maintain side-sleeping, which can be an effective option. **Positive Airway Pressure Therapy**\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for adults with OSA. Bilevel PAP is also better tolerated by patients who require higher pressure settings (>15 cm H2O). However, despite the high efficacy of CPAP in eliminating respiratory events, its effectiveness is limited by decreased usage during sleep and poor adherence."

However, despite the high efficacy of CPAP in eliminating respiratory events, its effectiveness is limited by decreased usage during sleep and poor adherence. Adherence to CPAP remains a significant challenge, as nearly half of patients do not consistently follow treatment after the first month. The American Thoracic Society recently published a statement on CPAP adherence tracking systems, optimal monitoring strategies, and outcome measures in adults. Standardizing CPAP adherence reports is crucial, not only by tracking the number of hours used (>4 hours per night on >70% of nights) but also by including the amount of mask leak and the residual apnea and hypopnea index. However, what constitutes the optimal adherence goal for OSA treatment remains uncertain. Recent studies have explored the utility of telemedicine adherence interventions, remote CPAP monitoring, and more interactive features with patients and their families, which have been shown to increase CPAP adherence rates. Several studies have reported conflicting findings when assessing the effect of CPAP therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA. In a recent randomized controlled trial, CPAP use for a minimum of 1 year in patients with acute coronary syndrome and OSA, without excessive daytime sleepiness, did not lower the incidence of cardiovascular events. These events were defined as cardiac-related deaths or one or more of the following outcomes\u2014acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalizations for unstable angina or transient ischemic attack. However, adherence to CPAP therapy was low (2.78 hours per night), and the follow-up period was insufficient, both of which are significant limitations of the study. In another observational cohort study with long-term follow-up, CPAP use was associated with a lower all-cause mortality rate among patients with severe OSA, particularly around years 6 to 7 of follow-up. In a more recent study, patients with coronary artery disease and OSA who did not experience excessive sleepiness but exhibited greater changes in heart rate showed more benefit from CPAP therapy."

This approach is typically most effective for candidates with appropriate dentition and mild-to-moderate sleep apnea. In a randomized clinical trial involving 126 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure was similar between CPAP and MAD after the first month of therapy. However, MAD was found to be superior to CPAP in improving quality of life measures. More recently, another randomized clinical trial demonstrated similar long-term improvements for both CPAP and MAD in self-reported neurobehavioral outcomes over a 10-year follow-up. The AASM and the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (AADSM) have developed guidelines for using MAD in patients with OSA. The AASM/AADSM guidelines recommend the following:\n- Oral appliances can be considered as an alternative to no treatment for adult patients with snoring (without OSA) or those with OSA who do not tolerate CPAP therapy or prefer an alternative treatment. - When a sleep physician prescribes oral appliance therapy for an adult patient with OSA, a qualified dentist should use a custom, titratable appliance. - A follow-up with a qualified dentist is necessary to assess for dental-related adverse effects after initiating oral appliance therapy in adult patients with OSA. - Follow-up sleep testing is required to confirm the efficacy of the treatment. **Surgical Treatments**\nUvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) involves the surgical removal of the uvula and tissue from the soft palate to create more space in the oropharynx. This procedure is sometimes performed alongside a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. However, the long-term efficacy of UPPP is limited, with fewer than 50% of patients experiencing a significant improvement in the AHI after the first year."

However, the long-term efficacy of UPPP is limited, with fewer than 50% of patients experiencing a significant improvement in the AHI after the first year. Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) involves detaching both the upper and lower jaws and surgically advancing them anteriorly to increase space in the oropharynx. This procedure is most effective for patients with retrognathia and tends to be less successful in older patients or those with larger neck circumferences. More recently, drug-induced sleep endoscopy has been used for preoperative planning, helping to identify multiple levels of obstruction in these patients and determining their candidacy for surgical treatments such as MMA or hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS). This technique enables surgeons to address nasal, soft palate, and hypopharyngeal obstructions in a single surgery. A newer treatment option is the implantable HNS, typically implanted unilaterally, although bilateral implantation has been reported recently. This instrument works by stimulating the genioglossus muscle (an upper airway dilator) during apneas, causing tongue protrusion and relieving airway obstruction. HNS effectively reduces the AHI, with a median AHI score at 12 months decreasing by 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour. HNS also improves sleepiness symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA who are unable to tolerate CPAP treatment. Adverse events following HNS, both short- and long-term, are relatively uncommon. In a study, 134 adverse events were reported from 132 patients over 5 years. The most common adverse events reported after HNS are tongue abrasion (11.0%), pain (6.2%), and device malfunction (3% to 6%)."

This treatment is typically best managed at academic or specialty sleep centers with experience in handling tracheostomy cases. Patients undergoing tracheostomy face numerous challenges, including home care, durable medical equipment needs, and family or partner education on proper tracheostomy management. Additionally, many patients with severe OSA requiring a tracheostomy often have comorbidities that further complicate treatment."

Additionally, many patients with severe OSA requiring a tracheostomy often have comorbidities that further complicate treatment. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nManaging OSA is most effectively achieved through an interprofessional team that includes a sleep specialist, primary care provider, cardiologist, otolaryngologist, dietitian, pulmonologist, neurologist, and nursing staff. Several treatment options are available for OSA, with the primary treatment being CPAP.\nAlthough clinicians oversee overall therapy, nurses and sleep evaluation personnel have a critical role. Nurses are often the first providers to detect therapeutic failure or noncompliance (eg, with CPAP machines) and should prompt clinicians to address the issue and ensure appropriate diagnostic algorithms are followed. An interprofessional care model will lead to the best possible outcomes for OSA patients, particularly given the challenges in managing the condition.\nUnfortunately, compliance with CPAP remains low. While some patients may benefit from an oral or nasal device, compliance remains challenging. Surgery is considered a last resort and should only be pursued after a thorough evaluation. Surgery does not cure the disorder, is expensive, and may lead to severe complications. The prognosis for most patients with OSA is guarded. Until weight loss is achieved, most therapies exhibit limited efficacy."
