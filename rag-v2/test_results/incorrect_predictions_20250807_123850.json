In healthy patients, succinylcholine use is associated with only 0.5 mEq/L, but in the burn patient, this response is exaggerated. The increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia is likely associated with changes in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Recent evidence suggests that burn patients have upregulated alpha7 and gamma subunit genes producing more acetylcholine receptors spread throughout the body and slightly altered receptors. These altered receptors likely have abnormal electrophysiological interactions with succinylcholine producing more significant hyperkalemia.",

Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade happens much faster than the sensitivity to succinylcholine (within the 24-48 hour window). Thus, the presenting burn patient may require higher than usual doses of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade than expected. An increased dose can partially overcome resistance to the neuromuscular blockade produced by rocuronium. Rocuronium can provide reasonably good intubating conditions with a 1.2 mg/kg dose after a significant burn injury.\n\nComplications\n\nInfection\n\nSevere burns can weaken the immune system due to increased cytokine inflammatory markers, leading to a greater risk of infection.

Burn shock is characterized by reduced end-organ perfusion and diminished cardiac output, mainly due to losses in intravascular volume. Essentially, this is a distributive shock state. Intravascular volume losses form edema at directly burned areas and unburned sites. Hemoconcentration of red blood cells occurs due to significant volume extravasation into adjacent tissue. This edematous state can obscure views of the glottic opening during direct laryngoscopy. Reduction in cardiac output is a complication of intravascular volume loss, direct myocardial depression, and increased systemic vascular resistance. During this phase, there is an increase in systemic vascular resistance caused by a surge of catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone. This leads to the constriction of blood vessels and a reduction in blood flow",

Cardiac output improves compared to the burn shock phase resulting in better end-organ perfusion. Cardiac output may increase to 2 to 3 times the normal range due to tachycardia and decreased systemic vascular resistance during this phase, further mimicking sepsis. As a result of decreased vascular resistance, blood flow subsequently improves to all organs. Arteriovenous shunting may occur, resulting in increased venous oxygen saturation. Resorption of edema may result in pulmonary edema, further compounding the damage from inhalation injuries from smoke. If excessive fluid resuscitation is given during the burn shock phase, the consequences of such actions would be observed during the hypermetabolic phase as fluid is resorbed, potentially making weaning from the ventilator intraoperatively troublesome.

Those with preexisting pulmonary hypertension are at an even greater risk of developing acute mountain sickness because of worsening ambient hypoxia-associated hemodynamics exacerbating previously elevated high pulmonary artery pressures. Only a limited amount of epidemiologic data regarding at-risk populations for HAPH is available. Some studies of South American populations report a prevalence of 18 to 55%, and the condition tends to be more common in men. Lower rates of HAPH have been reported in premenopausal women compared to men living at high altitudes. The difference in reported incidence may be secondary to female sex hormones and an associated increase in ventilatory rate and drive.\n\nPathophysiology",

Early symptoms may include irritability, lethargy, or poor feeding. Others may quickly develop respiratory distress, fever, hypothermia, or hypotension with poor perfusion and shock. Sometimes, the diagnosis may only be suspected based on laboratory findings, which may reveal hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, acidosis, or hyperbilirubinemia. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, necessary for timely diagnosis. Therefore, physicians must be aware of any factors that may increase an infant\u2019s risk of developing sepsis. Prematurity and very low birth weights are also important risk factors to consider. Maternal factors that put neonates at risk of EOS include GBS status, the presence of chorioamnionitis, infant prematurity, or prolonged rupture of membranes . Consider whether the patient has indwelling foreign bodies such as a central venous catheter or endotracheal tube for late-onset infection, depends on parenteral nutrition, or receives proton-pump inhibitor or histamine-2 blocking therapy.\n\nEvaluation",

Any antibiotic or treatment plan changes must be communicated to the parents.Upon hospital discharge, caregivers of all infants, including healthy newborns, should be educated to watch for signs of illness or sepsis. These may include fever, jaundice, increased lethargy, decreased feeding habits, difficulty or increased breathing, and cyanosis of the fingertips and toes. Caregivers should be informed to call their doctors if their neonate experiences any of these symptoms, as they could indicate LOS.\n\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes",

LDH is a tetrameric enzyme made of H and M subunits. The assembly of the enzymes occurs in a defined ratio through a tissue-specific synthesis of subunits, hence providing tissue specificity, i.e., heart-specific LDH (LDH-1) preferentially synthesizes all four H subunits, while liver LDH (LDH-5) is exclusively made of all M-subunits. Similarly, other tissues synthesize the subunits in a specified ratio. LDH isozyme testing identifies the isozymes as LDH 1 to 5 based on the electrophoretic mobility shift. The different subunit composition imparts a difference in the net charges and hence a different migration in an electric field. A good separation pattern of LDH isozymes is obtained in a buffer of pH of 8.6. In a typical LDH isozyme electrophoretic pattern, LDH-1 moves as a fast band, followed by LDH-2, LDH-3, LDH-4, and LDH-5 being the slowest band. The normal serum percentage of LDH-1 (4H) is 30.4 to 36.4%, LDH-2 (3H1M) is 30.4 to 36.4%, LDH-3 (2H2M) is 19.2 to 24.8%, LDH-4 (1H3M) is 9.6 to 15.6%, and LDH-5 (4M) is 5.5 to 12.7%.",

The L-isomers use and produce L-lactate, which is the major enantiomeric form of lactate present in the vertebrates. The gene that encodes the LDHA form of the enzyme is located on chromosome 11p15.4 and is transcribed into a 332 amino acid protein. The LDHB gene is located on chromosome 12p12.1 and encodes a protein of 334 amino acids. The isozyme forms of Lactate dehydrogenase enzymes, LDH-1 through LDH-5 are translational products of two genes LDHA and LDHB gene . The two genes provide instructions for making the lactate dehydrogenase-A and lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. There are five different forms of LDH, each made up of four subunits. Various combinations of the protein products of lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits and lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits produced from a different gene) make up the different forms of the enzyme.",

This lactate is further absorbed mostly by the liver and kidney, where it undergoes oxidation for the synthesis of glucose. In the brain, about 10% of the lactate oxidizes to fuel 8% of cerebral energy needs during resting conditions, and the remaining lactate is released in circulation.

Several studies have shown that some treatments recommended for managing other causes of pulmonary hypertension have improved symptoms and mPAPs. Patients suffering from HAPH should be advised to move to lower altitudes. Some studies have shown that mPAPs for patients have normalized within 2 years of returning to lower altitudes. Pharmacological treatments for HAPH can include phosphodiesterase and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n\nPhosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, Sildenafil) block the breakdown of nitrous oxide, promote pulmonary artery vasodilation, and decrease mPAP.",

These cases require hospital admission and chest tube insertion (ranging from 20 to 28 French), which is typically connected to a water-seal device with or without additional suctioning.\n\nManagement of Unstable Patients\n\nPatients with traumatic or tension pneumothorax require emergent thoracostomy or chest tube placement. In most cases, non-tension pneumothorax can be effectively managed with small-bore pigtail catheters inserted using the Seldinger technique. Very large pneumothoraces may necessitate large-bore chest tubes. A thoracostomy with a large-bore chest tube insertion is necessary if there is a concomitant hemothorax.\n\nStudies have shown that simple aspiration has a higher failure rate compared to chest tube drainage when used as the initial management strategy for complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases. As a result, chest tube placement is often preferred in patients with large or recurrent pneumothoraces to ensure adequate lung reexpansion and reduce the risk of early recurrence.\n\nAir Drainage Techniques",

Evidence suggests that needle aspiration is as safe and effective as tube thoracostomy in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. A recent randomized clinical trial involving unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax revealed that conservative observation was not inferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events compared to invasive techniques. These patients may require hospital admission for observation. Although oxygen therapy with serial chest radiographs is sometimes used, there are limited supporting data. Importantly, positive pressure-generating therapies, such as noninvasive ventilation or high nasal flow nasal cannula, should not be used due to the risk of air leaks and worsening pneumothorax.",

Although ketone levels are generally elevated in DKA, a negative measurement initially does not exclude the diagnosis because ketone laboratory measurements often use the nitroprusside reaction, which only estimates acetoacetate and acetone levels that may not be elevated initially as beta-hydroxybutyrate is the major ketone that is elevated. The anion-gap is elevated, as mentioned above, because ketones are unmeasured anions. Leukocytosis may indicate an infectious pathology as the trigger and cultures are sent from blood, urine, or other samples as clinically indicated",

During catabolic states, fatty acids are metabolized to ketone bodies, which can be readily utilized for fuel by individual cells in the body. Of the three major ketone bodies, acetoacetic acid is the only true ketoacid chemically, while beta-hydroxybutyric acid is a hydroxy acid, and acetone is a true ketone. Figure 1 shows the schematic of ketogenesis where the fatty acids generated after lipolysis in the adipose tissues enter the hepatocytes via the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to form the various ketone bodies. This biochemical cascade is stimulated by the combination of low insulin levels and high glucagon levels (i.e., a low insulin/glucagon ratio). Low insulin levels, most often secondary to absolute or relative hypoglycemia as with fasting, activate hormone-sensitive lipase, which is responsible for the breakdown of triglycerides to free fatty acid and glycerol.",

The cholecystostomy tube can be removed after 3 weeks. After percutaneous drainage and recovery, outpatient tube studies by interventional radiology can confirm patency of the cystic duct before removal. Alternatively, the patient can undergo cholecystectomy between 4 and 8 weeks after tube placement.\n\nAnother treatment option is cystic duct stent placement via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to decompress the gallbladder and prevent cystic duct obstruction. However, this approach is not as widely available as percutaneous cholecystostomy, and outcomes have not been studied as extensively.\n\nSurgical Management",

Syncope is responsible for 740,000 trips to the emergency department and a quarter of a million hospital admissions each year in the United States alone. Causes of syncope range widely, including vasovagal, neurologic, metabolic, pulmonary, volume depletion, and cardiac. While most syncopal events are innocuous, cardiac syncope is often indicative of a potentially fatal, underlying disease process, carrying a one-year mortality rate of 30%. Cardiac syncope occurs when the source of one's loss of consciousness stems from a problem in the heart that prevents it from supplying enough nutrients and oxygen to the brain. This cardiac problem may be a rhythm disturbance, a structural problem, or a structural problem that predisposes a patient to a rhythm disturbance. Cardiac syncope is estimated to be the cause of syncope in 15% of syncopal events",

While most syncopal events are innocuous, cardiac syncope is often indicative of a potentially fatal, underlying disease process, carrying a one-year mortality rate of 30%. Distinguishing cardiac syncope from the myriad of other syncopal etiologies can be challenging. For this reason, it is imperative for all interprofessional team members to have a general knowledge of cardiac syncope and how to recognize it. This activity reviews a patient's workup with cardiac syncope and describes the interprofessional team's role in managing this condition.\n\nObjectives:",

The majority of these deaths occur in adults greater than 35 years of age, with at least half attributable to ventricular arrhythmias. Estimates of its prevalence vary from 30% to 75% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests despite recent increases in the incidence of pulseless electrical activity. However, the true incidence is unknown due to inevitable degeneration to asystole if unwitnessed. Despite the decline in coronary artery disease mortality and advancements in resuscitation services, survival from these events remains low, especially if occurring outside the hospital environment, with an associated survival rate of less than 10%.\n\nPathophysiology",
